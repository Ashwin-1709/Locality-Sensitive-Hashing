       "['washington congressional republicans have a new fear when it comes to their health care lawsuit against the obama administration they might win the incoming trump administration could choose to no longer defend the executive branch against the suit which challenges the administration s authority to spend billions of dollars on health insurance subsidies for and americans handing house republicans a big victory on issues but a sudden loss of the disputed subsidies could conceivably cause the health care program to implode leaving millions of people without access to health insurance before republicans have prepared a replacement that could lead to chaos in the insurance market and spur a political backlash just as republicans gain full control of the government to stave off that outcome republicans could find themselves in the awkward position of appropriating huge sums to temporarily prop up the obama health care law angering conservative voters who have been demanding an end to the law for years in another twist donald j trump s administration worried about preserving executive branch prerogatives could choose to fight its republican allies in the house on some central questions in the dispute eager to avoid an ugly political pileup republicans on capitol hill and the trump transition team are gaming out how to handle the lawsuit which after the election has been put in limbo until at least late february by the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit they are not yet ready to divulge their strategy given that this pending litigation involves the obama administration and congress it would be inappropriate to comment said phillip j blando a spokesman for the trump transition effort upon taking office the trump administration will evaluate this case and all related aspects of the affordable care act in a potentially decision in 2015 judge rosemary m collyer ruled that house republicans had the standing to sue the executive branch over a spending dispute and that the obama administration had been distributing the health insurance subsidies in violation of the constitution without approval from congress the justice department confident that judge collyer s decision would be reversed quickly appealed and the subsidies have remained in place during the appeal in successfully seeking a temporary halt in the proceedings after mr trump won house republicans last month told the court that they and the s transition team currently are discussing potential options for resolution of this matter to take effect after the s inauguration on jan 20 2017 the suspension of the case house lawyers said will provide the and his future administration time to consider whether to continue prosecuting or to otherwise resolve this appeal republican leadership officials in the house acknowledge the possibility of cascading effects if the payments which have totaled an estimated 13 billion are suddenly stopped insurers that receive the subsidies in exchange for paying costs such as deductibles and for eligible consumers could race to drop coverage since they would be losing money over all the loss of the subsidies could destabilize the entire program and cause a lack of confidence that leads other insurers to seek a quick exit as well anticipating that the trump administration might not be inclined to mount a vigorous fight against the house republicans given the s dim view of the health care law a team of lawyers this month sought to intervene in the case on behalf of two participants in the health care program in their request the lawyers predicted that a deal between house republicans and the new administration to dismiss or settle the case will produce devastating consequences for the individuals who receive these reductions as well as for the nation s health insurance and health care systems generally no matter what happens house republicans say they want to prevail on two overarching concepts the congressional power of the purse and the right of congress to sue the executive branch if it violates the constitution regarding that spending power house republicans contend that congress never appropriated the money for the subsidies as required by the constitution in the suit which was initially championed by john a boehner the house speaker at the time and later in house committee reports republicans asserted that the administration desperate for the funding had required the treasury department to provide it despite widespread internal skepticism that the spending was proper the white house said that the spending was a permanent part of the law passed in 2010 and that no annual appropriation was required even though the administration initially sought one just as important to house republicans judge collyer found that congress had the standing to sue the white house on this issue a ruling that many legal experts said was flawed and they want that precedent to be set to restore congressional leverage over the executive branch but on spending power and standing the trump administration may come under pressure from advocates of presidential authority to fight the house no matter their shared views on health care since those precedents could have broad repercussions it is a complicated set of dynamics illustrating how a quick legal victory for the house in the trump era might come with costs that republicans never anticipated when they took on the obama white house ',\n",
       " 'after the bullet shells get counted the blood dries and the votive candles burn out people peer down from windows and see crime scenes gone cold a band of yellow police tape blowing in the breeze the south bronx just across the harlem river from manhattan and once shorthand for urban dysfunction still suffers violence at levels long ago slashed in many other parts of new york city and yet the city s efforts to fight it remain splintered underfunded and burdened by scandal in the 40th precinct at the southern tip of the bronx as in other poor minority neighborhoods across the country people long hounded for infractions are crying out for more protection against grievous injury or death by september four of every five shootings in the precinct this year were unsolved out of the city s 77 precincts the 40th has the highest murder rate but the fewest detectives per violent crime reflecting disparities in staffing that hit hardest in some neighborhoods outside manhattan according to a new york times analysis of police department data investigators in the precinct are saddled with twice the number of cases the department recommends even as their bosses are called to police headquarters to answer for the sharpest crime rise in the city this year and across the bronx investigative resources are squeezed it has the highest rate of the city s five boroughs but the thinnest detective staffing nine of the 14 precinct detective squads for violent crime in the city are there the borough s robbery squad is smaller than manhattan s even though the bronx has had 1 300 more cases this year and its homicide squad has one detective for every four murders compared with one detective for roughly every two murders in upper manhattan and more than one detective per murder in lower manhattan in lobbies and family apartments outside methadone clinics and art studios people take note of the inequity they hear police commanders explain that they lack the resources to place a floodlight on a dangerous block or to post officers at a corner they watch witnesses cower behind doors more fearful of a gunman s crew than confident in the police department s ability to protect them so though people see a lot they rarely testify and in the south bronx as in so many predominantly black and hispanic neighborhoods like it in the united states the contract between the police and the community is in tatters some people have stories of crime reports that were ignored or 911 calls that went unanswered for hours others tell of a 911 call for help ending in the caller s arrest or of a minor charge leading to 12 hours in a fetid holding cell this is the paradox of policing in the 40th precinct its neighborhoods have historically been prime targets for aggressive tactics like that are designed to ward off disorder but precinct detectives there have less time than anywhere else in the city to answer for the blood spilled in violent crimes gola white who was beside her daughter when she was shot and killed in a playground this summer four years after her son was gunned down in the same housing project ticked off the public safety resources that she said were scant in bronx neighborhoods like hers security cameras lights locks investigating police officers here we have nothing she said when it comes to families she said the authorities don t really care as much that s how i feel the times has been documenting the murders logged this year in the 40th precinct one of a handful of neighborhoods where deadly violence remains a problem in an era of crime in new york city the homicides 14 in the precinct this year up from nine in 2015 strain detectives and when they go unsolved as half of them have this year some look to take the law into their own hands from hundreds of conversations with grieving relatives and friends witnesses and police officers the social forces that flare into murder in a place like the 40th precinct become clearer merciless gang codes mental illness drugs and long memories of feuds that simmered out of officers view the reasons some murders will never be solved also emerge paralyzing fear of retribution victims carrying secrets to their graves and relentless casework that forces detectives to move on in hopes that a break will come later frustrations build on all sides detectives phones rarely ring with tips and officers grow embittered with witnesses who will not cooperate in the meantime a victim s friends conduct their own investigations and talk of grabbing a stash gun from a wheel well or a mother s apartment when they find their suspect in the chasm between the police and the community gangs and gun violence flourish parents try to protect their families from drug crews threats and officers work to overcome the residue of years of mistrust and understaffing in communities where they still go racing from one 911 call to the next the streets around st mary s park were the scene of two fatal shootings logged in the 40th precinct this year both are unsolved james fernandez heard talk of the murders through the door of his apartment on east 146th street in a the betances houses he lived at the end of a long hallway strewn with hypodermic needles empty dope bags and discarded hennessy bottles a young men who spoke of being in a subset of the bloods gang had made it their drug market slinging marijuana and cocaine to regulars flashing firearms and blowing smoke into the fernandez apartment when mr fernandez 40 asked the young men to move they answered by busting up his car this kind of crime an anachronism in much of new york still rattles the 40th precinct even though murders there have fallen to 14 this year from 83 in 1991 it has more major felony crimes per resident than any other residential district in the city it is also one of the poorest communities in the country and many young men find their way into underground markets mr fernandez was not one to shrink from the threats when he was growing up on the lower east side he rode his bicycle around to the customers of the drug dealers he worked for and collected payments in a backpack after leaving that life he got a tech maintenance job and three years ago moved into the betances houses with his wife and daughter now 11 he had two choices to get help with the drug crew call the police for help and risk being labeled a snitch or call his old lower east side bosses for muscle and risk violence he chose the police again and again he walked into a local substation police service area 7 and asked for protection his daughter was using an inhaler to relieve coughs from the marijuana smoke mr fernandez and his wife got terrible headaches there s a lot of killers here and we are going to kill you a sergeant s police report quoted a telling mr fernandez in august 2015 a second report filed the same day said a warned him i m going to shoot through your window mr fernandez told the police both the teenagers names which appear in the reports and then went home he said one of their friends had seen him walk into the substation and they tried to intimidate him out of filing another report three days later the same propped his bike on their door then said if i was to open the door and say something they would body slam me mr fernandez s wife maria fernandez wrote on slips of paper she used to document the hallway ruckus and the inadequate police response the boys made comments about how easy a target she was and about how they would have to slap her if she opened the door while they made a drug sale and they threatened to beat the fernandez family because they are the ones snitching her notes say but another complaint at the substation 10 days after the first brought no relief a week later feeling desperate ms fernandez tried calling first to the substation at 8 50 p m when one of the boys blew weed smoke at her door and made a threat to attack her and then to 911 at 10 36 p m the police never came she wrote in her notes she tried the 40th precinct station house next but officers at the desk left her standing in the public waiting area for a she said making her fear being seen again officers put her in worse danger some months later she said when they came to her door and announced in front of the teenagers that they were there on a complaint about drug activity mr fernandez started doing the work that he said the police had failed to do he wired a camera into his peephole to record the drugs and guns the footage hark back to the new york of the 1980s still very much present to some of the precinct s residents around 6 30 each morning sgt michael j lopuzzo walks through the tall wooden doors of the 40th precinct station house the cases that land on his metal desk dead bodies with no known cause strip club brawls shooting victims hobbling into the hospital themselves bring resistance at every turn reminding him of an earlier era in the city s campaign i haven t got one single phone call that s putting me in the right direction here said sergeant lopuzzo the head of the precinct s detective squad one day this summer as he worked on an answer to an email inquiry from a murder victim s aunt about why the killer had not been caught and people just don t understand that often it is detectives who most feel the effects of people turning on the police witnesses shout them away from their doors just so neighbors know they refuse to talk of the 184 people who were shot and wounded in the bronx through early september more than a third 66 victims refused to cooperate over the same period in the 40th precinct squad detectives closed three of 17 nonfatal shootings and 72 of 343 robbery cases part of the resistance stems from preventive policing tactics like that were a hallmark of the style under former mayor michael r bloomberg and his police commissioner raymond w kelly near the height of the strategy in 2012 the 40th precinct had the stops in the city the stops in which officers used force and the most frisks of 18 276 stops that year 15 521 were of people who had done nothing criminal the precinct was also one of the areas that the department flooded with its newest officers at roll calls they were pressured to generate numbers write tickets and make arrests they had no choice but to give a summons to a young man playing in a park after dark even if the officers had done the same growing up in the same neighborhood i need to bring something in today to justify my existence officer argenis rosado who joined the precinct in 2010 said in an interview at the station house so now you re in a small area and day after day you re hammering the same community of course that community s eventually going to turn on you the pressure warped the way officers and residents saw each other rookies had to ignore why someone might be drinking outside or sitting on a stoop some of the cops that came out at that time probably viewed the community differently too said hector espada a veteran of the precinct not because they wanted to but because they had to because some way or somehow you can t give someone a 115 summons and feel like you guys could still have a civil conversation after that morale wilted in the aged station house on alexander avenue in mott haven officers felt pressure to downgrade crime complaints to make them appear less serious several said in interviews that they had overlooked crime reports from immigrants because they were seen as unlikely to complain and watched supervisors badger victims into repeating their stories in hopes that they would drop their complaints the practice of downgrading complaints resulted in the disciplining of 19 officers in the precinct last year one in a string of scandals that has left officers there feeling overscrutinized for problems that also existed elsewhere four commanders in the precinct were sent packing in five years one of them after officers were found to be ticket fixing or forgiving parking tickets for friends and another after he was recorded giving guidance on whom to stop and frisk black boys and men ages 14 to 21 some officers fled to other commands others became reluctant to take assignments in proactive policing units like that put them in situations on the street whenever i walked through the doors of the precinct to me it seemed like a black cloud said russell lewis a of the 40th it was like a heaviness when you walked in all you wanted to do was do your 8 hours 35 minutes and go home because you didn t want to get caught up in anything the precinct covers only about two square miles but the more than a dozen housing projects there mean that it overflows with people methadone clinics draw addicts from around the city lofts on the southern edge of the precinct presage a wave of gentrification even as the police department has hired 1 300 more officers for neighborhood policing and counterterrorism officers in the 40th precinct said they could still rush to 25 911 calls during a shift a number unchanged from what the new police commissioner james p o neill said he was handling in a similar south bronx precinct 15 years ago several dozen calls at a time can be waiting for a response residents know that if you want the police for a domestic problem it helps to hint that there is a weapon last year the precinct drew the number of civilian complaints for officer misconduct in the city and the most lawsuits stemming from police actions the precinct is trying to improve morale under a new commanding officer deputy inspector brian hennessy a cadre of what the department calls neighborhood coordination officers has been on patrol since last january part of a citywide effort under mr o neill and mayor bill de blasio to bring back the beat cop unencumbered by chasing every last 911 call who can listen to people s concerns and help with investigations the precinct has made among the most gun arrests in the city and officers said they now had more discretion to resolve encounters without a summons or an arrest at one corner near a school on courtlandt avenue and east 151st street that has long spawned complaints about gunfire and fights inspector hennessy and some of his officers painted over graffiti and swept up drug paraphernalia this summer people said it was the first answer to their complaints in years but the inspector acknowledged that the residue of policing lingers that perception really sticks he said the workload in the 40th precinct is startling and reveals a gap in how detective squads are equipped to answer violent crime in manhattan compared with the bronx brooklyn and queens three of the precinct s 16 detectives are carrying more than 400 cases each this year and many others have loads in the high 300s even though the department advises 150 in violent precincts when they are assigned a homicide they typically have four days to investigate before dealing with other cases quieter precincts can give detectives a month with little distraction to investigate a murder detectives in the 40th precinct have each handled an average of 79 violent felonies this year through murders rapes felony assaults and robberies by contrast a detective in the precinct on the southern end of staten island carries nine such cases a detective in the precinct patrolling union square and gramercy park handles 16 and a detective in the precinct for most of washington heights handles 32 the citywide median last year the 40th was the for violent crime with 65 cases per detective in the bronx as a whole a precinct detective has carried an average of 58 violent felonies this year compared with 27 in manhattan 37 in brooklyn 38 in queens and 25 on staten island rape cases and robbery patterns are later sent to more specialized units but precinct detectives do extensive initial work to interview victims write reports and process evidence precincts in much of manhattan which are whiter and wealthier than the south bronx often have more property felonies like stolen laptops or credit cards and the police say those can be complex but even accounting for those crimes the 40th precinct has some of the heaviest caseloads of overall crime per detective in the city michael palladino the head of the detectives endowment association and a former bronx officer said staffing disparities affected the department s efforts to build trust in communities like the south bronx witnesses make a calculation he said if i cooperate with the detectives there s so much work there s so few of them there they won t even get the chance to protect me or they ll be there too late when the retaliation comes sergeant lopuzzo who turned down a more prestigious post to stay in the 40th precinct said that his squad worked tirelessly to handle cases with the people he had and that while every squad wanted more detectives staffing needs for counterterrorism units and task forces had created new deployment challenges across the department we fight with the army we have not the army we wish we had he said details of how the police department assigns its 36 000 officers are closely held and constantly in flux and the public has minimal information on how personnel are allocated presented with the times s analysis of confidential staffing data the department s chief of detectives robert k boyce vowed to send more detectives to the 40th precinct and said the department would reassess its deployment more broadly in troubled precincts he said a recent decision to bring gang narcotics and vice detectives under his command made it easier to shift personnel chief boyce said the burdens on detectives went beyond felony crimes to include and cases and he noted the support that precinct squads got from centralized units focusing on robberies gangs or grand larcenies for example major crime keeps pounding the 40th precinct at rates that in 2015 were only a tenth of a percent lower than in 2001 even as citywide crime dropped by more than a third over the same period but the precinct s detective squad shrank by about eight investigators during those years according to staffing data obtained from the city council through a freedom of information law request the squad covering union square and gramercy park where crime dropped by a third over that period grew by about 11 investigators the 40th precinct was given an additional detective and four investigators this summer when it was already missing three detectives for illness or other reasons retired detectives are skeptical that community relations alone can drive down crime in the city s last the busiest precincts rather they say the police department should be dedicating more resources to providing the same sort of robust investigative response that seems standard in manhattan any crime in manhattan has to be solved said howard landesberg who was a 40th precinct detective in the late 1980s the outer boroughs are like forgotten retired detectives said that understaffing made it harder to solve crimes in the bronx brooklyn and queens where the higher prevalence of gang and drug killings already saddled investigators with cases in which people were not inclined to cooperate through detectives had closed 67 percent of homicides in manhattan and 76 percent of those in staten island this year compared with 54 percent of those in the bronx 42 percent of those in queens and 31 percent of those in brooklyn of last year s homicides detectives cleared 71 percent in manhattan 63 percent in the bronx 62 percent in queens 57 percent in staten island and 31 percent in brooklyn it s the culture of the police department that they worry about manhattan said joseph l giacalone a former sergeant in the bronx cold case squad in part because that s where the money is he added when de blasio came in he talked about the tale of two cities and then he s done the complete opposite of what he said it s just business as usual the bronx s struggles extend into prosecutions in each of the last five years prosecutors in the bronx have declined to prosecute violent felony cases more than anywhere else in the city and the rate of conviction in the bronx is routinely the lowest in the city as well but has ticked up this year to surpass brooklyn s rate through november as bronx prosecutors work to streamline cases some cases have become even more difficult to win because of the problem in the 40th precinct which has allowed defense lawyers to attack the credibility of officers who were implicated said patrice o shaughnessy a spokeswoman for the bronx district attorney s office the district attorney darcel d clark elected in 2015 said in a statement i was a judge here in the bronx and i heard from jurors that they can t be impartial because they don t trust the police against that tide of mistrust sergeant lopuzzo s detectives work 36 hours straight on some fresh cases they buy chinese takeout with their own money for a murder suspect they carry surveillance videos home in hopes that their personal computers may enhance them better than a squad computer they buy an urn for a homeless mother who has her murdered son s ashes in a box in the months after a killing they can seem like the only people in this glittering city who are paying attention to the 40th precinct s homicide victims newly fatherless children go back to school without a therapist s help victims families wander confused through a courthouse and nearly miss an appearance newspapers largely ignore killings of people with criminal pasts pushing them down the priority lists of the chiefs at police headquarters in a stuffy squad room the detectives of the 40th precinct grapple with an inheritance of government neglect they meet mothers who believe their sons might never have been murdered had a city guidance counselor listened to pleas to help them stay enrolled or had a city housing worker fixed the locks or lights on a building and the detectives work alongside a vicious system on the streets for punishing police cooperators young men scan court paperwork in prison looking for the names of people who turned on them one murder victim in the precinct this year was cast out of his crew after he avoided being arrested with them in a gang takedown some believed he was cooperating a longtime 40th precinct detective jeff meenagh said a witness in a homicide case was going to testify until he went back to his neighborhood and was told that anyone who testified would get what you deserve the allies sergeant lopuzzo makes are friendly only for so long he helped clear a woman s son of a robbery charge by locating surveillance video that proved he was not the robber the mother started calling with tips under a code name about a gun under a car for example but she always refused to testify and she cut ties this year after sergeant lopuzzo arrested her son in the stabbing of two people and her in a shooting new york city owns east 146th street and the buildings on each side but james fernandez in the betances houses said the reality on the ground was different the drug boss ran the block by october mr fernandez was increasingly afraid and fed up mr fernandez and his wife went so far as to give officers keys to the building door so they could get in whenever they wanted showed them the videos and offered them access to his camera so they could see what was happening in the hallway a couple of officers said they needed a supervisor s permission to do more others answered that the young men were only making threats officers occasionally stopped outside their building causing the young men to scatter but did not come inside mr fernandez said the menacing worsened mr fernandez s daughter was harassed as she arrived home from school she grew more and more distressed and her parents had her start seeing a therapist mr fernandez made several complaints at the office of the borough president ruben diaz jr and visited a victim s advocate in the district attorney s office on oct 20 2015 he sent an online note to the police commissioner s office we went to all proper channels for help the note said both precincts failed us except 2 officers who helped us but their hands are tied no one else to turn to i have months of video of multiple crimes taking place and we are in extreme danger 40th and psa 7 won t do anything he wrote referring to the local substation please we need to speak to some one with authority the local substation commander deputy inspector jerry o sullivan and the bronx narcotics unit were alerted to the complaints but mr fernandez said he never heard from them so he relied on his own street instincts to protect his family he made pleas to a man he thought was employing the dealers in the hallway the activity quieted briefly but it returned after the young men rented a room in a woman s apartment upstairs mr fernandez approached a different man who he learned was the boss of the operation the man agreed to ask the dealers to calm down he even hired a drug customer to sweep the hallway mr fernandez said but two weeks later the dealing and the harassment resumed so he went to his old lower east side bosses who hired men to trail his wife and daughter on their way out of the building and make sure they made it safely to school at other times they sat outside the betances houses he also bought two bulletproof vests for about 700 each he could not find one small enough for his daughter i have no faith in the city of new york i have no faith in the police i have no faith in the politicians mr fernandez said the only thing i know for sure god if we re in a situation again i will be left to defend my family paying such close attention to what was happening in the hallway mr fernandez said he learned some details about two recent homicides that the 40th precinct was investigating but because his calls for help were going nowhere he said he decided not to put himself in greater risk by talking he would not tell the police what he had learned i m bending over backward and nobody s not even doing anything he said why am i going to help you if you ain t going to help me by last january a new neighborhood coordination officer was working with residents of the betances houses and ended up with the most arrests in his housing command inspector o sullivan said chief boyce said that the silos in which gang and narcotics detectives used to work made responding to complaints more difficult but that the recent restructuring would remove those obstacles no one should live like mr fernandez lived with people dealing drugs outside of his apartment he said mr fernandez s complaints did not spur any arrests but two men from the hallway were caught separately this year in shootings one of them whom mr fernandez named in a police report was charged this summer with hitting an officer with a metal folding chair and firing three gunshots into a crowd court papers say he is being held on rikers island on an attempted murder charge that was too late for mr fernandez by may he had moved his family away ',\n",
       " 'when walt disney s bambi opened in 1942 critics praised its spare haunting visual style vastly different from anything disney had done before but what they did not know was that the film s striking appearance had been created by a chinese immigrant artist who took as his inspiration the landscape paintings of the song dynasty the extent of his contribution to bambi which remains a mark for film animation would not be widely known for decades like the film s title character the artist tyrus wong weathered irrevocable separation from his mother and in the hope of making a life in america incarceration isolation and rigorous interrogation all when he was still a child in the years that followed he endured poverty discrimination and chronic lack of recognition not only for his work at disney but also for his fine art before finding acclaim in his 90s mr wong died on friday at 106 a hollywood studio artist painter printmaker calligrapher illustrator and in later years maker of fantastical kites he was one of the most celebrated artists of the 20th century but because of the marginalization to which were long subject he passed much of his career unknown to the general public artistic recognition when mr wong did find it was all the more noteworthy for the fact that among chinese immigrant men of his generation professional prospects were largely limited to menial jobs like houseboy and laundryman trained as a painter mr wong was a leading figure in the modernist movement that flourished in california between the first and second world wars in 1932 and again in 1934 his work was included in group shows at the art institute of chicago that also featured picasso matisse and paul klee as a staff artist for hollywood studios from the 1930s to the 1960s he drew storyboards and made vibrant paintings as detailed as any architectural illustrations that helped the director envision each scene before it was shot over the years his work informed the look of animated pictures for disney and films for warner brothers and other studios among them the sands of iwo jima 1949 rebel without a cause 1955 and the wild bunch 1969 but of the dozens of films on which he worked it was for bambi that mr wong was belatedly most renowned he was truly involved with every phase of production john canemaker an animator and a historian of animation at new york university said in an interview for this obituary in march he created an art direction that had really never been seen before in animation in 2013 and 2014 mr wong was the subject of water to paper

being a paper son in the hope of circumventing the chinese exclusion act of 1882 signed into law by president chester a arthur the act which drastically curtailed the number of chinese people allowed to enter the country was among the earliest united states laws to impose severe restrictions on immigration but in 1906 an unforeseen loophole opened in the form of the san francisco earthquake and fire because a huge number of municipal documents including birth and immigration records were destroyed many newly arrived chinese capitalized on the loss maintaining that they had been born in san francisco before the fire as united states citizens they were entitled to bring over their relatives or in the case of gen yeo and his father paper sons posing as relatives attuned to the deception united states immigration officials put chinese arrivals through a formidable inquisition to ensure they were who they claimed to be the questions came like gunfire in which direction does your

americanized tai yow to tyrus and he was known as tyrus wong ever after soon afterward father and son were separated once more when the elder mr wong moved to los angeles to seek work for reasons that have been lost to time he could not take his son tyrus lived on his own in a sacramento boardinghouse while attending elementary school two years later possibly more tyrus traveled to los angeles to join his father who had found work in a gambling den they lived in a boardinghouse sandwiched between a butcher shop and a brothel after school tyrus worked as a houseboy for two pasadena families earning 50 cents a day his first art teacher was his father who trained him nightly in calligraphy by having him dip a brush in water and trace ghostly characters on newspaper they could not afford ink or drawing paper when tyrus was in junior high a teacher noting his drawing talent arranged a summer scholarship to the otis art institute in los angeles by his own account an indifferent student in public school tyrus found his calling at the institute now the otis college of art and design when his scholarship ended he declined to return to junior high his father scraped together the 90 tuition a small fortune to let him stay on as otis s youngest student he studied there for at least five years simultaneously working as the school janitor before graduating in the 1930s not long afterward his father died leaving young mr wong entirely on his own from 1936 to 1938 mr wong was an artist for the works progress administration creating paintings for libraries and other public spaces with friends including the artist benji okubo he founded the oriental artists group of los angeles which organized exhibitions of members work an level of exposure for asian artists at the time mr wong newly married and needing steady work joined disney in 1938 as an creating the thousands of intermediate drawings that bring animated sequences to life asians were then a novelty at hollywood studios and mr wong was made keenly aware of the fact first at disney and later at warner brothers one flung a racial epithet at him another assumed on sight that he worked in the company cafeteria then there was the affront of the s job itself painstaking repetitive and for mr wong quickly it is the work of animation a terrible use of his talents as a landscape artist and a painter mr canemaker said a reprieve came in the late 1930s when mr wong learned that disney was adapting bambi a life in the woods the 1923 novel by the austrian writer felix salten about a fawn whose mother is killed by a hunter in trying to animate the book disney had reached an impasse the studio had enjoyed great success in 1937 with its animated film snow white and the seven dwarfs a baroque production in which every detail of the backgrounds every petal on every flower every leaf on every tree was meticulously represented in an attempt to use a similar style for bambi it found that the ornate backgrounds camouflaged the deer and other forest creatures on which the narrative centered mr wong spied his chance i said gee this is all outdoor scenery he recalled in a video interview years afterward adding i said gee i m a landscape painter invoking the exquisite landscape paintings of the song dynasty a d 960 1279 he rendered in watercolors and pastels a series of nature scenes that were moody lyrical and atmospheric at once lush and spare with backgrounds subtly suggested by a stroke or two of the brush walt disney went crazy over them said mr canemaker who wrote about mr wong in his book before the animation begins the art and lives of disney inspirational sketch artists 1996 he said i love this indefinite quality the mysterious quality of the forest mr wong was unofficially promoted to the rank of inspirational sketch artist but he was more than that mr canemaker explained he was the designer he was the person they went to when they had questions about the color about how to lay something out he even influenced the music and the special effects just by the look of the drawings he inspired people mr wong spent two years painting the illustrations that would inform every aspect of bambi throughout the finished film lent a brooding quality by its stark landscapes misty desaturated palette and figures often seen in silhouette his influence is unmistakable but in 1941 in the wake of a bitter employees strike that year disney fired mr wong though he had chosen not to strike he felt the studio had been good to him mr canemaker said he was let go amid the lingering climate of resentments on bambi mr wong s name appears quite far down in the credits as a mere background artist mr wong joined warner brothers in 1942 working there and lent out on occasion to other studios until his retirement in 1968 the indignities he endured were not confined to the studios trying to buy a house he and his wife the former ruth kim were told that each property they inquired about had just been sold then in a month you d go back there and the sign was still there mr wong recalled in tyrus after the japanese attack on pearl harbor in december 1941 mr wong like many took to wearing a lapel button proclaiming his heritage lest an angry american beat him up on the street the war permanently dispersed the fledgling oriental artists group mr wong s friend mr okubo was sent with tens of thousands of other to an internment camp if world war ii hadn t happened when it did i think these artists even the artists would have more of a name than they do today ms see said and that s because this little movement that had just barely started was split apart by the war mr wong who became a united states citizen in 1946 also designed christmas cards for hallmark and painted elegant

       " 'danny cahill stood slightly dazed in a blizzard of confetti as the audience screamed and his family ran on stage he had won season 8 of nbc s reality television show the biggest loser shedding more weight than anyone ever had on the program an astonishing 239 pounds in seven months when he got on the scale for all to see that evening dec 8 2009 he weighed just 191 pounds down from 430 dressed in a and shorts he was lean athletic and as handsome as a model i ve got my life back he declared i mean i feel like a million bucks mr cahill left the show s stage in hollywood and flew directly to new york to start a triumphal tour of the talk shows chatting with jay leno regis philbin and joy behar as he heard from fans all over the world his elation knew no bounds but in the years since more than 100 pounds have crept back onto his frame despite his best efforts in fact most of that season s 16 contestants have regained much if not all the weight they lost so arduously some are even heavier now yet their experiences while a bitter personal disappointment have been a gift to science a study of season 8 s contestants has yielded surprising new discoveries about the physiology of obesity that help explain why so many people struggle unsuccessfully to keep off the weight they lose kevin hall a scientist at a federal research center who admits to a weakness for reality tv had the idea to follow the biggest loser contestants for six years after that victorious night the project was the first to measure what happened to people over as long as six years after they had lost large amounts of weight with intensive dieting and exercise the results the researchers said were stunning they showed just how hard the body fights back against weight loss it is frightening and amazing said dr hall an expert on metabolism at the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases which is part of the national institutes of health i am just blown away it has to do with resting metabolism which determines how many calories a person burns when at rest when the show began the contestants though hugely overweight had normal metabolisms for their size meaning they were burning a normal number of calories for people of their weight when it ended their metabolisms had slowed radically and their bodies were not burning enough calories to maintain their thinner sizes researchers knew that just about anyone who deliberately loses weight even if they start at a normal weight or even underweight will have a slower metabolism when the diet ends so they were not surprised to see that the biggest loser contestants had slow metabolisms when the show ended what shocked the researchers was what happened next as the years went by and the numbers on the scale climbed the contestants metabolisms did not recover they became even slower and the pounds kept piling on it was as if their bodies were intensifying their effort to pull the contestants back to their original weight mr cahill was one of the worst off as he regained more than 100 pounds his metabolism slowed so much that just to maintain his current weight of 295 pounds he now has to eat 800 calories a day less than a typical man his size anything more turns to fat the struggles the contestants went through help explain why it has been so hard to make headway against the nation s obesity problem which afflicts more than a third of american adults despite spending billions of dollars on drugs and dieting programs even the most motivated are working against their own biology their experience shows that the body will fight back for years and that said dr michael schwartz an obesity and diabetes researcher who is a professor of medicine at the university of washington is new and important the key point is that you can be on tv you can lose enormous amounts of weight you can go on for six years but you can t get away from a basic biological reality said dr schwartz who was not involved in the study as long as you are below your initial weight your body is going to try to get you back the show s doctor robert huizenga says he expected the contestants metabolic rates to fall just after the show but was hoping for a smaller drop he questioned though whether the measurements six years later were accurate but maintaining weight loss is difficult he said which is why he tells contestants that they should exercise at least nine hours a week and monitor their diets to keep the weight off unfortunately many contestants are unable to find or afford adequate ongoing support with exercise doctors psychologists sleep specialists and trainers and that s something we all need to work hard to change he said in an email the study s findings to be published on monday in the journal obesity are part of a scientific push to answer some of the most fundamental questions about obesity researchers are figuring out why being fat makes so many people develop diabetes and other medical conditions and they are searching for new ways to block the poison in fat they are starting to unravel the reasons bariatric surgery allows most people to lose significant amounts of weight when dieting so often fails and they are looking afresh at medical care for obese people the hope is that this work will eventually lead to new therapies that treat obesity as a chronic disease and can help keep weight under control for life most people who have tried to lose weight know how hard it is to keep the weight off but many blame themselves when the pounds come back but what obesity research has consistently shown is that dieters are at the mercy of their own bodies which muster hormones and an altered metabolic rate to pull them back to their old weights whether that is hundreds of pounds more or that extra 10 or 15 that many people are trying to keep off there is always a weight a person s body maintains without any effort and while it is not known why that weight can change over the years it may be an effect of aging at any point there is a weight that is easy to maintain and that is the weight the body fights to defend finding a way to thwart these mechanisms is the goal scientists are striving for first though they are trying to understand them in greater detail dr david ludwig the director of the new balance foundation obesity prevention center at boston children s hospital who was not involved in the research said the findings showed the need for new approaches to weight control he cautioned that the study was limited by its small size and the lack of a control group of obese people who did not lose weight but he added the findings made sense this is a subset of the most successful dieters he said if they don t show a return to normal in metabolism what hope is there for the rest of us still he added that shouldn t be interpreted to mean we are doomed to battle our biology or remain fat it means we need to explore other approaches some scientists say weight maintenance has to be treated as an issue separate from weight loss only when that challenge is solved they say can progress truly be made against obesity there is a lot of basic research we still need to do said dr margaret jackson who is directing a project at pfizer her group is testing a drug that in animals at least acts like leptin a hormone that controls hunger with weight loss leptin levels fall and people become hungry the idea is to trick the brains of people who have lost weight so they do not become ravenous for lack of leptin while many of the contestants kept enough weight off to improve their health and became more physically active the low weights they strived to keep eluded all but one of them erinn egbert a caregiver for her mother in versailles ky and she struggles mightily to keep the pounds off because her metabolism burns 552 fewer calories a day than would be expected for someone her size what people don t understand is that a treat is like a drug said ms egbert who went from 263 pounds to just under 176 on the show and now weighs between 152 and 157 two treats can turn into a binge over a period that is what i struggle with six years after season 8 ended 14 of the 16 contestants went to the n i h last fall for three days of testing the researchers were concerned that the contestants might try to frantically lose

went from 444 pounds to 289 as a contestant on the show now his weight is up to 450 again and he is burning 458 fewer calories a day than would be expected for a man his size it s kind of like hearing you have a life sentence he said slower metabolisms were not the only reason the contestants regained weight though they constantly battled hunger cravings and binges the investigators found at least one reason plummeting levels of leptin the contestants started out with normal levels of leptin by the season s finale they had almost no leptin at all which would have made them ravenous all the time as their weight returned their leptin levels drifted up again but only to about half of what they had been when the season began the researchers found thus helping to explain their urges to eat leptin is just one of a cluster of hormones that control hunger and although dr hall and his colleagues did not measure the rest of them another group of researchers in a different project did in a study funded by australia s national health and medical research council dr joseph proietto of the university of melbourne and his colleagues recruited 50 overweight people who agreed to consume just 550 calories a day for eight or nine weeks they lost an average of nearly 30 pounds but over the next year the pounds started coming back dr proietto and his colleagues looked at leptin and four other hormones that satiate people levels of most of them fell in their study subjects they also looked at a hormone that makes people want to eat its level rose what was surprising was what a coordinated effect it is dr proietto said the body puts multiple mechanisms in place to get you back to your weight the only way to maintain weight loss is to be hungry all the time we desperately need agents that will suppress hunger and that are safe with use mr cahill 46 said his weight problem began when he was in the third grade he got fat then fatter he would starve himself and then eat a whole can of cake frosting with a spoon afterward he would cower in the pantry off the kitchen feeling overwhelmed with shame over the years his insatiable urge to eat kept overcoming him and his weight climbed 370 pounds 400 460 485 i used to look at myself and think i am horrible i am a monster subhuman he said he began sleeping in a recliner because he was too heavy to sleep lying down walking hurt stairs were agony buying clothes with a 68 waist was humiliating i remember sitting in a dressing room one day and nothing would fit i looked at the traffic outside on the street and thought i should just run out in front of a car he eventually seized on the biggest loser as his best chance to lose enough weight to live a normal life he tried three times and was finally selected before the show began the contestants underwent medical tests to be sure they could endure the rigorous schedule that lay ahead and rigorous it was sequestered on the biggest loser ranch with the other contestants mr cahill exercised seven hours a day burning 8 000 to 9 000 calories according to a calorie tracker the show gave him he took electrolyte tablets to help replace the salts he lost through sweating consuming many fewer calories than before eventually he and the others were sent home for four months to try to keep losing weight on their own mr cahill set a goal of a deficit per day the idea was to lose a pound a day he quit his job as a land surveyor to do it his routine went like this wake up at 5 a m and run on a treadmill for 45 minutes have breakfast typically one egg and two egg whites half a grapefruit and a piece of sprouted grain toast run on the treadmill for another 45 minutes rest for 40 minutes bike ride nine miles to a gym work out for two and a half hours shower ride home eat lunch typically a grilled skinless chicken breast a cup of broccoli and 10 spears of asparagus rest for an hour drive to the gym for another round of exercise if he had not burned enough calories to hit his goal he went back to the gym after dinner to work out some more at times he found himself running around his neighborhood in the dark until his indicator reset to zero at midnight on the day of the on the show s finale mr cahill and the others dressed carefully to hide the rolls of loose skin that remained to their surprise and horror after they had lost weight they wore compression undergarments to hold it in mr cahill knew he could not maintain his finale weight of 191 pounds he was so mentally and physically exhausted he barely moved for two weeks after his publicity tour ended but he had started a new career giving motivational speeches as the biggest loser ever and for the next four years he managed to keep his weight below 255 pounds by exercising two to three hours a day but two years ago he went back to his job as a surveyor and the pounds started coming back soon the scale hit 265 mr cahill started weighing and measuring his food again and stepped up his exercise he got back down to 235 to 240 pounds but his weight edged up again to 275 then 295 his slow metabolism is part of the problem and so are his food cravings he opens a bag of chips thinking he will have just a few i d eat five bites then i d black out and eat the whole bag of chips and say what did i do dr lee kaplan an obesity researcher at harvard says the brain sets the number of calories we consume and it can be easy for people to miss that how much they eat matters less than the fact that their bodies want to hold on to more of those calories dr michael rosenbaum an obesity researcher at columbia university who has collaborated with dr hall in previous studies said the body s systems for regulating how many calories are consumed and how many are burned are tightly coupled when people are not strenuously trying to lose weight or to maintain a significant weight loss still pounds can insidiously creep on we eat about 900 000 to a million calories a year and burn them all except those annoying 3 000 to 5 000 calories that result in an average annual weight gain of about one to two pounds he said these very small differences between intake and output average out to only about 10 to 20 calories per day less than one starburst candy but the cumulative consequences over time can be devastating it is not clear whether this small imbalance and the resultant weight gain that most of us experience as we age are the consequences of changes in lifestyle the environment or just the biology of aging dr rosenbaum added the effects of small imbalances between calories eaten and calories burned are more pronounced when people deliberately lose weight dr hall said yes there are signals to regain weight but he wondered how many extra calories people were driven to eat he found a way to figure that out he analyzed data from a clinical trial in which people took a diabetes drug canagliflozin that makes them spill 360 calories a day into their urine or took a placebo the drug has no known effect on the brain and the person does not realize those calories are being spilled those taking the drug gradually lost weight but for every five pounds they lost they were without realizing it eating an additional 200 calories a day those extra calories dr hall said were a bigger driver of weight regained than the slowing of the metabolism and he added if people fought the urge to eat those calories they would be hungry unless they continue to fight it constantly they will regain the weight he said all this does not mean that modest weight loss is hopeless experts say individuals respond differently to diet manipulations or diets for example and to exercise and drugs among other interventions but dr ludwig said that simply cutting calories was not the answer there are no doubt exceptional individuals who can ignore primal biological signals and maintain weight loss for the long term by restricting calories he said but he added that for most people the combination of incessant hunger and slowing metabolism is a recipe for weight regain explaining why so few individuals can maintain weight loss for more than a few months dr rosenbaum agreed the difficulty in keeping weight off reflects biology not a pathological lack of willpower affecting of the u s a he said mr cahill knows that now and with his report from dr hall s group showing just how much his metabolism had slowed he stopped blaming himself for his weight gain that shame that was on my shoulders went off he said ',\n",

the man who became her husband it was these days the version sung by nico the german made famous by andy warhol and the velvet underground actually the song had been playing just before she met jonathan leahy now 38 on that december night in 2011 at the 4100 bar in the silver lake district of los angeles ms kerr can t remember exactly what was playing when they met because at that moment she was jumping up and down like tigger as she put it in answering the usual questions mr leahy told her he was a music supervisor for girls the hbo show created by and starring lena dunham that was enough to get ms kerr bouncing your music has changed my life she told mr leahy mr leahy who is quiet but not shy at least he doesn t jump up and down upon meeting people was mesmerized my main reaction he said was it s a lot easier to talk to beautiful women in a bar when you re working on a hit show they exchanged email addresses more an act of politeness than promise then their soundtrack went quiet for almost a year both mr leahy and ms kerr had active social lives but they were focused on their careers mr leahy who grew up in laconia n h graduated from the college of william and mary in williamsburg va in 2000 and landed in los angeles later that year now he is a music supervisor with aperture music and is joined by manish raval and tom wolfe in being responsible for the music on girls the team has also worked on films including trainwreck and television series such as new girl in addition mr leahy is the music supervisor for survivor s remorse on starz ms kerr grew up in the la jolla section of san diego graduated from the university of southern california in 2000 and eventually made her way to new york where she took a job as an assistant at elle magazine in 2005 she moved back to the west coast to los angeles and with a fellow elle alum katherine power created a company best known for its website who what wear which casts an eye on celebrity culture and fashion it now has 13 million monthly unique visitors ms kerr and ms power also started the who what wear clothing and accessories line sold at target it was nine months after their initial meeting that mr leahy emailed ms kerr he had a friend who wanted to get into the fashion industry ms kerr mr leahy and his friend met for a long boozy brunch they began to email and text a bit there was banter ms kerr said but neither knew the interest or intention of the other a few months later she texted to ask if he could help her score a ticket to see the band lord huron mr leahy happens to be a friend of ben schneider the band s lead singer and had an extra ticket this was one of those moments where the universe conspires to make you seem cooler than you actually are mr leahy said he and ms kerr met up at the show that is when mr leahy and ms kerr moved into the ambiguous mixtape era in which for months they emailed and texted each other with coy are we just friends or what texts revolving around music for example ms kerr was visiting new york and texted mr leahy a request for walking around soho music he sent her a link to love me again by john newman it has a club vibe but romantic lyrics i wanted to read into it ms kerr said but she figured correctly it turns out that her new friend was a bit of a clueless guy who didn t spend much time thinking about how a woman might react to such a song being shared with her another time he emailed her a link to a fleetwood mac version of need your love so bad after listening to it ms kerr said i called my friend katie at that time she continued i just referred to him as the supervisor she knew i had a crush on him she said how can it not mean something mr leahy acknowledged that it might be difficult for a person to think he was not sending ms kerr a message with this song i sort of thought maybe it s too much but he shared it with her anyway this is the same man who sent her the song bedbedbedbedbed vacationer remix by deleted scenes during the friend phase ms kerr said ms kerr played the game too she made mr leahy a mix cd handwritten liner notes and all that she titled feynman diagrams for all after mr leahy told her in a text conversation that he thought the idea of feynman diagrams in which physicists map out the interactions of subatomic particles was romantic on the mix ms kerr included the mazzy star song i ve been let down it was a bit of an easter egg of my actual feelings she said around this time ms kerr texted mr leahy a photo of the drink menu from a bar the roger room she had focused on a drink named for the song christmas card from a hooker in minneapolis which happens to be mr leahy s favorite tom waits tune this made me rethink things a bit he said adding hillary kerr was clearly not to be trifled with in early 2014 mr leahy invited her to a bleachers concert the band s lead singer is jack antonoff who is ms dunham s boyfriend ms dunham was at the concert as well and on meeting ms kerr she said i ve heard so much about you ms kerr and mr leahy shared their first kiss that night he proposed to her on polihale beach in kauai hawaii on jan 1 2016 on dec 10 125 friends and relatives gathered in palm

       " 'with donald j trump about to take control of the white house it would seem a dark time for the renewable energy industry after all mr trump has mocked the science of global warming as a chinese hoax threatened to kill a global deal on climate change and promised to restore the coal industry to its former glory so consider what happened in the middle of december after investors had had a month to absorb the implications of mr trump s victory the federal government opened bidding on a tract of the ocean floor off new york state as a potential site for a huge wind farm up up and away soared the offers interest from the bidders was so fevered that the auction went through 33 rounds and spilled over to a second day in the end the winning bidder offered the federal treasury 42 million more than twice what the government got in august for oil leases oil leases in the gulf of mexico who won the bid none other than statoil the norwegian oil company which is in the midst of a major campaign to turn itself into a big player in renewable energy we do not know for sure that the new york wind farm will get built but we do know this the energy transition is real and mr trump is not going to stop it on a global scale more than half the investment in new electricity generation is going into renewable energy that is more than 300 billion a year a sign of how powerful the momentum has become wind power is booming in the united states with the industry adding manufacturing jobs in the reddest states when mr trump s appointees examine the facts they will learn that technician is projected to be the occupation in america over the next decade the election of mr trump left climate activists and environmental groups in despair they had pinned their hopes on a hillary clinton victory and a continuation of president obama s strong push to tackle global warming now of course everything is in flux in the worst case with a sufficiently pliant congress mr trump could roll back a decade of progress on climate change barring some miraculous conversion on mr trump s part his election cannot be interpreted as anything but bad news for the climate agenda yet despair might be an overreaction for starters when mr trump gets to the white house he will find that the federal government actually has relatively little control over american energy policy and particularly over electricity generation the coal industry has been ravaged in part by cheap natural gas which is abundant because of technological changes in the way it is produced and there is no lever in the oval office that mr trump can pull to reverse that the intrinsically weak federal role was a source of frustration for mr obama and his aides but now it will work to the benefit of environmental advocates they have already persuaded more than half the states to adopt mandates on renewable energy efforts to roll those back have largely failed with the latest development coming only last week when gov john kasich of ohio a republican vetoed a rollback bill the federal government does offer important subsidies for renewable energy and they will surely become a target in the new congress but those subsidies are already scheduled to fall drastically over five years in a deal cut a year ago that gave the oil industry some favors and that passed congress with many republican votes if mr trump pushes for an early end to the subsidies he will find that renewable energy has friends in the republican party topping that list is charles e grassley the senior senator from iowa that state in presidential politics let us remember will soon be getting 40 percent of its electricity from wind power senator grassley has been and continues to be an extraordinary leader and champion for the wind industry said tom kiernan the head of the american wind energy association a trade group when i spoke with him last week mr kiernan did not sound like a man gnashing his teeth about the impending trump era by his group s calculations 80 billion of wind industry investment is in the pipeline for the united states over the next few years we are creating jobs throughout america jobs and we think trump will want that to continue he said if mr trump really wanted to roll back the clock he could try to get congress to override all the state mandates a gross violation of the supposed conservative commitment to federalism but it would be a titanic fight some republican senators would defect on principle and mr trump would almost certainly lose so if the damage mr trump can do domestically is limited by circumstance what about the international effort against global warming that is the prospect that has david g victor most worried dr victor a professor at the university of california at san diego is one of the closest observers of global climate politics while the nations of the world agreed a year ago to a landmark deal to tackle global warming that consensus is fragile he pointed out the paris agreement is really an outline more promise than reality mr trump has vowed to withdraw right now other countries are saying they will go forward even if he does so but it is not hard to imagine the thing unraveling as part of the negotiations the obama administration promised billions of dollars from american taxpayers to help poor countries adjust to the devastation of global warming that s a big part of the glue that held the paris deal together dr victor pointed out mr trump is considered likely to abandon that pledge perhaps the biggest threat to the climate agenda posed by the incoming administration is not anything that mr trump might do but rather what he will not do while the energy transition is real it is still in its earliest stages iowa may soon get 40 percent of its power from wind but for the united states as a whole the figure is closer to 5 percent the transition is simply not happening fast enough the pledges countries made in paris even if kept are not ambitious enough to meet the climate goals embodied in the paris agreement the world needed an american president who would have pushed hard to accelerate the energy transition you can debate whether mrs clinton would have been that president but it is certainly clear that mr trump will not be so as washington goes into reverse gear on climate policy seas will keep rising and heat waves will get worse later this month global monitoring agencies are expected to report that 2016 was the hottest year in the historical record beating out 2015 which beat out 2014 if nothing else the next four years may be a fascinating test of just how far politics can become divorced from physical reality ',\n",
       " 'thompsons tex can one of the most promising and troubled technologies for fighting global warming survive during the administration of donald j trump the technology carbon capture involves pulling carbon dioxide out of smokestacks and industrial processes before the gas can make its way into the atmosphere mr trump s denial of the overwhelming scientific evidence supporting climate change a view shared by many of his cabinet nominees might appear to doom any such environmental initiatives but the new petra nova plant about to start running here about 30 miles southwest of houston is a bright spot for the technology s supporters it is being completed essentially on time and within its budget unlike many previous such projects when it fires up the plant which is attached to one of the power company nrg s hulking units will draw 90 percent of the co2 from the emissions produced by 240 megawatts of generated power that is a fraction of the roughly 3 700 megawatts produced at this gargantuan plant the largest in the lone star state still it is enough to capture 1 6 million tons of carbon dioxide each year equivalent to the greenhouse gas produced by driving 3 5 billion miles or the co2 from generating electricity for 214 338 homes from a tower hundreds of feet above the petra nova operation the carbon capture system looks like a fever dream of an erector set fanatic with mazes of pipes and gleaming tanks set off from the main plant s skyscraping smokestacks and busy coal conveyors petra nova uses the most common technology for carbon capture the exhaust stream pushed down a snaking conduit to the petra nova equipment is exposed to a solution of chemicals known as amines which bond with the carbon dioxide that solution is pumped to a regenerator or stripper which heats the amine and releases the co2 the gas is drawn off and compressed for further use and the amine solution is then cycled back through the system to absorb more co2 petra nova a joint venture of nrg and jx nippon oil and gas exploration will not just grab the co2 it will use it pushing compressed co2 through a new pipeline 81 miles to an oil field the gas will be injected into wells a technique known as enhanced oil recovery that should increase production to 15 000 barrels a day from about 300 barrels a day and since nrg owns a quarter of the oil recovery project what comes out of the ground will help pay for the carbon capture operation the plant which has received 190 million from the federal government can be economically viable if the price of oil is about 50 a barrel said david knox an nrg spokesman the company expects to declare the plant operational in january mr knox said aware of problems with carbon capture projects around the country and of the risks of hubris he said we re not going to declare victory before it s time if the price of oil stabilizes or rises and if tax breaks for developing the technology continue and markets for carbon storage develop he said utilities might ask why would i not want to put a carbon capture system on my plant but developing carbon capture has been neither straightforward nor easy so far problems have bedeviled major projects often costing far more than projected and taking longer to complete the federal government has canceled projects like future gen which was granted more than 1 billion by the obama administration carbon capture systems are not just expensive to build they tend to be and make the plant less efficient over all a problem known as parasitic load the petra nova carbon capture process gets its energy from a separate power plant constructed for the purpose which nrg says makes the system more efficient than it would otherwise be and frees up all of the capacity of the main power plant to sell all of the electricity it produces the company estimates that the next plant it builds could cost 20 percent less thanks to lessons learned this time around if petra nova succeeds it means a boost for carbon capture despite carbon capture s problems its supporters including the intergovernmental panel on climate change and the international energy agency call the technology known as carbon capture sequestration crucial for meeting emissions standards that can prevent the worst effects of climate change if you don t have c c s the chance of success goes down and the cost of success goes up said julio friedmann an expert at the lawrence livermore laboratories in california and a former energy department official if you do have c c s the chance of success goes up and the cost of success goes down carbon capture is proving itself said david mohler the deputy assistant secretary for clean coal and carbon management at the federal energy department developing technologies often involves delay and cost overruns initially he said you cannot engineer all the bugs out from inside a cubicle you really have to do this stuff in the real world he said driving down costs he noted is what engineers and businesses do through research development and production he cited the plummeting cost of initially expensive technologies like solar power we do figure things out as we go he said what the trump administration will do with carbon capture is at this point anyone s guess the technology only makes sense in a world where you are seeking to avoid putting co2 into the atmosphere said mark brownstein a vice president for the climate and energy program at the environmental defense fund but some supporters of the technology see reasons for hope i actually think it s a moment of optimism said senator heidi heitkamp of north dakota who met with mr trump last month as a potential agriculture secretary ms heitkamp legislation with another democrat senator sheldon whitehouse of rhode island to expand and extend tax breaks for carbon capture projects what i saw with the was a laserlike focus on jobs she said i think he was intrigued about the economic opportunity that carbon capture could provide to keep coal power generation in the national mix she added one of the pillars of mr trump s campaign was his intention to revive the fortunes of the coal industry through support of clean coal and while the exact meaning of the phrase is open to interpretation it generally includes not just technologies that remove soot and pollutants but also carbon dioxide ms heitkamp said that businesses too were likely to continue development of carbon capture technology since they planned their plant investments on a curve of decades and are loath to change course because of a single election the decision they are making is not what does the political outlook look like today what s it look like over the life of this plant although she concedes that a revival of coal s fortunes is unlikely carbon capture could be a way to extend the life of current facilities while keeping the nation s energy mix diverse jeff erikson general manager at the global c c s institute which promotes the technology said he did not expect to see a great number of new coal plants on the way i wouldn t say carbon capture is going to rescue the coal industry he said but pointed out that there is great potential for applying carbon capture to diverse natural gas plants and to industrial applications captured carbon can be used not just for oil production but a widening range of industrial processes or can even be pumped into the ground one of the most innovative approaches to carbon capture is being tried 50 miles east of the petra nova plant in la porte tex where a consortium of companies is trying an entirely new approach to power generation in a 140 million 50 megawatt demonstration project the company net power will use superheated carbon dioxide in much the same way that conventional power plants use steam to drive turbines this system invented by a british engineer rodney allam eliminates the inefficiency inherent in heating water into steam and cooling it again the power plant produces a stream of very pure pressurized carbon dioxide that is ready for pipelines without much of the additional processing that conventional carbon capture systems require the creators say that their technology will produce electric power at a price comparable to power plants the efficient plants that burn gas to power one turbine and then use the excess heat from that process to generate additional power with a steam turbine that means in effect that the cost of being green is zero said bill brown the chief executive of net power the potential to capture co2 at no additional cost would be a game changer said fatima maria ahmad a fellow at the center for climate and energy solutions a think tank net power combines the resources of exelon generation a power company the engineering and construction firm cbi and 8 rivers capital which developed the technology used in the project the centerpiece of the project is a special turbine built by toshiba and designed for the punishingly high pressure used in the process and while any system that so closely resembles a rocket engine has the potential for what engineers delicately refer to as a rud rapid unplanned disassembly those working directly on the project say they have designed safety features that give them confidence even if the united states government shows little interest in reducing the nation s carbon footprint under mr trump and a republican congress consortium officials say they expect to find ready customers from companies in the united states and around the globe where the threat of climate change is fully acknowledged we see this very much playing into all parts of the world said daniel mccarthy executive vice president for cbi s technology operating group environmentalists remain divided on the issue of carbon capture said john coequyt global climate policy director for sierra club this is the issue where the biggest range of positions exists within the environmental community he said groups like the clean air task force favor it strongly other factions call clean coal a fig leaf to keep coal with all of its environmental baggage in the energy mix and many suggest the billions of dollars spent on trying to capture carbon would be better directed to the technologies that don t pollute the atmosphere in the first place dr friedmann the former energy official predicted that the technology would prove its usefulness it s convenient to just say keep it in the ground he said referring to an slogan what i prefer to say is keep it from the air

has taken frequent vacations in hawaii staying at a private home but mr trump s private club in florida where he has spent the past two weeks away from his home in new york city is likely to eclipse them all as the 45th president s winter white house and that was always the intention of marjorie meriweather post the cereal heiress and the property s original owner who left to the federal government when she died in 1973 hoping it would serve as a home for presidents but the government had no interest in her plan and mr trump later bought the property for less than 10 million turning it into a club where membership costs six figures mr trump s arrival was greeted with sneers by the palm beach elite and he opened up s membership to jews and who had been excluded from other establishments he was also the first club owner on the island to admit an openly gay couple since mr trump s victory in november has been stuffed with guests attracted by an amenity unique to this club the chance to rub shoulders with the next president it s like going to disneyland and knowing mickey mouse will be there all day long said jeff greene a developer and unsuccessful democratic candidate for the senate from florida in 2010 who is a member and was a hillary clinton supporter instead of hosting major corporate executives and potential cabinet secretaries for interviews inside a boxy transition office at trump tower in midtown manhattan mr trump has been seated at an ornately designed couch upholstered in pale fabric laced with gold beneath a chandelier hanging from the ceiling a scene resembling a mansion in sunset boulevard or citizen kane two of mr trump s favorite movies at night the couches are moved out and tables are added to accommodate the evening cocktail crowd among whom mr trump moves from one table to the next the most powerful greeter in the world at the annual new year s eve party on saturday night a white menu included mr trump s wedge salad a wild mushroom and swiss chard ravioli and a breakfast buffet those in attendance drifted in under a striped awning the men dressed in tuxedos the women in ball gowns many with their hair swept high guests stepped onto a red carpet as they entered the club and wandered over to a poolside cocktail party mr trump later delivered remarks according to a guest who said he thanked his family and the club members for their support over the years howie carr a conservative radio host who was supportive of mr trump roamed the crowd with mr carr posting on twitter that his daughter asked mr trump if she could be an intern in the white house mr trump s two adult sons eric and donald jr posed for photographs joe scarborough and mika brzezinski from msnbc s morning joe were also there like most aspects of mr trump s business interests the party generated controversy as tickets to it were made available to club members and guests for a little more than 500 mr trump s aides rejected the questions mr trump returned to new york on sunday night but the club will remain an escape for him his contentious twitter posts belie his relative calm when he is at compared with when he is isolated inside trump tower mr trump s combative public persona often on display during his campaign mostly dissolves behind the walls of his castle is an environment he can control said the historian douglas brinkley who last week attended a lunch with a longtime club member chris ruddy the chief executive of newsmax media i watched him hold court he was so comfortable in his own skin and so relaxed mr ruddy has hosted mr carr and laura ingraham another conservative radio host who supported mr trump at the club and has introduced mr trump to a range of news media figures politicians and donors he described the as seeking the donald trump totally at ease very positive very gregarious mr trump appears to feed off contact with the people at the club over the thanksgiving holiday he queried dinner guests about whether he should appoint rudolph w giuliani or mitt romney as his secretary of state he ended up picking neither during this trip he has heaped praise on his ultimate choice for the job rex w tillerson the head of exxon mobil mr trump has called him mr exxon he talks about the work he has done to find a solution for the problems at the department of veteran affairs which included a recent meeting with a number of executives at mr trump told a new york times reporter that he intended to make brian burns the businessman son of a confidante of joseph p kennedy the ambassador to ireland isaac perlmutter the reclusive head of marvel entertainment is a member who helped mr trump put that meeting together mr trump has also held with robert k kraft the owner of the new england patriots and a club member and hosted prominent figures like carlos slim the billionaire who is mexico s richest man mr trump his wife melania and their son barron inhabit a residential area of the club his adult children and their families usually stay in nearby cabanas on the property mr trump frequently dines on the patio a central point of action where at night a singer plays with a small band sometimes belting out requests from mr trump and other guests my way a song popularized by frank sinatra was one recent choice a violinist sometimes moves among tables plucking tunes like the theme from fiddler on the roof mr trump has given the cadre of white house reporters who now cover him some access to the club but grudgingly so he once again eluded the reporters covering him on saturday slipping away without any warning to play golf at another of his clubs nearby in jupiter and outside the confines of old grievances flare up on the golf course mr trump spotted harry hurt a biographer who wrote critically of mr trump years ago preparing to play a round with david h koch a billionaire conservative donor mr trump ordered club officials to remove mr hurt from the property according to a facebook post by mr hurt over the years mr trump has also been perpetually at loggerheads with palm beach officials he has filed lawsuits attempting to keep noisy planes from flying over and there have been disputes over the height of his oversize flagpole on the grounds with its owner s coming new job the club has had some changes guests now go through an elaborate security screen to gain access to the main entrance secret service agents are now sprinkled throughout the property at night blending into the shrubbery along the grounds robin bernstein a club member for nearly 25 years said that some club members might express frustration but that most thought it was important that we keep donald and his family safe attendees seem to see a benefit so far in having the around and expect it will continue the loser in this game is camp david said mr brinkley referring to the longtime presidential retreat in maryland once you re at and it s so opulent and the idea of suddenly inserting yourself into camp david s maryland mountains environment seems unlikely ',\n",

       " 'it s the season for family travel and photos and perhaps enlarging some of those images of snowy landscapes or tropical getaways to decorate your home there are of course the usual print services and methods you can choose a glossy or matte finish print a photo on canvas or make it into a poster with a few clicks online at photo sites like snapfish and shutterfly professional photo shops like adorama and mpix or drugstores and chains like walgreens and costco but the web is also home to many printing services as well as uncommon surfaces on which to enlarge photos for display be it burlap wood boards acrylic or fabric why not try some fresh sites and methods i recently sent some quality iphone vacation photos to a handful of companies that i d never used before and had them enlarged to various sizes and printed on different surfaces i ve also offered some guidance about bulk digitizing those boxes of old travel photos sitting in your closet or basement so that you can begin the new year if not with a vacation then with a home of all the ways to turn photos into wall art i was most interested in trying engineer prints named for the large lightweight prints used by architects for less than the cost of a couple of movie tickets you can make huge enlargements mind you it s a particular aesthetic one that s most likely to appeal to people who are after an industrial shabby chic or bohemian look the paper is thin and the lines of the images are softer than a fine art print and engineer prints need not be formally framed people stick them to their walls with washi tape a crafting tape that comes in innumerable colors and prints or they hang the prints using wood poster rails or skeleton clips for a while engineer prints from photos were primarily available in black and white but now you can find them in color too one of the easiest ways to order them online is through parabo press which is run by photojojo an online photography gear shop and zoomin a photo printing service in asia as with all printing sites you upload your image zoom in closer if you like and then click to buy the site s engineer prints are 4 feet by 3 feet and cost 20 in black and white and 25 in color i sent out two different photos to be made in black and white and they came out to my surprise beautifully i was impressed that they were able to be enlarged to such a degree and not look blurry and the paper while so thin i was worried about accidentally tearing it lends it an artful careless look rather than the expected framed print over the couch parabo press is a breeze to use it s clean and easy to read your options are straightforward and there are no annoying upsells the site also offers prints on metal glass newsprint and zines handmade magazines calendars photo books and prints from its risograph machine which uses ink and is described by parabo as having a cult following since its invention in 1980s japan a fabric print not soft like a bedsheet more like a place mat made of matte woven fabric is another departure from a traditional photo enlargement order one from a site such as snapbox and instead of framing it you can peel and stick it on your wall the site s fabric posters adhere to and can be peeled off smooth surfaces such as untextured walls glass ceilings tile and finished wood surfaces avoid surfaces like stucco concrete blocks brick unfinished wood canvas or freshly painted walls snapbox offers fabric posters in more than a dozen sizes from 4x4 to 36x54 from less than 2 to about 80 i ordered a 24x36 fabric poster for 34 99 a discounted price thanks to a holiday coupon not cheap you can buy fine art prints on other sites for less but you re printing on special material regardless of the cost i expected the finished product to look like the sort of cheap thing one might see in a dorm room it sticks to walls after all but i was pleasantly surprised the fabric was durable and the details in the photo crevasses in a glacier onlookers on a bridge were nicely defined snapbox is a site with clear instructions and pricing in addition to fabric posters it also offers fine art prints photo books and prints on canvas and pillows while many places can print photos on hard surfaces such as metal and acrylic printing on wood boards is less common the grain shows through your photos which thematically speaking seems to make sense for certain subjects like nature photos taken at say the beach or in a park but what would something more modern like a skyscraper or a tower look like on wood i decided to give it a try and put an image of tokyo tower on an 8x12 board 65 i sent the photo to photobarn a family business that makes its products by hand in a in tennessee the result was a lovely departure from framed prints and from canvas which can sometimes make striking photos look like amateur paintings the wood was smooth and thick and the image was crisp with a slight sheen a perfect complement to the steel of tokyo tower and the silver and glass of surrounding skyscrapers for the most part the site is intuitive though a few too many holiday sale buttons on the home page made for a disorienting start photobarn will also print your photos on canvas burlap and other wood products like ornaments i noticed a number of complaints about photobarn on yelp and the better business bureau website regarding shipping speeds and customer service i didn t have a problem but if time is of the essence you may want to check with the company before placing an order once you ve turned the best of your travel photos into art it s time to store the rest if boxes of prints are taking up closet and psychic space there are plenty of sites online that will scan your old photos as well as negatives slides and videos so you can store them digitally but there are several things to keep in mind in general these sites are a pain to navigate they re cluttered with too much text and fine print and they offer so many options do you want your photos scanned in order do you want both sides of the photo scanned that if you don t have a goal in mind before you go in you can quickly be overwhelmed decide ahead of time what exactly you want to scan how many photos you have and how you might use whatever you scan also note that some of these companies by default send dvds or cds of your digital files not everyone has a cd or dvd player if you want a thumb drive instead be sure to select that option if it s offered or call the company and see if it will provide one be aware too that it s not unusual for these companies to have long lead times a number of them digitize your photos in other countries so it can take weeks to get your images back for affordable bulk scans scanmyphotos com is an old standby you can read david pogue s review on nytimes com the company will scan about 1 800 photos at 300 dpi for 145 at its headquarters in irvine calif the cost of sending the photo box to you as well as the shipping of the box to scanmyphotos and back to you again is included in the price that s one of the least costly and most uncomplicated deals around other companies charge for shipping photo boxes i asked a photo editor at the times if 300 dpi is sufficient for scanning and she said that to print photos at larger sizes a higher dpi is preferable scanmyphotos has such an option a prepaid box for 259 for the same number of scans at 600 dpi instead of 300 dpi a thumb drive is an additional 15 95 a box to find the best place to scan photos and film the wirecutter a consumer review site owned by the new york times researched 37 different scanning services and tested the top 12 contenders memories renewed took the number one spot the company based in minneapolis minn offered the best combination of price quality and turnaround time of any service we tested wirecutter said i was planning to try the service however according to the memories renewed site demand is so high at the moment that the lead time for most projects is more than two months scanning photos of any size up to 8 5x11 is 60 cents a photo a thumb drive is 10 for 8 gb or 15 for 16 gb let s say you don t want to ship your irreplaceable photos in the mail or maybe you d rather that strangers not see your photos and home videos you could buy a scanner and scan your photos yourself perhaps doing a batch for half an hour each day personally i don t want machines around my home collecting dust and fast becoming outdated so i decided to try the new photoscan app by google photos it s free and enables users to scan prints with a smartphone first things first these are not scans if you have prized photos in need of restoration then go with a professional however if like me you have a bunch of travel photos landscapes food monuments that you re keeping simply because you want to remember where you were when you may want to consider trying the app instead of giving up some privacy and spending upward of 150 by and large photoscan is simple and quick with almost no learning curve if you try it just make sure to hold your phone level when asked to move it over the image remember these words don t tilt your phone most of the scans i made looked as good as the prints in terms of color and clarity that said this is unlikely to be your solution if you want prints or have thousands of photos to scan once you get the hang of photoscan using it becomes a repetitive vaguely activity that is unless the app crashes which it did several times but i was still glad for it even when it crashed it took only the tap of a finger to begin again and you can t beat the price ',\n",
       " 'finally the second avenue subway opened in new york city on sunday with thousands of riders flooding into its polished stations to witness a piece of history nearly a century in the making they descended beneath the streets of the upper east side of manhattan to board q trains bound for coney island in brooklyn they cheered their eyes filled with tears they snapped selfies in front of colorful mosaics lining the walls of the stations it was the first day of 2017 and it felt like a new day for a city that for so long struggled to build this sorely needed subway line in a rare display of unbridled optimism from hardened new yorkers they arrived with huge grins and wide eyes taking in the bells and whistles at three new stations i was very choked up betsy morris 70 said as she rode the first train to leave the 96th street station at noon how do you explain something that you never thought would happen it s going to change the way everybody lives as far as commuting goes it was a major moment for new york s sprawling transit system after decades of failed efforts to bring the line to one of the few corners of manhattan the subway did not reach the opening of the first segment of the line an extension of the q train to 96th street promises to lighten the crush of passengers on the nos 4 5 and 6 trains along lexington avenue the nation s most overcrowded subway line which had been the only line on the upper east side of manhattan when the stations opened shortly before noon they were quickly filled with giddy riders both young and old and strollers suitcases and dogs all familiar sights across the system but for all the excitement the line with just three new stops is much more modest than the ambitious route running the length of manhattan that was once envisioned it serves a relatively affluent and not very diverse part of the city which has more than eight and a half million people and many and minority residents who live far from a subway line with the subway reaching its highest ridership levels since 1948 much of the aging system is plagued by crowding and delays even as subway and bus fares are expected to rise again in march still there was reason to cheer the opening of a new subway line is a rare occasion in the united states and comes at a time of mounting concern about the deteriorating state of the nation s infrastructure from its roadways and bridges to its public transit systems few new subway stations have opened in recent years even as expansive subway networks have sprouted in asia and most american cities never built any in the first place the major subways in the northeast in new york washington and boston are grappling with old equipment and funding shortfalls with washington experiencing a near meltdown over safety problems with mounting bills for basic maintenance these subways have largely failed to grow so the arrival of the second avenue subway which was first proposed in the 1920s was a notable achievement for the metropolitan transportation authority which runs the city s vast network of subways buses and commuter railroads the first phase of the project took nearly a decade to build and cost about 4 4 billion with the opening the map of the city s loved and loathed subway adds three new stations bringing the total to 472 the most of any subway in the world a station that opened at hudson yards on manhattan s far west side in 2015 was the city s first new station in a on sunday new yorkers were mesmerized by the artwork adorning the walls at the 72nd street stop sumana harihareswara stopped to gaze at a mosaic of a woman of south asian descent dressed in a burgundy sari looking at her cellphone ms harihareswara was overcome with emotion i don t think i ve ever come across subway art before that makes me feel so seen she said through tears this woman could be my aunt she could be my cousin she and a stranger exchanged a knowing glance representation matters they agreed ms harihareswara a longtime transit enthusiast from astoria queens said she was struck by the diversity portrayed in the mosaics including a mural of a gay couple holding hands there is no feeling quite like seeing yourself cemented into the infrastructure of new york ms harihareswara said after decades of aborted efforts to build the second avenue line and at least three groundbreakings in the 1970s construction on the current segment began in 2007 the line was originally projected to open in 2013 but subway officials pushed the deadline to the end of 2016 many years ago gov andrew m cuomo a democrat who effectively controls the authority pressed officials to meet the december 2016 deadline even as concerns grew that the subway would not be ready in time still the agency made the deadline just barely with a lavish inaugural ride on new year s eve for a collection of dignitaries that culminated in a midnight toast although many new yorkers believe the city runs the subways it is actually the governor who appoints the authority s chairman and holds considerable sway over the agency mr cuomo has capitalized on the second avenue opening to raise his national profile overshadowing his frequent nemesis mayor bill de blasio a democrat who attended the inaugural ride on saturday but was not given a speaking slot despite general good will over the opening some transit advocates expressed concerns over the high cost of the project and questioned whether officials would move aggressively to extend the line to 125th street in east harlem as planned on sunday morning mr cuomo arrived at the 96th street station with the authority s chairman thomas f prendergast to join the first trip for regular riders who cheered as the train pulled out of the station then mr cuomo s voice came over the loudspeaker rest assured i m not driving the train he joked the first day of service was smooth although there were a few hiccups around 3 p m there were delays on the q line because of a train with mechanical problems at the city hall station about an hour earlier the elevator at the new 86th street stop had begun to malfunction stranding passengers above and below ground strollers were wheeled onto steep escalators parents became upset jill tallmer 62 and her mother margot tallmer 91 contemplated visiting another day we ve been waiting for 10 years or more to ride the younger ms tallmer said while standing with her mother a lifelong new yorker who is in a wheelchair hopefully it s almost ready for us it was not and they left after a few minutes at the 72nd street station george braith a jazz saxophonist was being mobbed by an eager pack of veritable paparazzi the reason for his newfound celebrity his likeness is featured in a mosaic there would you look at that guy mr braith 77 said pretty handsome fellow if you ask me he is one of several local celebrities portrayed in the artwork including chef daniel boulud in mr braith s mosaic he is clad in a slick red blazer and carrying his signature braithophone alto and soprano saxophones melded into one taking the instrument from his suitcase he obliged the crowd with a brief tune are you famous a asked seeing the hubbub in the jazz world mr braith replied the man shook his head and said well you re immortalized as far as i m concerned another celebrant ian ma 15 lives in sheepshead bay a waterfront neighborhood in southern brooklyn that is nowhere near the new subway line but he has been enchanted by trains since he started rolling toy models on the floor as a child he said and he cajoled his parents into giving him a ride i feel like i ve been waiting for this train my whole life he said seemingly speaking for many others ',\n",
       " ' pages into the journal found in dylann s roof s car after the assertions of black inferiority the lamentations over white powerlessness the longing for a race war comes an incongruous declaration i want state that i am morally opposed to psychology wrote the young white supremacist who would murder nine black worshipers at emanuel a m e church in charleston s c in june 2015 it is a jewish invention and does nothing but invent diseases and tell people they have problems when they dont mr roof who plans to represent himself when the penalty phase of his federal capital trial begins on tuesday apparently is devoted enough to that proposition or delusion as some maintain to stake his life on it although a defense based on his psychological capacity might be his best opportunity to avoid execution he seems steadfastly committed to preventing any public examination of his mental state or background i will not be calling mental health experts or presenting mental health evidence he wrote to judge richard m gergel of federal district court on dec 16 a day after a jury took only two hours to find him guilty of 33 counts including hate crimes resulting in death obstruction of religion and firearms violations at a hearing on wednesday mr roof told the judge that he planned to make an opening statement but not call witnesses or present evidence on his behalf the testimony presented by prosecutors during the guilt phase of mr roof s trial detailed with gruesome precision how he had plotted and executed the massacre during a wednesday night bible study in the church s fellowship hall it was less satisfying in revealing why he had done it with his choice to sideline his legal team and represent himself the second phase when the same jury of nine whites and three blacks will decide whether to sentence him to death or to life in prison may prove little different death penalty experts said it was exceedingly rare for capital defendants to represent themselves after allowing lawyers to handle the initial part of a case mr roof who also faces a death penalty trial in state court has not publicly explained his reasoning but legal filings strongly suggest a split with his defenders about whether to argue that his rampage resulted from mental illness mr roof s lead lawyer david i bruck tried repeatedly to plant that notion during the guilt phase knowing it might be his only chance because evidence of mitigating factors is supposed to be reserved for the penalty phase judge gergel allowed him little leeway in his closing argument while acknowledging mr roof s guilt mr bruck managed to tell the jury that mr roof subscribed to the mad idea that he can make things better by massacring the most virtuous kind and gentle people he could ever have found mr bruck seeded his speech with words like abnormal irrationality senselessness delusional obsession and perseveration a psychiatric term referring to the uncontrollable repetition of a particular response mr bruck one of the country s most experienced death penalty litigators portrayed his client as a loner whose most meaningful relationship seemed to be with his cat who staged hundreds of photographs of himself with no sign of friends whose racial hatred was ignited by internet searches and not personal experience who could not pinpoint during his confession to the f b i how many he had killed how long he had spent at the church or even what month it was who had no escape plan and left suicide notes to his parents there was something in him that made him feel that he had to do it mr bruck said and that is as much as he knows after receiving the results of a psychiatric examination in november judge gergel found mr roof competent to stand trial meaning that he was capable of understanding the proceedings and assisting in his defense at mr bruck s request the judge scheduled a second competency hearing for monday but he signaled last week that he saw no reason to delay the penalty phase the judge has repeatedly warned mr roof against representing himself including immediately after the verdicts when he called it a bad decision and urged him to fully appreciate the implications the warnings have had no discernible effect on mr roof who has until tuesday to reverse his decision to relegate his lawyers to standby counsel that status allows mr bruck and his team to offer guidance but not to question witnesses or make objections prosecutors plan a procession of grief perhaps calling dozens of members of victims families to testify about the impact of the killings the prosecutors are also likely to the considerable evidence of mr roof s premeditation and clearly articulated racial intent death penalty experts said the absence of mental health evidence to mitigate those aggravating factors could be decisive if the jury views roof as evil and having made a knowing intelligent choice to kill these innocent churchgoing people in order to foment racial hatred they are much more likely to impose the death penalty than if they believe him to be a young and severely mentally ill person who acted under delusional racist beliefs said robert dunham executive director of the death penalty information center a research group it would take only one holdout on the jury which consists of 10 women and two men to spare mr roof from lethal injection judge gergel has ruled that the jurors can be told that prosecutors had rejected mr roof s offer through mr bruck to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence many in charleston were relieved by mr roof s conviction in light of the mistrial that had been declared 10 days earlier in the state murder prosecution of michael t slager the white north charleston policeman whose fatal shooting of a black motorist in 2015 was captured on video even those who oppose the death penalty on moral grounds like the rev joseph a darby a presiding elder for the african methodist episcopal church in charleston said it would seem bewildering for mr roof to escape capital punishment that could very well be the end of the death penalty in america because if there was ever justification for killing anybody this is the case mr darby said there is no consensus among members of the victims families about mr roof s fate when the justice department elected in may to seek the death penalty it acted against the wishes of many and of the two women he had spared five relatives offered mr roof a measure of forgiveness at a remarkable bond hearing two days after the shootings but by law those who testify now are prohibited from telling the jury what penalty they think he should receive it s going to be extremely emotional powerful testimony said john h blume a death penalty expert who teaches at cornell law school and that emotion could implicitly and misleadingly indicate to the jury that some of these people want the death penalty when it s not the case if mr roof is sentenced to death it will be the first time a jury has done so in a prosecution involving the federal hate crimes law according to experts on capital cases that statute which was broadened in 2009 does not carry a potential death sentence but mr roof was also convicted of other crimes that do a death sentence most likely would give way to a yearslong series of appeals in which mr roof could not represent himself among the issues could be the composition of the jury given that mr roof acted rather passively as his own lawyer when it was selected the withholding of evidence on mental health and other mitigating factors and mr roof s competence to stand trial and to represent himself in 2008 the supreme court ruled in indiana v edwards that trial judges could insist on legal representation for defendants who are competent enough to stand trial but who suffer from severe mental illness to the point where they are not competent to conduct trial proceedings by themselves mr bruck and his team have argued in court filings that mr roof a dropout has no right to represent himself in a capital trial and even less so at the penalty phase but in the 41 years since the supreme court recognized a sixth amendment right of for criminal defendants in faretta v california the court has never specifically narrowed that holding for death penalty trials despite their complexity some death penalty opponents hope that mr roof s defiance will prompt the appellate courts to adopt a more rigorous standard for capital defendants whether or not they re legally insane there s certainly something mentally wrong with them said peter d greenspun a lawyer who was ousted by a defendant john a muhammad for part of a capital murder trial for the 2002 sniper attacks in the washington area he added to have a person like that make this kind of decision it really calls into question from a philosophical point of view whether that person is in a position to understand their civil liberties mr muhammad who ultimately reinstated mr greenspun was sentenced to death in 2003 and executed six years later it s something that roof will likely regret mr greenspun predicted of his choice to represent himself at some point down the road he s going to say what did i do and there s no going back ',\n",
       " 'mumbai india it was a bold and risky gamble by prime minister narendra modi of india that quickly seemed to backfire the announcement of a ban on the largest currency bills circulating in india which came into full effect at midnight friday the last day for depositing the old notes at banks set off cash shortages that have hit the country s most vulnerable people hard and prompted worries about the economy but despite those concerns as well as doubts about whether the currency ban will reduce corruption as it is designed to do for the moment at least mr modi s bet appears to be paying off in the public arena even as the poorest indians have struggled many have continued to voice support for the prime minister s initiative to target the vast amounts of untaxed money known as black money flowing through the country s economy in hopes that it will combat an endemic culture of corruption mr modi analysts say has successfully tapped into deep frustration with the corruption that pervades almost every public interface with government even though the cash ban has produced enormous hardship for me and my family i support what mr modi is doing for our country said hem raj chechi 39 a taxi driver in new delhi the capital who said business had been down 50 percent since the ban was announced mr chechi has not been able to pay his children s school fees or send money back to his village to support them for nearly two months but he said we need to fight black money even though it is hurting little people like me mr modi came to power as a disruptive force pledging to overturn the status quo in new delhi bring jobs and fight corruption indians have repeatedly taken to the streets in recent years to demand an end to corruption widely seen as being most detrimental to the poor and powerless declaring war on corruption mr modi announced on nov 8 that 500 and 1 000 rupee bills worth about 8 and 15 would be banned the next morning with the currency ban mr modi has managed to convince many disaffected indians that he is on their side he has also used his powerful skills as a communicator to persuade people like mr chechi that the pain stemming from the ban is for the good that frustration with a political and business elite viewed by many as corrupt is what drove many americans to vote for donald j trump last year said eswar s prasad an economics professor at cornell university who is a native of india trump made the case that only he could effect change by blowing up the system mr prasad said in an interview modi in the same way did have a persuasive narrative that small changes at the margins can t tackle problems like corruption we needed big and painful changes really disruptive ones mr modi appeared on television on new year s eve to tell indians he understood their pain and urge them to bear with him in the aim of creating a better nation he compared his cash ban to the freedom struggle led by mohandas k gandhi a battle of good versus evil today mahatma gandhi is not among us but the path that was truth that he showed us is still most appropriate mr modi said using the honorific for gandhi as we begin the centenary year of the satyagraha he said referring to gandhi s nonviolent resistance movement let us recall the mahatma and resolve to follow his message of truth and goodness mr modi was presiding over one of the major economies in the world when he announced the ban on the rupee notes which made up 86 percent of the money in circulation it s a little bit crazy said geng xiao a professor of finance and public policy at the university of hong kong when i first read the news i couldn t even figure out if it was true the government said that people depositing large amounts of old currency more than 250 000 rupees or about 3 670 could be asked to prove that they had paid taxes on it some saw vast amounts of untaxed holdings suddenly rendered worthless whether mr modi s move will actually reduce corruption is a matter of debate some economists believe it could pave the way for other measures intended to discourage bribery or restructure the economy but others say the currency ban is unlikely to result in a significant reduction in corruption even as it has inconvenienced hundreds of millions of people who have struggled to get enough cash to meet their daily needs while the government tries to print enough new notes to replace the banned ones and a country short of cash has been unable to spend it which is likely to reduce economic growth in the short term economists say people living on the edge of poverty have been hit hard their diets and livelihoods severely affected many in india see mr modi who has also had success persuading parliament to clear the way for a unified tax to make it easier to ship and sell things across state lines as living up to his promise to be a reformer of india s ossified and bureaucratic economy but in the process he has placed the indian economy and his political future at risk many economists believe that the indian economy will take at least a hit because of a dire shortage of cash and that the future impact is uncertain if the effects are prolonged the public support for modi could wane if this move damages the economy he s in for a rough ride said harsh pant the head of strategic studies at the observer research foundation a new delhi think tank mr xiao said that in a system in which the informal sector is substantial the economy could be expected to experience a shock when so much cash is suddenly taken out you need offsetting stimulus policies to keep the economy growing he said mr modi was elected by an overwhelming majority in 2014 defeating the government led by the indian national congress party that had ruled for most of the country s life on the promise of bringing development and jobs and reducing corruption in 2014 he had presented himself as the big disrupter mr pant said he was the precursor to what s happening in the west mr modi was then the chief minister of the state of gujarat where he had a reputation for tearing away the country s red tape so businesses could set up shop and expand but during his first two years after winning national election mr modi whose party did not control the upper house of parliament struggled to achieve a significant economic overhaul mr modi changed the political narrative in 2016 as he successfully fought to get parliament to clear the way for the simplified tax he cast the opposition as people who don t want change who don t want reform mr pant said forcing them in august to support the changes but the challenges facing mr modi remain considerable seven weeks after the cash ban began to be put in place the currency shortage remains acute leading to a sharp drop in demand for services and earnings many providers said nagender tiwari 42 a rickshaw driver in east delhi said he was earning only 60 percent of the 1 000 rupees or about 15 that he used to take home daily before the cash ban as a result his family which includes two children in 11th grade has reduced its consumption of fish and meat they have been unable to pay the rent on their home he said he said he was skeptical about whether the ban was reducing corruption noting that he continued to be stopped by traffic police officers who extorted bribes so if bribery is not stopped how can black money be stopped he asked raj kumar bindal 65 a paper trader in new delhi said sales that plummeted to nearly nothing in the days after the cash ban had returned to about half of what they were before we can t shift to a cashless mode overnight he said surjit bhalla a new economic adviser for the observatory group in new york said he believed mr modi was likely to enact several other major changes in the coming months possibly including a move to a simplified personal income tax india needs to reduce the incentives for taxpayers to cheat mr bhalla said in the united states for every 100 collected in income tax an estimated 20 owed is not paid he added in india for that same 100 in taxes paid 200 more is owed he said collectively the cash ban and other anticorruption initiatives have the potential to transform india mr pant and others said but doing so depends on mr modi s continuing to command the political narrative of the country as he has so successfully done since instituting the cash ban so far he has taken control of the narrative and the people are with him mr pant said he thinks he can continue to do it but we really don t know there are so many unknowns ',\n",

sunday night the team fulfilled rodgers promise much of the drama of the matchup between division rivals was eliminated earlier in the day when the redskins lost to the giants thus guaranteeing both the packers and lions would be playoff teams but the n f c north bragging rights and a home game in the first round of the playoffs were sufficient motivation for green bay to push hard enough to secure the team s sixth consecutive win and the third consecutive loss for detroit pundits had spent the week deciphering all of the wild scenarios that could play out for positioning among the remaining teams but when all was said and done ten of the teams that were in line for a playoff spot remained in the same seeding order no 6 detroit lions at no 3 seattle seahawks time 8 15 p m eastern saturday on nbc the seahawks title hopes took a crushing blow when earl thomas was lost for the season with a broken leg after the injury the seahawks went with the wins coming with major

enough against a reeling oakland squad that lost derek carr to a broken leg in week 16 matt mcgloin to a shoulder injury in week 17 and fell all the way from the no 2 seed in the a f c to no 5 it is

a week after losing derek carr the team s quarterback and a legitimate candidate for most valuable player to a broken leg the oakland raiders were crushed by the denver broncos that combined with the kansas city chiefs victory over the san diego chargers vaulted the chiefs from a spot all the way to the no 2 seed in the a f c which comes with a bye in the playoffs the loss for oakland added to the

mcgloin injured his shoulder in the loss to the broncos beyond the switch to the chiefs as the no in the a f c it was business as usual for the teams that will get bye weeks in the playoffs the new

the redskins from contention while most of the races were straight forward one of the crazier playoff scenarios that had been discussed before the week was the possibility that the tampa bay buccaneers could find themselves in the playoffs they simply had to shoot the moon by beating the carolina panthers having the redskins tie the giants the packers lose to the lions and should all of that happen they simply required wins by indianapolis dallas tennessee and san francisco to top the packers in strength of schedule tampa bay took care of their end by beating the panthers early in

       " 'paris when the islamic state was about to be driven out of the ancient city of palmyra in march yves ubelmann got a call from syria s director of antiquities to come over in a hurry an architect by training mr ubelmann 36 had worked in syria before the country was engulfed by war but now there was special urgency for the kind of work his youthful team of architects mathematicians and designers did from their cramped offices in paris producing digital copies of threatened historical sites palmyra parts of it already destroyed by the islamists who deemed these monuments idolatrous was still rigged with explosives so he and houmam saad his syrian colleague spent four days flying a drone with a robot camera over the crumbled arches and temples drones with four or six rotors can hover really close and register structural details every crack and hole and we can take very precise measurements said mr ubelmann who founded the company iconem this is the stuff architects and archaeologists need they need it in a new push for virtual preservation that scientists archaeologists and others like mr ubelmann are compiling on a large scale the records could be used to create computer models that would show how monuments and endangered historical sites might one day be restored repaired or reconstructed of special interest today are ancient sites in syria and also iraq that have suffered from war looting and the islamic state palmyra was very difficult mr ubelmann said the terrorists were uploading videos with them blowing up monuments and smashing statues to manipulate public opinion he said we felt the best response was to magnify the pictures of these places and show their splendor and their importance to the culture it became a war of images the latest front in that war is in the exhibition halls of the grand palais in paris where through jan 9 many of the 40 000 images he and his team took at palmyra have become the basis for displays called eternal sites from bamiyan to palmyra the show aims to draw attention to the rising threats to global heritage to underscore the exhibition s political importance it was opened several weeks ago by president françois hollande of france who described it as an act of resistance against terror and intolerance showing the beauty of the middle eastern heritage he said is the best answer to the islamist propaganda of hate destruction and death martinez the director of the louvre and the lead curator of the show said the sites had been chosen because all are under threat from pillaging neglect or destruction and are not accessible to the public he said it aimed to mobilize public opinion in the face of the devastation of unique heritage besides images from palmyra the multimedia show projects enormous photographs and videos immersing visitors in different eras including the ancient iraqi city of khorsabad around 700 b c an mosque in damascus and a medieval christian citadel mr ubelmann dismissed any criticism of collaboration with the government of the syrian president bashar we were working pro bono not for any government but to help the archaeologists he said they shared their work with the syrian archaeologists he said adding we also train our colleagues so they can later do this on their own what is paramount is memory and potential restoration in the last year his team has flown drones over some 20 historic sites in syria recently it moved into zones in iraq close to the front line in the fight against the islamic state the team is now analyzing the war s effects on the remains of once thriving cities dating back some 3 000 years including nineveh khorsabad and the thrashed temple and palace of nimrud where the government drove out the jihadists in november in 2015 islamists sent out videos showing militants using sledgehammers to break reliefs of human figures and mythical winged bulls as part of their campaign nimrud was probably the most splendid of the assyrian cities layla abdulkarim a syrian architect said as she analyzed aerial photographs using drones in archaeological work is not entirely new specialists say but at a recent gathering in paris researchers from europe and the middle east said they were now having to practice war archaeology that is collecting reliable data from areas the images from the drones in war zones had proved immensely valuable but these were barely scratching the surface before the war close to 150 archaeological projects were underway just in syria researchers said experts from many countries are trying to assess the damage in syria s old cities but also in the area where the islamic state held sway that is straddling iraq and syria the region that is seen as central to human history and often called the birthplace of modern economics and writing there is an outcry for data about the havoc wreaked in yemen by saudi bombing people are exchanging satellite images and data on blogs and other research platforms but we have no real assessment yet because so many ancient sites are not accessible said pascal butterlin a professor of archaeology at the sorbonne in paris time is of the essence even in the case of ruins mr butterlin said he has led expeditions for more than 20 years to mari near syria s border with iraq before fleeing the guards at mari reported that looters had come from iraq he said we need to know what places need to be stabilized and how looters have altered the sites he said important evidence like clandestine pits can disappear very quickly through sandstorms and erosion cheikhmous ali a syrian archaeologist based in france who founded the international group the association for the protection of syrian archaeology said reports of organized pillaging continued a first wave of looting began in 2012 mr ali said and looting has accelerated since 2014 with the arrival of the islamic state while jihadists were more motivated to destroy the artifacts they had also allowed looters to operate in exchange for money mr ali said he kept an ever changing tally of museums bombed objects carted off safes stolen the exhibition in paris which is drawing large crowds coincides with history begins in mesopotamia a show at the louvre s regional museum in lens both exhibitions highlight the french government s active concern about cultural damage in syria which was briefly controlled by france in the first half of the 20th century mr hollande has taken a strong interest condemning the deliberate destruction of patrimony by all sides as war crimes this past month france offered 30 million toward a proposed 100 million fund to protect sites as fighting abates provide emergency storage for artifacts and eventually rehabilitate monuments at the eternal sites opening at the grand palais mr hollande stressed that france was taking in more syrian refugees trying to protect monuments of great historical and cultural importance did not mean ignoring the suffering of the population should we be concerned about the patrimony he asked what is more important saving lives or saving stones in reality these two are inseparable ',\n",

meisel and herb ritts were recruited by stars such as madonna chris isaak and janet jackson to burnish their visuals but the convergence of a maker s irresistible rhythms and lyrics a group of models at the peak of their fame and a director on the verge of his own runaway success gave freedom 90 a jolt of stylish energy that has yet to fade after more than a directed by david fincher who was at the start of his film career and filmed over several days at merton park studios in london the video from mr michael s 1990 album listen without prejudice vol 1 brought together five models naomi campbell linda evangelista christy turlington cindy crawford and tatjana patitz who were then the queens of fashion it runs for six and a half minutes and its production also gathered a team of novice professionals who would go on to become major forces in fashion including the stylist camilla nickerson the hairdresser guido palau the makeup artist carol brown and the model john pearson shot in moody romantic tones freedom 90 had been viewed more than 37 million times on youtube by the time of mr michael s unexpected death at 53 last sunday reached by phone this week some of the participants recalled their experiences on set and some of the video s most ardent fans reflected on its impact naomi campbell model we d done a british vogue cover with peter lindbergh with all of us i met george in l a and he said i ve been told that i need to speak to you to get the girls for the video what would it take to get you we were living in america so i said you d have to fly us in basically i said yes and then christy and tatjana and everyone came in the night before the video i didn t sleep at all because we did five shows for thierry mugler in paris he had 76 models and it was the big finale of him designing although none of us knew that then the last show finished at around 3 o clock in the morning and george was there so from there i went back to my hotel packed my bags and went on the first flight to london david fincher knew exactly what he wanted he didn t really give us parts but he knew exactly which part of the song he wanted each and every one of us to sing i was more the active one cindy was sultry i don t think any of us knew what it would become we knew the song was a hit but we didn t know in any way what effect it would have in terms of videos the way it would affect people we were all really excited on the day it was going to be aired they all had great premieres back in the day they don t have them anymore not that i ve seen mtv s changed hasn t it i got to see george a little bit more after that because kate moss was neighbors with him when we did the olympics he sang there in london we all did the finale and he was rehearsing and kate and i went to watch him with this amazing choir singing freedom after he invited us all back to his home and he had this really nice in the garden and we all got to light these wishing lanterns and we all did that together that s the memory i m going to keep guido palau hairdresser i don t know how i got the job george michael and david fincher had seen some of my work in british vogue it was a different time then it was a big big production a video because they had to bring in all the girls every girl had a day though christy and linda were there together my part was to make the girls the best they could look as who they were they weren t playing characters they were playing themselves and each had their own personality linda the comedian christy much more classic cindy the pinup tatjana this kind of film noir and naomi a very strong kind of woman we extracted that from them they weren t prodded at all though there were some surprises like linda s hair which she d done for a job for someone else it wasn t like i said oh dye your hair blond not at all at the time we really didn t realize how iconic the video would become i was probably a bit naïve about the whole thing seeing how it was a bit of a job for me what i remember most is the days being very long and at the end of the day the red wine would come out there we d be in the location van drinking and singing with george tatjana patitz model i was in my own zone i had to kind of slide up and down the wall for part of the day the feel of the set was so this big loft kind of vibe there was another setup with me laying on a chaise longue with a black smoking jacket i think i may have had a bustier on and i was smoking even people still smoked in videos then and even in films george michael wasn t on the set the day i was there but i d met him a few times in l a herb ritts shot a cover of me and him for a magazine i m trying to remember what magazine it was so many magazines have come and gone glamour was very present in fashion in those days feminine glamour people looking at inspiration from the movie stars of the 40s and 50s audrey hepburn grace kelly and ava gardner a lot of magazines were pairing models with pop stars or movie stars to shoot covers it was very different those days the business was much smaller and wasn t as saturated not as fast as it is now models were known by their first names and suddenly the glamour we embodied at that time crossed over to pop music videos and film we were part of the entertainment industry which made it really fun george was very nice almost a little shy maybe that s the wrong word he was mellow and kind i was quite at the time because i grew up with wham and their music he was one of my first teenage crushes in the five or so times i met him he was always very pleasant and sweet but timid not one of those vivacious people who take a room by storm i remember the shoot being in fall or early winter i flew in on the concorde for the day and flew back to new york right after that it s funny a lot of people were using models in videos then but this one in particular stood the test of time it s not like you look at freedom 90 now and say oh my god it s so 80s it s not like working girl john pearson model my agent called up and said hey do you want to do this video all the big girls are doing it of course i said yes i was a big george michael fan i used to see him all the time in london at the clubs i arrived at the studios at 3 o clock in the afternoon and met david fincher briefly and then basically sat around all day and watched while christy and linda were being shot there s one shot where linda puts her head underneath her sweater that s amazing that wasn t rehearsed linda really knows how to use her body to communicate in an elegant way never cheap and tawdry george was there very warm and nice but very shy the day went long and the producer said at the end of the day can we shoot you tomorrow i didn t have another job booked so i said sure then he said do you mind doing it for nothing i said no way it was a little bit bolshie of me but i knew what the girls were getting in the end i was paid 15 000 for the day which is not bad to hang out with these fabulous beautiful girls but i d been working nonstop for three years and i wasn t going to do it for free and it turned out to be one of those fabulously easy jobs everyone riding on this wave of semistardom and recognition for the models i really didn t realize how big it all was at the time candis cayne actress model and former drag personality there was a group of girls in n y c in the 90s and we didn t want to model ourselves on anything other than the supermodels linda and naomi and christy so when the video of freedom came out and they were all in it we were obsessed i used to do shows at boy bar so i decided i was going to do freedom and got lina and mistress formika and sherry vine to play the various parts i was linda she was my favorite we did the whole thing naked under white sheets after the very last chorus we dropped the sheets and were completely naked holding our groin areas that song meant a lot to us there were singers we knew were gay then but no one really talked about it we just grabbed onto songs and artists who knew who and what we were whether it was madonna with vogue and truth or dare or george michael with freedom i don t know if he was openly gay or not then i guess not but it was almost o k because we all knew and it was such a homophobic time it was so oppressive particularly when you factor in the aids epidemic to be open would have been a career killer but going to a club listening to freedom it was an escape alan hunter one of the original mtv v j s it was a funny moment in my life i was driving my kid to day care on a day where i didn t know where my career had gone i d left mtv my agent wasn t calling i was depressed and i turned on the radio and on came george michael s new song it was george michael at the peak of his writing skills it was such a brilliant capstone i d ever heard it was his song he was saying everything that brought me to pop stardom i now disavow then i saw the video shortly thereafter with all that iconography he d used in his past and he literally sets those things on fire and explodes them the leather jacket he d worn and the jukebox from faith and he just steps away

       " 'washington the most powerful and ambitious congress in 20 years will convene tuesday with plans to leave its mark on virtually every facet of american life refashioning the country s social safety net wiping out scores of labor and environmental regulations and unraveling some of the most significant policy prescriptions put forward by the obama administration even before donald j trump is sworn in on jan 20 giving their party full control of the government republicans plan quick action on several of their top priorities most notably a measure to clear a path for the affordable care act s repeal perhaps the first thing that will happen in the new congress is the push for deregulation also up early filling a supreme court seat which is sure to set off a pitched showdown and starting confirmation hearings for mr trump s cabinet nominees it s a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results said senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky the majority leader and we intend to do it but as republicans plan to reserve the first 100 days of congress for their more partisan goals democrats are preparing roadblocks the party s brutal wounds have been salted by evidence of russian election interference mr trump s cabinet picks and his taunting twitter posts on saturday he offered new year s wishes to all including those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don t know what to do obstacles will also come from republicans who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code some are also skittish about certain policy proposals like vast changes to medicare that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate and any burst of legislative action will come only if congress can break free of its longstanding tendency toward gridlock for republicans the path to this moment has been long and transparently paved the house in particular has signaled the republican policy vision through bills it has been passing for years but many of those measures have gathered dust in the senate or been doused in veto ink the cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent house republican majority in the speaker newt gingrich took control with a determined agenda only to be stymied by the senate majority leader bob dole who stacked conservative house bills like so many fire logs in the back of the senate chamber they ve been given a golden opportunity here said trent lott the former republican senate majority leader but i have watched over the years when one party has had control of the white house and the senate and the house and the danger is overplaying your hand if you go too far like what happened with obamacare and you get no support at all from the other side you have a problem mr lott continued you have to find a way to work with people across the aisle who will work with you the tax overhaul and an infrastructure bill may be two opportunities for bipartisan cooperation the senate finance committee is already moving in that direction still both of those issues are expected to remain on the back burner despite promises to the contrary from mr trump s chief of staff reince priebus the senate may be narrowly divided but among the 48 senators in the democratic caucus are 10 who will stand for in two years in states that voted for mr trump republicans are counting on their support at least some of the time but on many issues senate democrats including their new leader chuck schumer of new york are expected to pivot from postelection carping to active thwarting using complex senate procedures and political messaging to slow or perhaps block elements of mr trump s agenda after campaigning on a promise to help the middle class trump s postelection actions suggest he intends to do the exact opposite after he s sworn in said senator patty murray democrat of washington democrats will do everything we can to fight back if he continues to pursue an agenda prioritizing billionaires and big corporations while devastating families and the economy republicans have chafed for years at a host of rules many that president obama has issued through the regulatory process and they have been advising the trump team on which ones should be undone i hear probably more about the strangulation of regulations on business and their growth and their development than probably anything else the house speaker paul d ryan of wisconsin said at a recent forum i think if we can provide regulatory relief right away that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy in late december the obama administration rolled out a major new environmental regulation intended to rein in mining that regulation one of dozens that mr trump is expected to reverse is meant to go into effect one day before his inauguration but congress is likely to block it using the obscure congressional review act which permits lawmakers to undo new regulations with only 51 senate votes within the first 60 legislative days of the rules completion given time constraints on the senate floor members will have to pick some priorities they are expected to train their sights on a rule that requires oil and gas producers to reduce methane gases another that requires mining and fossil fuel companies to disclose payments they have made to foreign governments to extract natural resources and still others that restrict pesticide use republicans will also move quickly to repeal the affordable care act they plan to pass a truncated budget resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year already a quarter over that includes special instructions ensuring that the final repeal legislation could circumvent any democratic filibuster but republican leaders have not settled on a health care plan to replace mr obama s and they may delay the repeal measure s effective date for years the senate must also consider mr trump s cabinet picks and senate democrats are already trying to slow the process however they cannot do much more than that because when they were in charge they changed the rules so that presidential nominees other than supreme court picks need only 51 votes to be confirmed previously such nominations could face a filibuster which required 60 votes to overcome democratic leaders have encouraged members to avoid meeting with mr trump s nominees until they have turned over their tax returns and made other disclosures republicans have been particularly upset that senator jeff sessions of alabama whom mr trump picked quickly to be attorney general has either not gotten meetings with democrats on the senate judiciary committee or had meetings canceled senator dianne feinstein of california postponed her meeting with mr sessions until january because she said her schedule got too busy the senator doesn t want to rush said her spokesman tom mentzer one reason that democrats are in no hurry is their bitterness over mr mcconnell s refusal last year to hold a hearing on the supreme court nomination of judge merrick b garland lingering in the background is the specter of russia democrats and some republicans who are at odds with mr trump on the issue and may at times be a brake on him want a vigorous investigation of its efforts to disrupt the election the obama administration which took sweeping steps last week to punish the russians over election hacking will release a report this month that is likely to serve as a turning point in those discussions while republicans may have a rare chance to open the flow of legislation the party s leaders are acutely aware of the punishment that americans have historically delivered in midterm elections when things have not gone well this is no time for hubris mr mcconnell said you have to perform ',\n",
       " 'washington it s or time for republicans after a tumultuous decade that has seen profound changes in the makeup and character of their party republicans are poised to complete their slow but steady climb back to power as they seize control of the house senate and the white house for the first time since 2006 that political triad will leave them with a splendid opportunity for success but there is little room for failure if they hope to satisfy their impatient constituents and deliver on bold promises to reshape the nation s health care delivery system restructure the tax code drive job creation muscle up american foreign policy rebuild a crumbling infrastructure and set america on a new course republicans who will take command of the senate and house as the 115th congress convenes on tuesday have long been itching for a chance to do it their way constantly grousing that president obama and congressional democrats held back american progress and economic growth now they must show they can deliver and they know it when you have both houses and the presidency there is no acceptable excuse for not passing major legislation said representative tom cole a senior republican from oklahoma there is a lot of pressure on republican members to produce and to produce quickly that will not be easy there is a mutual wariness between many republicans in congress and donald j trump leaving it unclear how often their interests and priorities will coalesce or collide some of the biggest fights might well be between republicans on capitol hill and the white house occupied by a man who campaigned against the establishment and some of the very republicans running congress republicans must also maneuver while facing slightly expanded democratic minorities in the house and senate in a climate that is in many respects even more hostile than it was before the november elections democrats remain angry at how republicans treated president obama including their refusal to consider the nomination of federal judge merrick b garland to the united states supreme court democrats want payback for the cold shoulder given to mr garland s nomination to satisfy themselves and to show their supporters that they are not going to roll over for the new republican government while they cannot employ the filibuster to block most nominations they still retain it for supreme court picks and legislation at least for now perhaps most important republicans themselves are going to need something of an attitude adjustment the contemporary republican party has been built out of fierce opposition to mr obama and deep disdain for activist government nearly of current house republicans have never served with a republican president and their entire time in washington has been spent fighting the executive branch as a result republicans have had the luxury of being able to argue for positions that appealed to their conservative base but that they knew would not become law because senate democrats would block them or because the president would veto them now if they can assemble the votes their ideas will become law with all the attendant consequences republicans who have shied from the responsibility of government will now be called upon to support increases in the debt limit approve annual budgets endorse spending bills and back other measures that they formerly left to the democrats and some of their more compromising colleagues with democrats unlikely to help on many of those votes after being castigated for them by republicans the republicans who belonged to the vote no hope yes caucus when it came to critical legislation in recent years now will have to vote yes and hope things go well this isn t the same style of republican majority pushed from power after being routed in the 2006 midterm elections after the public backlash to the administration of president george w bush and his handling of the war in iraq forged by the tea party revolt that restored republicans to control of the house in the 2010 elections and in the senate in 2014 this party is much more conservative with a membership that tends to see government as an impediment to be leveled not as a force to be shaped to their views to the benefit of their constituents eight years of railing against the obama administration has infused them and their constituents with a hostility and disregard for the government that republicans must now lead rather than ridicule tensions could arise between house and senate republicans as well when the newt party took over the house in 1995 for the first time in four decades newly empowered republicans sent a raft of legislation to the senate only to see it stall there with president bill clinton in the white house at the time republicans knew much of it would not be enacted now with mr trump soon to occupy the oval office it is unlikely that house republicans will be willing to watch democrats bottle up legislation in the senate demands that their senate counterparts eliminate the filibuster could mount quickly while they understand the challenges republicans are nonetheless jubilant at their enviable position a republican in the white house and a republican majority in congress present tremendous opportunity to make real progress senator cory gardner republican of colorado said in the party s weekly radio address on saturday we assume that responsibility with the promise that we ll work hard to do everything that we can to deliver more opportunities to americans tomorrow than they have today i am pretty giddy said mr cole as he looked ahead republicans have won their chance now it is time to see what they can do with it ',\n",

       " 'the body of the iraqi prisoner was found naked and badly bruised in 2003 outside a detention center in southern iraq run by united states marines the man had been beaten deprived of sleep forced to stand for long periods and interrogated by marines about his alleged role in a fatal ambush of american forces james n mattis donald j trump s nominee for secretary of defense was then a major general and the commander of the marine division in iraq responsible for the center he quickly convened an inquiry into the death which led to and banned the harsh techniques used at the prison general mattis was all up in arms over this ralph dengler then a lieutenant colonel testified at a military hearing in january 2004 he added that the commander who arrived hours after the discovery on a planned visit with his british counterpart had immediately described the death as the worst thing that happened under his watch in the iraq war i was surprised that he would have felt that strongly about it considering many of the other deaths including american deaths colonel dengler said colleagues say the general s handling of the episode reflects his firmly held views against torture and prisoner mistreatment which are shared by many military leaders and could put them at odds with the new commander in chief mr trump in a new york times interview in late november said he had been surprised to learn that the man he was considering to lead the country s 2 2 million service members did not believe in torture during the presidential campaign mr trump advocated bringing back the practice of waterboarding adding that only a stupid person would say it doesn t work general mattis does not support abusive techniques let alone waterboarding give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers he told mr trump during their meeting in november according to the and i do better with that than i do with torture the general s beliefs were shaped by his military training but also by his experiences in dealing with issues related to torture or mistreatment according to an examination of his nearly career and interviews with former colleagues and friends general mattis led the united states central command from august 2010 to march 2013 lt col t g taylor who was general mattis s spokesman during much of that time said in an interview that the commander had spoken of america as needing to hold the moral high ground failing to uphold important principles makes it easier for a soldier or a marine to ask what am i fighting for colonel taylor said that is something that general mattis is keenly aware of he added as a young officer general mattis would have been instructed in the laws of war including the geneva conventions which among other protections require humane treatment of prisoners of war a marine who enlisted in 1969 while attending college part of an r o t c program during the height of the vietnam war he did not deploy to vietnam but several friends say he believed that american prisoners of war were more likely to be tortured by the vietcong if the united states tortured enemy captives in 2006 general mattis supported gen david h petraeus of the army and other military leaders in the development of a new counterinsurgency field manual that highlighted limits on interrogation tactics torture and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment is never a morally permissible option even if lives depend on gaining information the manual said lose moral legitimacy lose the war general mattis later agreed in a senate armed services committee hearing that it was inappropriate for the military to support the use of abusive techniques on detainees including waterboarding forced nudity and sensory deprivation tactics inflicted on prisoners during interrogations in secret c i a prisons in the years after the 2001 terrorist attacks those techniques had been modeled on a military training program operated by the joint personnel recovery agency which later fell under the general s command that program survival evasion resistance and escape also known as sere exposed united states soldiers and other service members to techniques that an enemy violating the laws of war might use so that americans could be better prepared to resist them the experience typically led trainees to conclude that tortured prisoners of war will say whatever they need to in order to stay alive whether true or not a recent investigation by the new york times found that many terrorism suspects subjected to harsh tactics in c i a jails or american military prisons had lasting mental health problems that were similar to those experienced by some american former p o w s who suffered horrific abuses in vietnam or korea as a commander in afghanistan and later in iraq and as an overall leader of the american war effort general mattis often grappled with the consequences of the c i a s treatment of prisoners and the harsh conditions at the military detention center at guantánamo bay cuba they became a powerful recruiting tool for jihadis who threatened american forces in the field testifying at a senate hearing in 2015 after his retirement general mattis opposed the release before the end of hostilities of prisoners who had fought against the united states however he added they should be treated humanely in accordance with international and domestic law i would go by the geneva conventions and maintain them with red cross oversight until the war is over he told lawmakers torture is not effective in eliciting intelligence the general felt for his whole career he s believed that it just doesn t pay dividends said a retired senior united states military officer who is close to general mattis but spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of alienating mr trump the pack of cigarettes reference according to people who served with the general reflects two tenets that are drummed into future military leaders that information gleaned from torture is unreliable and that can go a long way i m not in his head but what general mattis was saying is that offering a modicum of friendship and humanity to someone in a desperate situation is more successful than physical torture colonel taylor said hope hicks a spokeswoman for mr trump s transition team declined requests for more detail on the s discussions with general mattis or on the source of general mattis s beliefs and any further thoughts mr trump has had about the use of torture general mattis declined to be interviewed many american military leaders maintain that the bush administration s departure from established practices in allowing harsh coercive techniques government lawyers had said they did not meet the legal definition of torture and had declared that detainees were not protected by the geneva conventions tainted the united states reputation while not yielding results ineffective war crime against our values moral high ground et cetera donald j guter a retired rear admiral and the dean of the south texas college of law said in explaining objections to brutal treatment a very practical reason is that it opens the door for our own troops to be tortured and we have no basis to object if we torture we ve lost who we are the department of defense has clear policies on the humane treatment of detainees for example the army field manual s section on intelligence collection states use of torture is not only illegal but also it is a poor technique that yields unreliable results the manual adds cruel inhuman and degrading treatment is prohibited as a commander in iraq general mattis ordered several investigations into detainee abuse one of the most significant concerned the 2003 death at a makeshift detention and interrogation center in an abandoned iraqi army barracks in southern iraq christened camp whitehorse prisoners were held by united states marine reservists in extreme heat in a dirty stone building that had been looted of all amenities by iraqis during the invasion the prisoner who died nagem sadoon hatab had been arrested days earlier on suspicion of involvement in a deadly ambush of a united states army convoy that led to the capture of jessica lynch a private who was later rescued mr hatab was alleged to have killed american service members and sold an rifle taken from one of them mr hatab failed to stand up while being subjected to treatment forced standing for 50 minutes of each hour for up to 10 hours the objective was to make the detainees tired stressed and submissive for interrogators witnesses later said in military court hearings like other prisoners at the center mr hatab was hooded and his hands were restrained behind his back with plastic ties he was beaten severely by marine guards after refusing to comply with the forced standing and he also underwent questioning by a special marine interrogation squad a marine guard later testified that he had often heard yelling screaming and banging from the interrogation room a converted bathroom after midnight on june 6 2003 mr hatab was found dead in a courtyard where he had been left lying for hours his body covered in his own feces an armed forces medical examiner categorized the death as a homicide mr hatab had six broken ribs and had suffocated from a broken bone in his throat after being dragged outside by his neck the examiner concluded eight camp whitehorse personnel were charged with crimes including negligent homicide but the investigator appointed by general mattis col william b gallo later cited problems with the autopsy and could not determine which of the attacks on mr hatab if any might have been lethal in colonel gallo s opinion the treatment did not amount to torture but the command had failed to provide adequate predeployment training in handling prisoners and in the law of war evidence including certain photographs of the prisoner and a summary of an interrogation he underwent had been lost or destroyed complicating the investigation and prosecution two marines a major and a sergeant were eventually convicted of lesser charges mr hatab s death clearly had an effect on general mattis according to reports at the time he ordered a review of the procedures for handling prisoners which resulted in a ban of tactics including the forced standing marine corps personnel running detention camps were given more training and a manual was compiled to explain each step of the process still there were several other instances of prisoner abuse involving the division later aiming to earn the trust of the iraqi people after the first phase of combat had ended general mattis added an addendum to the motto of his marines no better friend no worse enemy the addition was first do no harm ',\n",
       " 'istanbul the islamic state on monday issued a rare claim of responsibility for an attack in turkey after a new year s day shooting at an istanbul nightclub that killed at least 39 people describing the gunman who carried out the assault and who has not been identified or captured as a hero soldier of the caliphate the turkish authorities are still searching for the gunman who killed a police officer guarding the reina nightclub before going on a shooting rampage with a rifle but the state news media reported that eight suspects had been detained in connection with the attack the authorities on monday released two photographs of the person suspected of being the gunman captured by security cameras that showed a cleanshaven man in a dark winter coat the government s spokesman numan kurtulmus said at a news conference that investigators believed they found the assailant s fingerprints and that they were close to identifying him mr kurtulmus did not mention the islamic state specifically but he said turkey would press the fight against terrorism referring to the attack which happened just after midnight on sunday morning mr kurtulmus said the fact that it was done during the first minutes of 2017 gives an important message the message is we will go on to menace turkey in 2017 and we say to them we will break into your caves wherever you are the turkish newspaper hurriyet reported on monday that the gunman might be from kyrgyzstan or elsewhere in central asia the russian news agency interfax quoted aiymkan kulukeyeva a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry in kyrgyzstan as saying according to preliminary information this information is doubtful but we are checking all the same the islamic state asserted in a statement that the attack had been carried out in continuation of the blessed operations that the islamic state is conducting against turkey the protector of the cross a hero soldier of the caliphate attacked one of the most famous nightclubs where christians celebrated their pagan holiday read the statement from the islamic state also known as isis or isil they used hand grenades and a machine gun and transformed their celebration to mourning in an apparent reference to turkey s role in the conflict in syria the statement warned that the government of turkey should know that the blood of muslims which it is targeting with its planes and its guns will cause a fire in its home by god s will the statement did not name the assailant and it was not clear whether the islamic state had organized the attack or had merely inspired the gunman but the shooting came just days after a state group the nashir media foundation published the latest in a series of messages calling for attacks on clubs markets and movie theaters the islamic state s claim of responsibility came after years of complex relations between the turkish state and the jihadist group operating across its southern border several terrorist attacks in turkey over the last year have been attributed to the islamic state but the militant group rarely claims responsibility for major attacks in the country a rare exception came in november when the group claimed to be behind a deadly car bombing in southeastern turkey analysts said that the islamic state has walked a fine line in turkey trying to balance its goal of destabilizing the country without antagonizing the government to the extent that it would crack down heavily for years turkey looked the other way according to analysts and regional diplomats as jihadist groups moved fighters and supplies across the border establishing deep networks in turkish border towns committed to supporting the uprising against president bashar of syria turkey felt the jihadists could be managed while they fought with forces loyal to the syrian government but that policy ultimately changed as turkey worked to secure its borders under pressure from its allies as it took in millions of syrian refugees and as terrorist attacks rocked the country turkey began a military intervention in northern syria in august that put its forces on the front lines against kurdish militants as well as islamic state fighters this turned the jihadists decidedly against turkey prompting their leaders to call for attacks there the turkish military said on monday that it had struck islamic state targets in syria killing at least 22 militants american intelligence officials had recently expressed concern about a possible attack in turkey warning in a statement on dec 22 that extremist groups were continuing aggressive efforts to conduct attacks throughout turkey in areas where american citizens and expatriates lived or visited that warning came three days after a gunman described by turkish officials as a police officer assassinated andrey g karlov the russian ambassador to turkey at an art gallery in the capital ankara the gunman shouted god is great and don t forget aleppo don t forget syria during the attack which was captured on video the anadolu news agency said that 38 of the 39 people who died in the attack on sunday had been identified the associated press reported at least two dozen of the people killed were said to be foreigners ',\n",
       " 'washington president obama s advisers wrestled with an intractable problem in the spring and summer of 2015 how could they stabilize afghanistan while preserving mr obama s longtime goal of pulling out the last american troops before he left office as it happened the president solved the problem for them in early august of that year when mr obama convened a meeting of the national security council he looked around the table and acknowledged a stark new reality the fever in this room has finally broken the president told the group according to a person in the meeting we re no longer in mode what mr obama meant was that no one in the situation room that day himself included thought that the united states after 14 years of war billions of dollars spent and more than 2 000 american lives lost would ever transform afghanistan into a semblance of a democracy able to defend itself at the same time he added the counterterrorism challenges are real as bleak as afghanistan s prospects were the united states could not afford to walk away and allow the country to become a seedbed for extremists again a few weeks later the president halted the withdrawal and announced that he would leave thousands of american troops in the country indefinitely it was a crucial turning point in the evolution of barack obama the antiwar candidate of 2008 who had pledged to turn around afghanistan the good war to george w bush s bad war in iraq had conceded that the longest military operation in american history would not end on his watch the optimistic president who once thought afghanistan was winnable had through bitter experience become the commander in chief of a forever war he remains defensive about the lessons of that journey we shouldn t assume that every time a country has problems that it reflects a failure of american policy the president said in an interview in september now as mr obama prepares to turn the war over to donald j trump a leader even more skeptical than he is about the value of american engagement in foreign conflicts afghanistan captures the disillusionment of a man who believed as he put it in his 2009 nobel peace prize acceptance speech that war is sometimes necessary and war at some level is an expression of human folly more than any other conflict afghanistan shaped mr obama s thinking on the basic questions of war peace and the use of military power it is where he discovered his affinity for drones sharpened his belief in the limits of american intervention battled his generals and hardened his disdain for unreliable foreign leaders it reaffirmed his suspicions about sending american troops into foreign conflicts and made him reluctant to use more force in iraq syria libya and other war zones it also chastened him about his own hopes when it comes to helping these societies stabilize and create a more secure environment and a better life for their people we have to understand he said in the interview that this is a long slog mr obama was a state senator from illinois in october 2002 when he famously condemned iraq as a dumb war but in the same speech he also said i don t oppose all wars he was referring to afghanistan which he viewed as a just war to hunt down the perpetrators of the sept 11 terrorist attacks i would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again he told the crowd that day in chicago s federal plaza by july 2008 as the democratic nominee for president mr obama had embraced afghanistan as a priority over iraq the good war in a phrase that he never actually used himself but that became so associated with his approach it was sometimes wrongly attributed to him mr obama praised the bush administration s troop surge in iraq that year not because he believed that the united states could transform iraqi society but because he thought that reducing the violence there would allow the nation to turn its attention to afghanistan this is a war that we have to win he declared he promised to send at least two more combat brigades or roughly 10 000 soldiers to afghanistan the united states was hardly on course for victory although there were already close to 50 000 american troops in afghanistan as mr obama campaigned that summer the taliban were gaining momentum in a bloody debacle nine american soldiers were killed in what became known as the battle of wanat when the taliban brazenly overran a remote army outpost in the far eastern province of nuristan adm mike mullen the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff echoed mr obama in calling the situation in the country precarious and urgent more than 100 americans would die in afghanistan by the end of 2008 a larger number than in any other prior year when mr obama took office in january 2009 he ordered a quick policy review on afghanistan by a former intelligence analyst bruce riedel but even before it was completed he accepted a pentagon recommendation to send 17 000 additional troops to afghanistan bringing the total to nearly 70 000 american troops on the ground by the fall of 2009 with the taliban showing increased strength mr obama s military commanders backed by the elders on his war council including hillary clinton then his secretary of state were pressing him to go much farther they urged on him an ambitious counterinsurgency strategy that had helped turn around the war in iraq a expensive doctrine of trying to win over the locals by building roads bridges schools and a government the strategy known by its acronym coin would require as many as 40 000 additional american men and women in uniform in afghanistan his advisers told him there was still the afterglow of the surge in iraq and the counterinsurgency narrative that had made the military the savior of the iraq war said vali r nasr a former state department adviser on afghanistan and pakistan i don t believe obama was in a position to pick a debate with the military on afghanistan and to assert what would be his worldview in many ways i think he deferred said mr nasr now the dean of the johns hopkins school of advanced international studies although mr obama agreed after months of internal debate to send 30 000 additional troops to afghanistan he placed a strict timetable on the mission saying they would have to be withdrawn again starting in july 2011 his aides later said he felt hijacked by a military that had presented him with a narrow band of options rather than a real choice even some former military commanders agreed saying that the troop deployments were framed in a way that made choosing a smaller number 20 000 for example look like a path to certain defeat president obama was asking the military for broad options said karl w eikenberry a retired general who served as the commander in afghanistan from 2005 to 2007 and was later mr obama s ambassador to kabul but he said the military gave mr obama only variations on the more robust counterinsurgency model mr eikenberry who wrote a politically explosive but prescient cable in late 2009 raising doubts about the wisdom of the surge diagnosed a deeper problem with the policy was it simply to prevent afghanistan from being a safe haven for al qaeda or was it to turn afghanistan into another denmark when he came in everyone knew we were going to do more mr eikenberry said but what we were trying to achieve was difficult to define given mr obama s innate wariness of it didn t take long for him to grow disenchanted with the denmark option a few months into the surge in the spring of 2010 david h petraeus the commander of the pentagon s central command and an architect of the strategy was briefing him on the state of the counterinsurgency campaign drawing on anthropology theory from the university of chicago general petraeus explained to his commander in chief how neighborhoods in kandahar related to one another mr obama listened for a while then cut him off we can t worry about how neighborhoods relate to each other in kandahar he curtly told general petraeus according to people in the room obama believes the military can do enormous things said benjamin j rhodes the deputy national security adviser it can win wars and stabilize conflicts but a military can t create a political culture or build a society by the end of his first term mr obama had evolved to the point that he fully embraced the concept afghan good enough the phrase which had been kicked around the white house since 2010 referred to the shift away from to a policy that was content with taking out the terrorists preventing the taliban from overrunning the country and putting a premium on getting the troops out by that new standard things had improved in afghanistan by august 2010 100 000 american troops were on the ground in afghanistan and were pushing back the taliban in some critical areas despite uneven progress in the military campaign ryan crocker a diplomat who had reopened the american embassy in kabul in 2002 and served there again as ambassador in 2011 recalled thinking wow this place looks great the navy seal raid that killed osama bin laden in pakistan in may 2011 added to mr obama s conviction that he was on the way to closing the books on the war at midnight on may 1 2012 air force one rolled out from behind a hangar at joint base andrews to pick up the president for a secret trip to afghanistan he was going to sign a strategic partnership agreement with president hamid karzai that set the terms for relations after 2014 when the united states was scheduled to withdraw its combat troops and turn over afghanistan s security to the afghans aides to mr obama had advised him not to go for security reasons but he saw it as an important milestone the agreement promised an enduring partnership between the united states and afghanistan with pledges of american help in developing the afghan economy and public institutions yet the promises obscured a starker reality mr obama had accelerated the timetable for drawing down american troops and he was looking beyond the war speaking to a national tv audience from bagram air base he suggested that america s experience in afghanistan had come full circle one year ago from a base here in afghanistan our troops launched the operation that killed osama bin laden he said the goal i set to defeat al qaeda and deny it a chance to rebuild is now within our reach earlier mr obama had met for an hour with mr karzai the two had long had a rocky relationship on an earlier trip mr obama excoriated mr karzai for the rampant corruption in the afghan government and this session did little to improve their rapport mr crocker recalled that the president was very aloof almost cold which bothered me a bit because i d worked a solid damn year to get karzai in a better place with us things never warmed up between them when mr karzai refused to sign a security agreement with washington mr obama gave up on him to focus on his successor ashraf ghani the experience left a lasting imprint on the president his aides said he concluded that without the right partner it was impossible for the united states to succeed no matter how much blood and treasure it poured into a country it was an insight that mr obama applied to his relations with other countries from pakistan to israel where his poor relationships with the leaders impeded progress the most underappreciated part of foreign policy mr rhodes said is dealing with flawed partners when mr obama convened his national security council that day in august 2015 the taliban were regrouping again they had carried out audacious terrorist attacks in the center of kabul and had mounted a military offensive in the provinces of kunduz and oruzgan worse there was a new threat in the form of the islamic state also known as isis or isil which sprouted in the poisonous soil of iraq after the united states left and was finding recruits in the hindu kush mr obama had rejected a chorus of calls in washington to delay the drawdown under which the residual force of american troops was to leave afghanistan by the end of 2016 the mantra i heard was that the president does not want to hand off to his successor the mess he inherited said daniel f feldman who served as the special representative to afghanistan and pakistan in 2014 and 2015 but as the islamic state became a dire enough threat to return american troops to iraq mr obama felt compelled to change course on afghanistan isil thrived in a vacuum in iraq and it pointed to a similar vacuum in afghanistan mr rhodes said mr obama he said was prodded by more than fear after a long stretch of political paralysis afghanistan formed a government with mr ghani in the presidency for the first time since taking office mr obama felt like he had a partner with whom he could do business the afghan army was taking heavy casualties fighting the taliban and the president believed that the united states had an obligation to help them but as mr obama s war council met that august morning the level of american support remained the subject of intense debate vice president joseph r biden jr a skeptic about afghanistan going back to 2009 argued that the country would revert to chaos regardless of how long the united states stayed there it doesn t matter if we leave tomorrow or 10 years from now he declared according to those in the room he was he conceded a broken record on this issue gen martin e dempsey who had succeeded admiral mullen as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff recommended that the united states maintain a military presence in kabul and at bagram and a scattering of bases in the east and south the 10 000 soldiers in the country would carry out a singular ruthless mission of killing suspected terrorists and keeping the country from spiraling out of control the imperative general dempsey told mr obama was that afghanistan fit into a broader counterterrorism policy from central asia to north africa to extend well beyond your presidency according to several officials mr obama liked that idea it was in line he said with the principles he had laid out in a 2014 speech at the united states military academy in west point n y where he said america would train and equip foreign armies but leave the fighting to them he acknowledged that it would mean handing off afghanistan to his successor as unfinished business this goes to the politics of what i m leaving for the next president he told the group according to one of the participants my interest is not to sign them up for 10 years of x he added referring to troop numbers but to lay out a vision and to put stakes in the ground for that vision mr obama now seems at an uneasy peace in the interview in september he disputed the suggestion that his policy had failed he had after all reduced the number of american troops to fewer than 10 000 from more than 100 000 they were training and assisting afghan troops even if the line between that and actual combat was sometimes blurry the country had been broken to begin with he said and america was never going to fix it afghanistan was one of the poorest countries in the world with the lowest literacy rates in the world before we got there it continues to be mr obama said the country was riven with all kinds of ethnic and tribal divisions before we got there it s still there in the end afghanistan became the template for a new kind of warfare a chronic conflict across an arc of unstable states in which the united states is a participant if not the principal actor at a nato summit meeting in warsaw in july mr obama acknowledged that this prospect would disappoint an american public still suffering from combat fatigue it s very hard for us ever to get the satisfaction of macarthur and the emperor meeting and a war being officially over he said as commander in chief of the most powerful military in the world he went on i spend a lot of time brooding over these issues and i m not satisfied we ve got it perfect yet ',\n",
       " 'with the year winding down and new year s resolutions just around the corner it s time to gear up for that clutter purge but the thought of tackling the kitchen junk drawer or even taking down the decorations can be overwhelming so to help motivate you several organizing professionals offered tips on how to streamline your closets beat back the toys taking over the living room and yes finally deal with that junk drawer start with the holiday trappings to keep plastic ornaments and hanukkah candles organized use small containers you already have on hand like popcorn and cookie tins or empty shoeboxes and egg cartons wrap fragile ornaments in leftover tissue paper or newspaper or invest in storage containers like archival ornament boxes from the container store for strings of lights and garlands use zip ties to avoid tangles and put them in plastic bags labeled according to use tree lights porch lights balcony bushes etc zip ties can also be used on wreaths so that they can be hung on coat hangers and covered with plastic garment bags from the dry cleaner to avoid a stockpile of holiday cards save only those that are meaningful and special tova weinstock a professional organizer in brooklyn said for the others appreciate them as you receive them and then kindly send them to the trash edit your closet eliminating clothes you never wear is easier said than done i don t believe in if you haven t used or worn something in a year get rid of it said laura cattano another organizer in brooklyn how you want to live moving forward is a much better guide for editing than whether or not you actually have used something in the past focus on the image you would like to project she said then start at one end of the closet and review each piece pulling out those you know you can toss donate or sell try on anything you haven t worn in a while and consider how it makes you feel or if it could be styled differently clothes you have forgotten about could be your new favorite thing she said while there may be some pieces you wear all the time that should be retired if you subscribe to the marie kondo method of decluttering ask yourself does it spark joy sort clothes by type grouping pants together then shirts or blouses jackets or dresses if you can t see it you won t wear it said sharon lowenheim an organizer on the upper east side of manhattan and the founder of the organizing goddess so remove dry cleaning bags and hang only one item per hanger arranging shirts by sleeve length with the shortest at the front makes them easier to find said ms lowenheim who also subscribes to a rotation method selecting garments to wear from the front of each section then hanging them up toward the back after they are cleaned if you find yourself continually bypassing an item at the front that is a signal to you that you just don t like that item she said get rid of it another way to keep your closet streamlined is to store clothes out of sight said faith roberson an organizer in manhattan and the founder of organize with faith when clothes have been put away for half the year and you ve done fine without them it changes your perspective she said you can honestly ask yourself do i actually love this piece and if i don t why am i holding onto it tackle the toys organizing pros agree that the best way to keep toys from taking over is to get children involved in selecting some to donate finding a charity that provides toys to less fortunate children is very motivating for a child said ms lowenheim whose daughter purged her playthings in this manner before each birthday and holiday starting when she was a toddler before that ms lowenheim said she would sneak into her daughter s room while she was sleeping to gather up the games and stuffed animals she was no longer playing with when she was around 3 she started noticing if something was missing and would ask me about it ms lowenheim said at that point i realized that i had to involve her in the process if they cooperate be sure to respect their decision ms roberson said even if they choose something you wouldn t have parents think about the money they ve spent she said or the sentimental value which can make them reluctant to let go of that american girl doll or the train set from aunt joan another strategy is to encourage them to sell the toys they no longer play with either online or at a garage sale and keep the proceeds for themselves once the toys have been pared down ms roberson swears by clear shoe or sweater drawers for storage they are stackable they have dividers are easy to clean easy to label and they come in four different sizes she said to help maintain order label where each toy goes said ms lowenheim who recommends installing a tall bookcase and putting paints jigsaw puzzles and other games that tend to leave a mess on the highest shelf if your child is too young to read label the containers with stickers or pictures if everything has a home to return to at the end of the day she said cleanup will be easier and that junk drawer don t waste your time standing over the drawer sifting through it piece by piece ms roberson said dump everything onto the floor or countertop divide it into piles and then ask yourself do i want it does it work does it need to be in the junk drawer if not where else could it go take it easy and go pile by pile she said put things where they belong like that miniature tube of toothpaste you got from the dentist that should go in your toiletries bag and discard things you don t need like old keys and expired batteries and coupons to ward off atrophy buy a drawer organizer suggested ms lowenheim who uses expandable drawer organizers from staples in her own home the key thing is to measure the drawer then find the organizer that best fits the space she said if it s too small it won t help the reward keeping everything sorted by type she said will make it easier for you to find something when you need it ',\n",
       " 'jerusalem israeli police investigators questioned prime minister benjamin netanyahu for three hours at his official residence on monday evening on suspicion of receiving illicit gifts and favors from business executives mr netanyahu was questioned under caution the police said in a statement implying that there were grounds to suspect that mr netanyahu might have committed a criminal offense no further details can be given at this stage the statement added the ministry of justice said late monday that mr netanyahu had been questioned by investigators from lahav 433 a police fraud investigation and prosecution unit with the authorization of the attorney general avichai mandelblit in a detailed statement the ministry described how the police had gathered testimony from dozens of witnesses some abroad and seized documents during a monthslong graft inquiry while some aspects of the inquiry did not yield evidence of crimes the statement said other parts warranted a deeper investigation mr netanyahu who has been subject to police inquiries and investigations in the past that ended without charges has vehemently denied any impropriety this will all come to nothing because there is nothing he has said repeatedly of the latest accusations local news outlets say the investigators are focused on two separate cases one more serious than the other but they have offered little detail on the more serious one the less weighty one according to reports in the newspaper haaretz and other outlets concerns favors for mr netanyahu and possibly for members of his family given by israeli and foreign business executives the israeli police took testimony from ronald s lauder a conservative american businessman and philanthropist and a close friend of mr netanyahu s when he came to israel in late september to attend the funeral of shimon peres the former prime minister and president upon mr lauder s arrival in israel he was asked to meet with the israeli police and respond to questions related to an investigation to which mr lauder is not a party helena beilin a tel lawyer representing mr lauder said in a statement after a short meeting the following day he was told that his presence was no longer needed and that there would be no need for additional meetings this remains the case mr netanyahu s office suggesting that he is the victim of a witch hunt issued a statement over the weekend berating the news organizations for what it described as premature and politically motivated reports try to replace the prime minister at the ballot boxes as is accepted in democracies it added in televised remarks on monday afternoon mr netanyahu told legislators from his conservative likud party in parliament we hear the celebratory spirit and winds blowing through the television studios and in the corridors of the opposition hold off the celebrations don t rush he added i ve told you before and will tell you again this will come to nothing because there is nothing mr netanyahu is serving his third consecutive term in office and his fourth over all he has exuded confidence lately lashing out at journalists who have been critical of him talking up israel s diplomatic and economic achievements and calling in the united states ambassador to israel daniel b shapiro for a dressing down late last month after the obama administration decided not to use its veto to shield israel from a united nations security council resolution that condemned israeli settlement construction in the occupied west bank and east jerusalem mr netanyahu generally a popular prime minister has developed a combative relationship with the local mainstream news media after years of tension with the obama administration he also appears buoyed by the prospect of a partnership with donald j trump who seems more sympathetic to israeli government policies on issues like settlements for mr netanyahu s opponents the prospect of a possible indictment has provided a glimmer of hope even though elections are not scheduled until late 2019 this creates an unusual dynamic in israeli politics said nahum barnea a political columnist for the newspaper yedioth ahronoth and a critic of mr netanyahu on the one hand mr barnea said there were already signs that netanyahu loyalists would try to promote legislation banning investigations of sitting prime ministers on the other he said the question of who might succeed mr netanyahu who has no natural heir in his party was bound to be raised opposition leaders were fairly subdued in their initial response isaac herzog the leader of the zionist union and of the opposition in parliament said it was a tough day for israel when a prime minister is under investigation he added we are not expressing satisfaction at another s misfortune mr herzog has also been the subject of police investigations over campaign funding yair lapid the leader of the centrist yesh atid party which has challenged likud in recent polls said the presumption of innocence applies to every israeli including the prime minister he called for a swift investigation for the sake of the country saying a person who is being investigated is a person under pressure israeli prime ministers are not obligated to step down while under investigation unless they are charged with a crime nonetheless the accusations could chip away at mr netanyahu s standing his predecessor ehud olmert was forced from power in 2008 under the weight of police investigations and accusations of corruption although he remained in office as a caretaker prime minister until early elections could be held in 2009 in february mr olmert became the first former israeli prime minister to enter prison he is serving a term for bribery and obstruction of justice mr netanyahu described mr olmert in 2008 as a prime minister up to his neck in investigations and said he could not be trusted to make fateful decisions under the circumstances because they might be based on personal rather than national interests since the 1990s mr netanyahu s political career has been dogged by inquiries into his conduct and that of people around him though no charges have been filed against him the inquiries have ranged from scandals involving travel expenses and garden furniture the netanyahus were suspected of having switched a new set bought for the prime minister s official residence with an identical old set in their private home in caesarea to a more recent one involving a deal with germany for the acquisition of submarines that agreement came under scrutiny after it became known that mr netanyahu s personal lawyer also represents the israeli agent of the german shipyard that builds the submarines and other naval equipment purchased by israel giving rise to suspicion of a conflict of interest in that episode too mr netanyahu and the lawyer david shimron have denied any wrongdoing mr netanyahu s relationship with arnaud mimran a french tycoon who was convicted of fraud last year and who testified that he had contributed a large sum of money to mr netanyahu for his 2009 election campaign has also prompted suspicions of impropriety ',\n",

youngsters are often introduced to the game in summer camp or by friends from their synagogue and end up playing in one of the many youth leagues that have cropped up in orthodox neighborhoods before joining teams in middle school in some new jersey yeshivas floor hockey is more popular than basketball said yoni stone the varsity coach at the yeshiva university high school for boys forget high school every single day school has a team and the kids start in the youth leagues players abiding by their religious tenets use the sport as an outlet between long hours spent studying judaic texts and other subjects since they observe the sabbath there is no play on friday evenings or saturdays before sundown the season runs from late october through march on a weeknight last month the lions made their dramatic pregame entrance to blaring rock music they were there to take on the cobras from the rae kushner yeshiva high school in livingston n j a school financed by the family of jared kushner the of donald j trump mr kushner himself was proficient at the sport having played for the frisch school in paramus n j when he was a teenager the cobras wound up beating the lions a fatiguing feat since the ball rarely escapes the playing area making for almost nonstop action each game has three periods with each period lasting 12 minutes in fact the team from the ramaz school on manhattan s upper east side prepared to play at the lions gym by having one of its players a senior training to enter the israeli army put his teammates through rigorous military exercises the ramaz school holds games in a modern brightly lit gym that is a far cry from the lions den one night last month the rams of ramaz took on the visiting thunder from the rav teitz mesivta academy or r t m a from elizabeth n j and won the game in overtime prompting a celebratory mob of ramaz players at certain powerhouses hockey is perhaps the most prominent sport and rivalries have developed between neighboring yeshivas in brooklyn the games can be particularly intense whenever the magen david yeshivah or the yeshivah of flatbush both in midwood or the yeshivat darche eres in sheepshead bay face off they re seeing all these kids in synagogue the next day so that creates a certain competitiveness mr stone said when rivals in the five towns section of long island play the whole town shuts down for games that can attract hundreds of spectators said david kolb a hockey writer for msg networks and the operator of camp dovid a summer hockey camp in pennsylvania where campers wear the names of their yeshivas on their jerseys two top teams in the five towns the hebrew academy of the five towns and rockaway and the d r s yeshiva high school for boys have nurtured a rivalry and in the league final in 2014 when the hebrew academy finally avenged years of losses with a victory you would have thought the messiah had come said seth gordon the hockey commissioner for the metropolitan yeshiva high school athletic league some of these rivalries start in elementary school with the seeds planted when these kids are in sixth grade mr gordon said though the sport has drawn a loyal and passionate following the athletes are ultimately religious students who are urged to put their spiritual priorities before their athletic ones it s common with the jewish identity that we can t do certain things because of the boundaries of observant jewish life so we create our own parameters and do it to the fullest mr gavarin said mayer schiller a hasidic rabbi who in the 1990s coached yeshiva university high school to six consecutive league championships is recognized as the progenitor of the yeshiva floor hockey scene he was hard to miss since he coached wearing his black hat and coat rabbi schiller 65 still an avid fan of rock pop and punk music established the now popular tradition of having players enter the gym to loud music the rabbi s choice the ramones he grew up playing roller hockey in queens in the late 1970s with new york s professional basketball teams sagging students began rooting for two local hockey teams the rangers and the islanders rabbi schiller recalled rabbi schiller was a devout rangers fan who was particularly fond of the raucous play of nick fotiu a native of staten island who became a brawler for the rangers the rabbi formed a team at the ramaz school in 1979 and helped organize a fledgling yeshiva hockey league with a teams that grew significantly over the years he regarded coaching as a form of spiritual service and striving at sports as a complement to studying sacred texts and worshiping god if god didn t mean for this greatness to exist why did he give us gretzky and jordan rabbi schiller said on a recent weeknight the s a r team which includes mr kolb s two sons gordie and henri was put through drills and scrimmaging by its longtime head coach howie falkenstein mr falkenstein also runs a hockey program at the westchester summer day camp in mamaroneck n y and a league in the bronx that attracts players from across the region its youngest level is the mites division which is open to first and second graders mr falkenstein was getting his team ready for its game against the frisch school and had players practicing penalty shots gordie the s a r sting s captain deftly scored on his brother a goalie prompting a chorus of hoots from teammates s a r wound up beating frisch solidifying its status as one of the league s top teams it s definitely its own niche but it s still hockey and it has the team

       " 'writers are different from the rest of us their castoff scraps can be worth money not to mention the obsessive attentions of future scholars jonathan lethem 52 recently became the latest author to sell his personal paper trail to a major archive the beinecke rare book manuscript library at yale university acquired a trove of his manuscripts letters notes and other artifacts which will now sit alongside material from walt whitman sinclair lewis james baldwin and marilynne robinson in its rich american literature collection mr lethem s papers contain items relating to the novels that made him something of a reluctant patron saint of brooklyn s literary ascendance including motherless brooklyn 1999 and the fortress of solitude 2003 but as befits a lifelong collector music obsessive comics geek and dedicated chronicler of underground culture there are also cartoons new york 1970s ephemera and what is surely the largest cache of drawings of vomiting cats in any university collection for an author who is so much fun as a novelist it s interesting to see there is so much fun in his archival documents as well said melissa barton the curator of american prose and drama at the beinecke ms barton citing library policy declined to say what yale paid in the sale which was arranged by the manhattan book dealer glenn horowitz mr lethem s archive also includes two computer hard drives a laptop and other digital materials especially from more recent years you can feel the evaporation of the physical ephemera mr lethem whose most recent novel a gambler s anatomy appeared in october said in an interview but the bulk of the collection consists of artifacts some of them charmingly weird we asked mr lethem who left new york in 2010 to teach creative writing at pomona college in claremont calif about some of the odder items in his literary closet the archive includes a number of comic books mr lethem made as a child featuring invented superheroes like man whose origin story included an attempt to start a nudist colony in alaska in one installment man who later got a passing in the fortress of solitude battled ed koch who was no hero to mr lethem s bohemian parents i didn t make multiple copies to sell or anything he said it was more like i was collecting my own weird artifacts from a pretend universe where man was a real comic mr lethem swiped this sticker after stumbling on a shoot for the 1979 movie the warriors in the subway station in brooklyn which was standing in for the times square station this was my subway stop and the fact that they were turning it into 42nd street seemed absurd mr lethem recalled i remember thinking that no one would see or hear about this movie nothing that anyone was shooting in my neighborhood could possibly be important the archive contains typescripts of his novels often affixed with alternate titles would motherless brooklyn have been a hit if it had been called jerks from nowhere the earliest is apes in the plan an unpublished fake philip k dick novel as mr lethem put it named for a devo lyric and written between ages 18 and 23 i wrote three novels on an electric typewriter he said if i live long enough i could end up being one of the last living humans who can say that this diary tracking his writing progress social interactions exercise and um digestion comes from the when mr lethem had dropped out of bennington college and moved to berkeley calif to try to become a writer i had thrust myself into a kind of vacuum he said i had no visible means of support nor was anyone expecting to hear from me this kind of weird probably had to do with externalizing my superego and answering the question who are you and what did you actually do today about those drawings of vomiting cats for about 15 years every time i had a really good dance party that went late with people lolling around drunk and exhausted at about 2 a m i would hand out paper and ask everyone to draw a vomiting cat mr lethem said i ended up with an incredibly thick file of drawings some by people who went on to be published cartoonists and writers some of the goofy character names in mr lethem s novels are drawn from lists he typed up early in his career a habit he connects with the wordplay of motherless brooklyn whose narrator has tourette s syndrome mr lethem recalled a moment of recognition sparked by an oliver sacks essay about a surgeon with tourette s who kept a list of more than 200 unusual names as candy for the mind he was collecting real names mr lethem said but when i read that i thought oh my god that s me names from this list showed up in gun with occasional music 1994 and chronic city 2009 the fortress of solitude inspired by mr lethem s brooklyn childhood describes a store called samuel j underberg a site of mysterious life where graffiti artists came to buy ink that was specially formulated for stamping prices on slimy packages of meat and therefore ideal for tagging while writing mr lethem acquired some random items from the real underberg s now demolished which are shown here with a 1978 billboard hot 100 list an old calendar and other research materials i became a collector of all this tawdry used signage he said i just thought it was really weird and cool the archive contains dozens of letters from fellow writers and artists including donna tartt paul auster suzanne vega jennifer egan thomas berger and ursula k le guin this missive written on an airline safety card is from the novelist david bowman who died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 2012 all his letters were

       " 'washington it was supposed to be a triumphant morning for republicans on capitol hill a moment to demonstrate the merits of unified party rule in the age of donald j trump by noon party leaders had a message for their charges it was not going smoothly the day after house republicans voted to eliminate an independent ethics body members returned to work on tuesday to find their offices inundated with angry missives from constituents amid a national uproar by midmorning mr trump had weighed in questioning the members priorities on twitter shortly after lawmakers were summoned to the basement of the capitol for a hastily convened meeting with republican leaders representative kevin mccarthy of california the majority leader who along with speaker paul d ryan had opposed the proposal lobbed a pointed question at his fellow republicans according to two people present had they campaigned on repealing the affordable care act or tinkering with an ethics office minutes later members emerged to say the changes had been scrapped the reversal came less than 24 hours after house republicans meeting in a secret session voted to curtail the powers of the office of congressional ethics an independent body created in 2008 after a series of scandals involving house lawmakers including three who were sent to jail it was part of a turbulent opening for the trump era in washington marked by a republican push in the senate to repeal the affordable care act house republicans led by representative robert w goodlatte of virginia had sought on monday to prevent the office from pursuing investigations that might result in criminal charges instead they wanted to allow lawmakers on the more powerful house ethics committee to shut down inquiries they even sought to block the small staff at the office of congressional ethics which would have been renamed and put under the oversight of house lawmakers from speaking to the news media it has damaged or destroyed a lot of political careers in this place and it s cost members of congress millions of dollars to defend themselves against anonymous allegations representative steve king republican of iowa said tuesday still defending the move but such resolve crumbled tuesday morning as thousands of phone calls flooded lawmakers offices and both conservative and liberal ethics groups issued statements condemning the vote some republicans joined in saying the measure sent the wrong message to the public internet searches for the words who is my representative surged after news of the plan broke monday night and peaked tuesday morning according to google it was a stumble said representative mark sanford republican of south carolina who opposed the measure and who was himself the subject of an ethics investigation while he was governor of south carolina probably not the way you want to start out mr trump had weighed in via a series of twitter posts suggesting that the house should be focused on domestic policy priorities such as health care and a tax overhaul he called the office of congressional ethics unfair but said focusing on it now was a case of misplaced priorities he appended the hashtag dts an apparent allusion to his promise to drain the swamp in washington mr ryan and mr mccarthy had made clear on monday that they too were opposed to the change but amid boxes of pizza at a house office building with the rose bowl playing on a nearby television several members voiced support for the maneuver including representative steve pearce of new mexico whose office employed an aide who was ensnared in an ethics inquiry but later cleared at first on tuesday morning mr ryan and mr mccarthy played down the changes mr mccarthy suggested that he and mr ryan did not have the power to simply order other republicans to take their advice welcome back he joked referring to the start of the new session of congress on tuesday even at home he said i usually don t win what we watch on tv about an hour later before new members of congress were to be sworn in the point when the house adopts new rules that will govern how it conducts itself during the session mr mccarthy told his fellow republicans that they needed to reverse themselves quickly or potentially face an even more embarrassing revolt on the house floor by his estimation he told them the provision was going to be removed one way or another this was not the first time that house lawmakers democrats or republicans had tried to curtail the powers or budget of the office of congressional ethics which some lawmakers see as being too aggressive in its investigations even though it is routinely cheered by nonprofit ethics groups on both the left and the right perhaps most prominently in 2011 representative melvin watt a north carolina democrat who later left congress to join the obama administration tried to cut the agency s budget by 40 percent a proposal that failed on a vote the house ethics committee the only body that has the power to actually punish lawmakers also frequently clashed with the office which serves more as a grand jury that investigates allegations and issues findings to the ethics committee of probable cause of misdeeds for example the committee tried in 2015 to force the office of congressional ethics to shut down its investigation into allegations that nine house lawmakers trips to azerbaijan in 2013 had been improperly paid for in part by a foreign government entity some of the lawmakers also accepted improper gifts during the trips including rugs and crystal the office of congressional ethics refused to shut down its inquiry and it published its findings on its own after the ethics committee voted to clear the lawmakers of wrongdoing although the committee urged them to return the gifts house rules require the ethics committee to act on recommendations by the office of congressional ethics within 90 days with the expectation that it will either formally clear the targeted lawmakers or create investigative committees to determine if rules or laws have been violated but in recent years the committee has increasingly relied on a loophole that allows it to informally continue to review allegations without closing a case a step it has taken in 21 of the 68 cases referred since 2009 most frequently that means an end to the matter at least as far as the public is aware even though the ethics committee never formally announces that it has closed the investigation as of this week cases in such a limbo include allegations against representatives mark meadows republican of north carolina roger williams republican of texas markwayne mullin republican of oklahoma cathy mcmorris rodgers republican of washington bobby l rush democrat of illinois and luis v gutiérrez democrat of illinois after their reversal on tuesday house republicans agreed to ask the ethics committee to examine the office of congressional ethics and recommend possible changes by this summer to address the concerns that some members have raised mr goodlatte who is chairman of the house judiciary committee defended his proposal and called the reporting about it inaccurate gross misrepresentation by opponents of my amendment and the media willing to go along with this agenda resulted in a flurry of misconceptions and unfounded claims about the true purpose of this amendment he said in a statement but mr goodlatte s critics said he had simply been caught trying to sneak through a favor to help protect his fellow lawmakers we re glad that the house republicans listened to the public outrage about this proposal and came to their senses to reverse it and not end real ethics enforcement in congress noah bookbinder executive director of the liberal watchdog

       " 'washington the congress opened the turbulent trump era in washington on tuesday as the new senate moved instantly to begin the repeal of president obama s signature health care law while the house descended into chaos in an attempt to gut an independent congressional ethics office on a day usually reserved for pomp constitutionally mandated procedure and small children parading around in fancy dresses congress instead pitched itself into partisan battles speaker paul d ryan easily won but not before the embarrassment of having his members defy him by voting to eliminate the ethics office only to then abandon that effort after a flood of criticism from constituents and twitter messages from donald j trump that criticized house republican priorities it was a rocky start to a period in which republicans had promised an end to washington gridlock if they controlled both congress and the white house there was intraparty conflict and a sense that mr trump who ran against the republican establishment would continue to be openly critical of his own party at times as democrats in both chambers seethed senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky the majority leader unveiled the legislative language that could decimate the affordable care act before the crocuses start to bloom in the spring even if any replacement of the law could take years budget language released on tuesday gives house and senate committees only until jan 27 to produce legislation that would eliminate major parts of the health care law under arcane budget procedures that legislation would be protected from a democratic filibuster and could pass the senate with a simple majority and debate will begin on wednesday before senators have even moved into their new offices the dueling over the health law s fate will pull in both the departing and incoming white house administrations as well on wednesday mr obama will visit with congressional democrats to plot how to resist the planned repeal and mike pence the vice will meet with republicans to gird them for the fight ahead while the senate action showed republicans on course to keep campaign promises the house got off to a messy start brought on by republicans who had moved largely in secret on monday to gut a congressional ethics office against mr ryan s wishes that provoked an outcry from both democrats and voters who flooded house offices with angry calls every organization is calling my office said representative pete sessions republican of texas and we ve told them thank you very much we appreciate your feedback after a hastily called meeting on tuesday morning among republicans the matter was dropped before it could go to the full house floor for a vote as the senate moved to larger legislative matters the house kerfuffle seemed to cast a shadow over mr ryan but he tried to brush it off there s no sense of foreboding in the house today mr ryan said after his only the sense of potential the fight over the house rules was already acrimonious thanks to a piece of the package that would impose 2 500 in fines for filming events on the house floor a response to democrats who streamed their overnight over guns last june using cellphones and video cameras in the senate vice president joseph r biden jr swore in seven new members and all the incumbents who won their races last year their colleagues

uncomfortable lacy hems as well as former senators and other special guests former vice president dick cheney accompanied his daughter liz to her as a member of the house elected from wyoming senator chuck schumer of new york officially became the democratic leader and quickly warned republicans that the minority would be vocal if not operatic in resisting much of their agenda and many of mr trump

closing the carried interest loophole for instance we will work in good faith to perfect and potentially enact it when he doesn t we will resist he added if trump lets the members of congress and his cabinet run the show if he adopts their timeworn policies which benefit the elites the special interests and corporate america not the working man and woman his presidency will not succeed on tuesday the house also adopted rules clearing the way for legislation to roll back the health care law the budget blueprint introduced on tuesday in the senate is not sent to the president and does not become law but still clears the way for subsequent legislation that republicans say will repeal major provisions of the affordable care act republicans bypassed the budget committee so they could immediately bring the measure to the floor such resolutions are normally developed after weeks of work in the budget committee under the plan four congressional committees two in the house and two in the senate have until jan 27 to develop legislation that will be the vehicle for repealing the health care law the document does not specify which provisions of the law may be eliminated and which ones may be preserved nor does it specify or even suggest how republicans would replace the affordable care act which the obama administration says has provided coverage to some 20 million people who were previously uninsured republicans have said they may delay the effective date of a repeal bill to avoid disrupting coverage for people who have it and to provide time for republicans to develop alternatives to the 2010 health law the budget blueprint allows republicans to use savings from repealing major provisions of that law to help offset the cost of future unspecified measures to help people obtain coverage americans face skyrocketing premiums and soaring deductibles said senator mike enzi republican of wyoming and chairman of the senate budget committee insurers are withdrawing from markets across the country leaving many families with fewer choices and less access to care than they had before the opposite of what the law promised the american medical association urged congress on tuesday to explain how it would replace the affordable care act before any action is taken through reconciliation or other means that would potentially alter coverage policy makers should lay out for the american people in reasonable detail what will replace current policies the chief executive of the association dr james l madara said in a letter to congressional leaders representative nancy pelosi of california who engineered the house passage of the health law in 2010 promised this week that democrats would be just as aggressive in fighting its repeal republicans have said they may delay legislation to replace the health law for several years ms pelosi said that such a delay would be an act of cowardice on the part of republicans and that they don t even have the votes to do it because they have not agreed on a replacement plan democrats also vowed to give mr trump s cabinet nominees rigorous scrutiny senator dianne feinstein of california the democrat on

of the north american free trade agreement with mexico and canada we wanted him to know that we ll work with him on doing that mr trumka said i don t think he has enough republican support to do it and rewriting the rules of trade is a necessary first step in righting the economy for working people mr trump and his top advisers on trade including mr lighthizer share a view that the united states in recent decades prioritized the ideal of free trade over its own they argue that other countries are undermining america s industrial base by subsidizing their own export industries while impeding

american steel producers in their frequent litigation of trade disputes mr trump is seeking to hire one of washington s top trade lawyers to enforce international trade agreements more vigorously he

hatch of utah the chairman of the senate finance committee which will hold hearings on mr lighthizer s nomination issued a cautiously supportive statement tuesday as the world and our economic competitors move to expand their global footprints we can t afford to be left behind in securing strong deals that will increase our access to new markets for products and services mr hatch said in a statement i look forward to a vigorous discussion of bob s trade philosophy and priorities mr trump has named a number of advisers on trade leaving some ambiguity about the division of responsibilities the named the economist peter navarro an outspoken critic of china to lead a new white house office overseeing trade and industrial policy mr trump also said wilbur ross the billionaire investor and choice for commerce secretary will play a key role mr lighthizer however is the only member of the triumvirate with government experience those who say u s t r will be subordinated to other agencies are mistaken said alan wolff another former senior american trade official who was the steel industry s on trade with mr lighthizer for nearly 20 years citing mr lighthizer s encyclopedic knowledge of trade law he ll be a dominant figure on trade in harmony with wilbur ross and navarro there is also an ideological divide between the people mr trump has named

council rex w tillerson the chief executive of exxon mobil tapped for secretary of state and gov terry branstad of iowa mr trump s choice for ambassador to china proponents of trade hope the broader circle and congressional republicans will exert a moderating influence you re seeing a pretty clear indication that there will be a focus on the enforcement of our trade agreements and on the letter of the law said scott lincicome an international trade lawyer at white case but that doesn t necessarily mean a significant turn toward protectionism even free trade guys like me support enforcement trade opponents on the left and the right meanwhile are hoping mr trump means to break with several decades of policy there s going to be a war within the trump administration on where they go with trade and we re hoping to energize the worker base he had to make sure they go in the right direction to benefit the american worker mr trumka said mr trump s promise to immediately designate china as a currency manipulator may offer an early test of the administration s intentions economists see no evidence china is suppressing the value of its currency although it has done so in the past mr lincicome said officially labeling china a currency manipulator despite the lack of recent evidence would signal that the administration is taking a hard line on trade issues a broader shift in trade policy would unfold more slowly mr trump has promised to renegotiate nafta the original process took most of three years he has promised to pursue enforcement actions against other nations but it takes time to mount cases he has threatened to impose new tariffs on imports but sweeping changes most likely would require congressional legislation mr trump already is seeking to exert influence by

united states trade representative in the ronald reagan administration when he was involved in pressing japan to reduce its restrictions on american imports and its subsidies for its own exports mr trump has criticized china for similar practices setting the stage for a new round of confrontations reagan is often remembered as an advocate for free trade but his administration in its early hours imposed a quota on japanese auto imports it was the first in a long series of measures aimed at putting pressure on the nation that was then regarded like china in recent years as a threat to american prosperity president reagan s pragmatism contrasted strongly with the utopian dreams of free traders mr lighthizer wrote in a 2008 piece criticizing senator john mccain republican of arizona for embracing unbridled free trade conservatives he argued always understood that trade policy was merely a tool for building a strong and independent country with a prosperous middle class ',\n",
       " ' donald j trump appears to side with the wikileaks founder julian assange over united states intelligence agencies with vice mike pence backing him up she s hired omarosa manigault gets a white house post as do some notable trump loyalists but mr trump is leaning on republican veterans in the oval office s top slots the finds something very strange about his intelligence briefing on friday even though the white house says it was always planned for friday for the republican party mr assange the wikileaks founder was once purely a villain he found little sympathy with conservatives after he leaked american military secrets from iraq published purloined diplomatic cables that could have gotten american sources killed and sought refuge in the ecuadorean embassy in london fleeing charges of rape but now mr trump appears to be siding with mr assange over the conclusions of america s intelligence services mr assange appeared on fox news on tuesday night with sean hannity one of mr trump s biggest news media boosters to declare once again that the russians were not the source of the purloined emails that wikileaks released from the democratic national committee and the personal account of hillary clinton s campaign chairman john podesta mr trump followed that appearance with a series of twitter posts on wednesday that appeared to be preparing his followers for battle once more information on intelligence findings was released most likely by thursday there were actually two separate hackings that the obama administration has said came from russian intelligence with 100 percent certainty as he has previously mr assange said our source is not the russian government it is not state parties but mr assange has often said that the organization does not always know the identity of its sources it is highly unlikely that anyone approaching wikileaks with the emails obtained by russian government hacking would acknowledge the source so it is likely that mr assange cannot be sure of the origin of the emails mr assange and mr hannity did not address that in addition to wikileaks the leaked democratic material was published by two mysterious websites dcleaks com and a blog written by someone called guccifer 2 0 american intelligence agencies say they believe both were created by russian agents in addition to american intelligence agencies most private researchers also say they believe that the d n c and podesta hackings were carried out on orders of russian government officials though a few skeptics say they believe the case is unproven by the evidence made public mr assange s statement is unlikely to change that conclusion intelligence officials will brief congress on their russia inquiry on thursday ahead of a briefing for mr trump in new york on friday senator john mccain of arizona chairman of the senate armed services committee will hold the first hearing on the matter on thursday as well as for that terrible information mentioned by mr trump the cnn commentator donna brazile did send mr podesta an email ahead of a democratic presidential debate in flint mich tipping him off that a woman in the audience would ask why the government was not doing more to help clean the city s water supply that was in fact reported widely and often here and here and here and here among other places and that was hardly an unexpected query for mrs clinton or for her rival senator bernie sanders of vermont it did cause ms brazile to lose her cnn post the appears to be getting a jump on the news vice mike pence defended mr trump s assange posts at a capitol hill news conference wednesday effectively doubling down on the incoming administration s icy blasts toward united states intelligence mr trump expressed his very sincere and healthy american skepticism about intelligence conclusions mr pence said with house republican leaders by his side mr trump s remarks have again placed fellow republicans in an uncomfortable position asked on wednesday morning about the twitter post speaker paul d ryan steered clear of criticizing the saying he would not be commenting on every little tweet or facebook post but he called mr assange a sycophant for russia who leaks steals data and compromises national security mr ryan noted that mr trump had not yet received his latest briefing on russia hopefully he ll get up to speed on what s been happening and what russia has or has not done he said ms manigault the villain and diva from mr trump s reality television show the apprentice was officially named assistant to the president and director of communications for the white house office of public liaison one of a slate of wednesday appointments that went to ardent trump loyalists the appointments include bill stepien a confidant of gov chris christie of new jersey and a figure in the bridgegate scandal who will be white house political director keith schiller who was head of private security at mr trump s real estate company will be director of oval office operations john destefano a longtime aide to former house speaker john a boehner will direct presidential personnel and george gigicos who organized those giant campaign rallies will be director of advance a further indicator that mr trump plans to continue that sort of thing as president but for star power no one is going to beat ms manigault ms manigault aside mr trump is turning to some seasoned veterans to run key operations in his white house mr trump announced on wednesday that he had selected joe hagin who served for 14 years in the white house under roanld reagan george bush and george w bush as his deputy chief of staff for operations a key post in which he will be responsible for organizing presidential trips and security among other things he named rick dearborn who has 25 years of experience on capitol hill as his chief liaison to congress heading the office of legislative affairs as well as the office of intergovernmental affairs and cabinet affairs katie walsh who was chief of staff at the republican national committee under reince priebus mr trump s incoming chief of staff will become his deputy at the white house overseeing senior staff scheduling and the office of public liaison in a statement mr priebus called the three a team of doers who would fill critical roles kellyanne conway who served as counselor to mr trump said she was thrilled to have another strong female leader on the team in ms walsh first mr trump said that the nation should move beyond talk of russian interference in the presidential election but that he would listen to what american intelligence experts had to say then on new year s eve the promised that by tuesday or wednesday he would reveal information on the hacking that americans do not know and now he seems to think the intelligence community has not quite gotten its story straight the obama administration quickly let it be known that in fact intelligence leaders always intended to brief mr trump on friday in new york and intelligence officials were not amused nor were some republican political consultants but this is not the first time the has taken a swipe at the intelligence community which has concluded that russia tried to help get him elected president president obama is on capitol hill on wednesday to plot a strategy to save his signature domestic achievement the affordable care act vice mike pence countered with his own visit to congressional republicans the first order of business is to repeal and replace obamacare mr pence said it needs to be done and mr trump weighed in on twitter trying to stiffen republican spines as democrats press their point that a fast gutting of the law will endanger the health care of 20 million people covered under the law and put at risk tens of millions more with health problems schumer clowns may not be an olive branch to senator chuck schumer of new york the new minority leader but it is a signal that the incoming president is ready for war over health care republicans should stop clowning around with americans medicare medicaid and health care mr schumer responded after meeting with the president he warned that republicans would throw the entire health care system into chaos representative nancy pelosi of california the house minority leader tried to coin a phrase make america sick again is that what republicans want the trump transition office named the lawyer jay clayton to be the next chairman of the securities and exchange commission the last time mr trump held a real news conference was on july 27 when he said president vladimir v putin of russia had called him a genius and wrongly insisted that many people saw bombs strewn all over the floor of the san bernardino calif attackers home and failed to report it that long stretch without a real news media grilling did not do him much harm he did after all win the election but he says he will hold a

       " 'jerusalem the fate of just one israeli soldier was hanging in the balance but for many israelis the guilty verdict announced on wednesday was a critical turn in the battle for the character of the state when the military judges convicted sgt elor azaria of manslaughter for shooting a palestinian assailant in the head as he lay wounded on the ground they were ruling not just on his conduct but also on the host of ethical and political issues it raised since the shooting in the occupied west bank city of hebron in march the case has polarized israelis and rocked the pedestal on which the military normally stands with the 50th anniversary of israel s occupation of the west bank approaching the highly charged trial had fueled a debate about military ethics and the place of the army in israeli society the verdict did little to heal the rifts the trial had exposed hours after it was rendered prime minister benjamin netanyahu joined a chorus of voices calling for the soldier to be pardoned this is a difficult and painful day for us all mr netanyahu said in a facebook post supporting a pardon which can be granted by israel s president or the army s top officials referring to the israel defense forces he added the soldiers of the i d f are our sons and daughters and they need to remain above any dispute prof david enoch an expert in the philosophy of law at the hebrew university of jerusalem said he thought the manslaughter conviction was justified but added i m not sure this verdict will be welcomed by many of the soldiers and much of the public the military s rules make clear that assailants must be quickly incapacitated but that once the threat is neutralized they should not be killed rights groups and other critics have accused israeli soldiers and police officers of being too quick to pull the trigger particularly in response to a recent spate of deadly stabbings shootings and car attacks by palestinians the hebron killing caught in chilling completeness in a video that quickly went viral worldwide for many critics crystallized the question of excessive force and even military leaders said sergeant azaria acted without justification but in israel a country where military service is a part of national identity many jews called for backing up young soldiers sent on dangerous missions and said that sergeant azaria had been in an impossible situation and had little chance of an acquittal since that would have put his commanders in a bad light israel s defense minister avigdor lieberman called wednesday s decision a tough verdict the first thing i ask of all of us those who like the verdict and those like me who like it much less we are all obligated to respect the court s decision mr lieberman said we are obligated to maintain restraint mr lieberman as a member of the parliamentary opposition before his cabinet appointment had attended the military court to support sergeant azaria and called the legal proceedings a theater of the absurd but on wednesday he said we must keep the army above and beyond all political argument politicians to mr netanyahu s right and left have also called for a pardon including the education minister naftali bennett and shelly yacimovich of the labor party who said that azaria s shoulders are too narrow to bear the entire weight of the fissure the case has exposed some israeli experts compared the azaria verdict to the kafr qassem ruling of more than 60 years ago after border police officers fatally shot 49 arab men women and children as they returned from work in the fields unwittingly breaking a curfew the murder convictions of officers in that case established that security forces must refuse to follow a patently illegal order that carries a black flag of criminality it helped shape the army s ethos now some fear that in the lower ranks it has begun to erode in a measure of the tensions the verdict was handed down in a special court inside the walled and heavily guarded compound of the military s headquarters in tel aviv rather than in the courtroom where the trial was held to keep demonstrators at bay video footage showed sergeant azaria smiling as he entered the courtroom to applause and he was embraced by his family and friends hundreds of protesters gathered outside the compound shouting slogans like free the boy col maya heller one of the military judges spent more than two and a half hours delivering the verdict she systematically rejected the main points of the defense and said there had been no justification for the shooting according to reports from the courtroom describing sergeant azaria s telling of the event as twisting and evolving the judge said the defense had tried to hold the rope at both ends on one hand it asserted that the victim abed appeared to pose a danger because he was still moving and on the other it brought medical witnesses who contended that he was dead by the time sergeant azaria shot him in the head the judge seemed to give great weight to statements sergeant azaria a medic who was 19 at the time made at the scene indicating he had acted not out of fear but for revenge a soldier testified that before the shooting sergeant azaria had said how is it that my friend was stabbed and the terrorist is still alive after the shooting a commander who was at the scene recalled sergeant azaria saying the terrorist deserved to die ilan katz one of sergeant azaria s lawyers vowed to appeal the military s high command had denounced the shooting immediately after it happened calling it a grave breach of proper military conduct but israeli society was divided against the backdrop of continued palestinian attacks many politicians and celebrities along with jewish parents of soldiers hailed sergeant azaria as a hero mr netanyahu first condemned sergeant azaria s actions then phoned the soldier s family to offer sympathy and reassurances that he would be treated fairly local television stations frequently showed images of sergeant azaria s distraught parents hugging him in court appealing to public sentiment in a country blighted by wars and terrorism and where most jewish are conscripted for up to 32 months of military service his supporters portrayed him as everybody s child in remarks recorded before the verdict the military s chief of staff lt gen gadi eisenkot tried to puncture that narrative an in the israeli army is not everybody s child he said he is a fighter a soldier who must dedicate his life to carry out the tasks we give him we cannot be confused about this the episode began when two palestinian men stabbed and wounded an israeli soldier at a checkpoint in hebron israeli soldiers killed one and wounded the other mr sharif 21 sergeant azaria arrived at the scene about six minutes later the video showed calm had been restored yet 11 minutes after the initial attack he cocked his rifle and shot mr sharif as he lay on the road lawyers representing sergeant azaria said he had acted to save his comrades in the belief that mr sharif who was still moving might have been concealing an explosive belt under his jacket but sergeant azaria did not warn the other soldiers or the medical staff nearby to move away during the trial sergeant azaria s company commander maj tom naaman said he did not feel any danger from mr sharif undercutting

       " 'stuck at your work desk standing up and walking around for five minutes every hour during the workday could lift your mood combat lethargy without reducing focus and attention and even dull hunger pangs according to an instructive new study the study which also found that frequent brief walking breaks were more effective at improving than a single longer walk before work could provide the basis for a simple realistic new year s exercise resolution for those of us bound to our desks all day there is growing evidence of course that long bouts of uninterrupted sitting can have undesirable physical and emotional consequences studies have shown that sitting motionless reduces blood flow to the legs increasing the risk for atherosclerosis the buildup of plaques in the arteries people who sit for more than eight or nine hours daily which for many of us describes a typical workday also are at heightened risk for diabetes depression and obesity compared with people who move more often in response researchers and some bosses have proposed a variety of methods for helping people reduce their sitting time at work including standing workstations and treadmill desks but such options are cumbersome and costly making them impractical for many work situations some experts have worried too that if people are physically active at the office they might subsequently become more tired grumpy distracted or hungry any of which could have an undesirable effect on work performance and health so for the new study which was published in november in the international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity researchers from the university of colorado anschutz medical campus the johnson johnson human performance institute and other institutions decided to test several methods of increasing movement among office workers the study was funded largely by johnson johnson with additional support from the colorado nutrition obesity research center to start the researchers invited 30 sedentary adult office workers to a university clinic to complete a battery of health tests and questionnaires the researchers measured their heart rates and stress hormone levels and asked them to rank on a numerical scale how energetic or tired they felt as well as how happy they were and whether they were feeling peckish or had little appetite just then the volunteers also completed computerized games designed primarily to test their ability to concentrate and make decisions then on three subsequent visits to the clinic each volunteer simulated a workday during one visit the volunteers sat for the whole time with no interruptions except for bathroom breaks during another they walked moderately for 30 minutes at the start of their experimental day and then sat for the next five and a half hours with no additional scheduled breaks finally during a third visit the volunteers sat for most of the six hours but began each hour with five minutes of moderate walking using treadmills at the clinic at the start and end of each session the researchers drew blood to check levels of stress hormones and periodically throughout each day they asked their volunteers to numerically rate their moods energy fatigue and appetites the volunteers also repeated the computerized testing of their thinking skills at the close of each session the researchers then analyzed the data the numbers showed that on almost all measures the subjects ratings of how they were feeling rose when they did not sit for six uninterrupted hours they said that they felt much more energetic throughout the day if they had been active whether that activity was bunched into a single longish walk at the start of the day or distributed into multiple brief breaks on other measures though the walks were more potent than the concentrated version when the workers rose most often they reported greater happiness less fatigue and considerably less craving for food than on either of the other days their feelings of vigor also tended to increase throughout the day while they often had plateaued by early afternoon after walking only once in the morning there were no differences on the scores on the cognitive tests whether they sat all day or got up and moved stress hormones also remained steady during each visit these results suggest that even a little bit of activity spread throughout the day is a practical easy way to improve says jack groppel a study author and a founder of the johnson johnson human performance institute he points out that the walking breaks did not cause people to feel more tired or hungry but instead had the opposite effect they also did not alter people s ability to focus so in theory should not affect productivity for good or ill this study however was small in scale and limited by its dependence on the volunteers perceptions of their responses to the experiment but even so it s clear that moving matters dr groppel says so set your 2017 appointment calendar he suggests to devote five minutes every hour to physical activity whether you walk up and down a staircase along a corridor or just pace around your office ',\n",

news where she was a countervailing presence in an opinion lineup heavy with ideology and of nbc news which has been a longtime bête noire for conservative press critics and it comes as all news organizations gird for a new era of media coverage that arrives jan 20 with the inauguration of donald j trump the murdoch family which controls fox news s parent company 21st century fox had become so invested in ms kelly as a franchise that they were prepared to pay her a salary of more than 20 million a year people inside and outside the network widely took that to mean the murdochs were staking the network s future on a journalist who effectively made her name by upending the expectations for a fox news anchor for instance by publicly taking on the republican nominee for president but now fox news long the cable news ratings leader and an influential voice in the national political debate is on course to begin coverage of a new administration with no anchor with ms kelly s history of challenging mr trump her show the kelly file was sandwiched between the program of bill o reilly she was regularly second to him in the cable news ratings and that of mr trump s major booster sean hannity her departure coming after that of greta van susteren also means that fox faces the prospect of having no female host in prime time that is a potentially troubling development for the network as its seeks to move past last summer s sexual harassment scandal involving its and former chairman roger ailes in which many women described experiencing harassment or intimidation fox is said to be looking at several potential female successors for ms kelly for nbc the addition of ms kelly 46 may help address a challenge confronting many major news organizations connecting with a politically diverse audience in bringing ms kelly to nbc andrew lack the chairman of the news division is adding a journalist schooled in the preferences and worldviews of the conservative americans who helped elect mr trump and whose anger so many news organizations failed to appreciate ms kelly s closely watched career move capped months of drama in the political sphere in which she was often

fox news the statement read we hope she enjoys tremendous success in her career and wish her and her family the best though the loss of ms kelly is a blow to fox news the network has a winning formula that has kept it atop the ratings for many years and helped it to avoid the its rivals experienced in the weeks after election day as the associated press reported and now the nation has a new republican president whose approach speaks to the sensibilities of many of fox s viewers company executives said the murdochs knew ms kelly was a flight risk their offer included keeping her in prime time and she had made it clear she was seeking a job that would give her more time for her family ms kelly had spoken with top executives at abc news cnn and in the syndication industry as well as nbc news but nbc remained largely under the radar as a landing spot one person briefed on ms kelly s deliberations said that mr lack won her over by starting the talks with a question about what she was seeking instead of flatly offering possibilities he then came back with a deal that was tailored to her preferences a daytime show would give her a schedule that would allow her to see her children off to school and to have dinner with them and her husband douglas brunt a novelist people briefed on the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity declined to disclose what ms kelly s new annual salary would be at nbc fox news rivals who sought to hire ms kelly away including nbc news had indicated that they could not match the 20 million offer from fox the cable news leader for the last 15 years running but even a modest raise for ms kelly would place her among television s journalists the wall street journal recently reported she was to collect 15 million for the final year of her

all involved especially the daytime program daytime television has been notoriously difficult for news stars people involved in the discussions said that the program was not planned to be in the mold of a traditional daytime talk show nor much like the special ms kelly hosted last may on the fox broadcast network which drew some harsh criticism some of which ms kelly dismissed as liberal disappointment over a friendly interview with mr trump in an interview with charlie rose on cbs sunday morning last year ms kelly described the television show of her fantasies how about if we merge a little charlie rose a little oprah and a little me all together she said and we serve that up as an hour wouldn t you watch that ms kelly kept a relatively low profile on tuesday addressing her own

       " 'qingyuan china the 48 soccer fields of the vast evergrande football school in south china seem barely enough for its 2 800 students against a backdrop of school spires that seem modeled on hogwarts the young athletes swarm onto the fields nearly every day kicking dribbling and passing in the hope of soccer glory and riches soccer will be my career after i grow up wang kai a gangly who has studied at the boarding school for over three years said after a morning session under the supervision of a spanish coach i want to be the chinese cristiano ronaldo he said referring to the portuguese superstar grooming the next ronaldo or messi has become a national project in china where the country s no 1 fan president xi jinping is bent on transforming the country into a great soccer power it is a moonshot for china whose teams have ranked poor to middling in recent international competition but the effort has already unleashed a surge of spending and support for the game that has stunned fans and players around the world in the last two weeks the main chinese league has plucked foreign stars from europe and south america with contracts reported to be worth as much as 40 million a year the highest pay for any soccer player in the world a chinese club offered the real ronaldo 105 million a year but he declined his agent said last week these giddying sums are shaking the landscape of pro soccer antonio conte the manager of england s fabled chelsea team denounced the chinese spending spree last month as a danger for all teams in the world the drive to match china s economic ascent with success on the soccer field has become emblematic of mr xi s ambition to transform china into a great and confident power my biggest hope for chinese soccer is that its teams become among the world s best he announced in 2015 in the last two years the government has poured the kind of concentrated effort into soccer that it has previously devoted to winning olympic medals in individual sports like diving and gymnastics it has promised to clean up and reorganize professional soccer and build a new generation of players by creating tens of thousands of soccer fields and adding soccer programs in tens of thousands of schools the aim is to establish a flow of top players eventually capable of winning the coveted men s world cup and returning the women s team to its former glory that effort has emboldened chinese clubs to spend lavishly as well as paying tens of millions for foreign players chinese team owners have spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying into european clubs hoping to tap their coaching and marketing expertise current spending has created massive expectations said simon chadwick a professor of sports enterprise at the university of salford in britain spending big on players is also about acquiring heroes and icons but if soccer distills mr xi s national ambitions it also illustrates how his plans could falter as they have in other arenas in a muddle of rushed and distorted enforcement especially at the local level there has been resistance by parents worried about their children taking precious time away from academics as well as fear that splurging on foreign stars diverts money and attention from fostering homegrown talent the pitfalls in fixing soccer it turns out are a bit like those in fixing the economy a desire for quick flashy success is putting goals at risk people s daily the main newspaper of the communist party warned last month of a bubble of reckless spending in chinese professional soccer that could burst and badly damage the sport too many investors had feverish expectations while some clubs officials and schools were only going through the motions of developing young players the newspaper said one of the biggest problems is said cameron wilson a scottish resident of shanghai who edits wild east football a website that follows the sport in china there are these great plans and ideas but when it gets down to the level in the provinces it s like people doing their own thing china s passionate soccer fans would be thrilled to have competitive national teams instead of the lackluster ones they have now the national men s team recently placed 83rd in fifa rankings just ahead of the faroe islands a remote outcrop of denmark with fewer than 50 000 inhabitants and it is unlikely to win a spot in the 2018 world cup the women s team the pride of chinese soccer in past decades has stumbled it was for the women s world cup in 1999 but slipped to 13th in the latest rankings the national team is a joke said xu yun 16 who had come to workers stadium in beijing to watch his favorite beijing team clobber a listless opponent from henan province i think it will need decades to get it right it s not just a question of spending money it s attitude for years the domestic professional game was riddled with corruption brazen even by china s standards since revelations grew into a national scandal in 2009 the worst cheating has been cleaned up it still exists mr wilson said just not so blatantly for xi soccer has been a passion since childhood his trips abroad have included photographs with david beckham and other soccer celebrities in ireland in 2012 he famously had an enthusiastic but seemingly rusty go at kicking a ball in september he revisited his old school in beijing where he learned to kick and became a fan of the game according to memoirs of his former teacher look how healthy i am mr xi told young soccer players at the school i laid the basis for that through sports when i was young private investors have piled into professional soccer encouraged by xi s backing for the game and apparently eager to curry favor with his government in the main pro trading season last year the 16 chinese super league teams spent about 300 million hiring away promising foreign players outstripping player spending by the english premier league by nearly 120 million according to fifa tms a player transfer data company prices in 2017 are likely to go even higher but mr xi s focus is on the long game and the next generation of players his plan calls for 50 000 schools to have a strong emphasis on soccer by 2025 a leap from 5 000 in 2015 the number of soccer fields across the country will grow to over 70 000 by the end of 2020 from under 11 000 by then the plan says 50 million chinese including 30 million students will regularly play soccer now principals at every school are paying quite a bit more attention to soccer said dai wei the athletic director at r xi s old school the bayi school that was unthinkable before yet there is deep cultural resistance even at bayi some parents discourage their children from committing time to sports mr dai said because they have so much homework and face stiff competition on academic exams while china has excelled at individual sports that demand intense discipline from an early age the country has not done as well at fostering group sports where skills like teamwork and improvisation count as much as personal virtuosity the privately run evergrande school the world s biggest soccer boarding school says its formula of intense training combined with a solid education could show the way for developing young players as more soccer schools are built there ll be more and more kids playing and the stars will multiply too said liu jiangnan the principal of the school which opened in 2012 i d guess that in seven or eight years half the members of the chinese national squad will come from this school drawn by such hopes parents pay up to about 8 700 a year to send children here where 24 spanish coaches oversee training students spend 90 minutes a day on drills and also play on weekends promising players get scholarships and children from poorer families get discounts school officials said but even here the children come to the game later than their european and south american counterparts and they often lack solid grounding in teamwork and tactics said sergio zarco diaz a spanish coach the kids are getting better year by year he said hopefully but the evergrande approach is too expensive to be widely copied some schools facing a shortage of coaches and space for fields have devised their own drills like soccer gymnastics in which children stand in lines tossing a ball up down and around it may impress visiting officials but it is scant preparation for the free flow of the game said zhang lu a widely respected soccer commentator chinese soccer has failed before through rushing for instant success mr zhang said in an interview in beijing recalling previous failed efforts to build up the game in the 1980s and 1990s the problem is that everyone s thinking is still deeply set in traditional ideas everyone thinks soccer is just about getting results competition training creating stars mr zhang has instead been encouraging schools to focus on fun and broad participation that approach gives more children a break from the monotony of the classroom and will eventually bring out more future champions than an elitist approach he argues some schools are trying his way on a recent afternoon the smog that often covers beijing lifted and the children of caoqiao elementary school rushed onto the fields shouting and squealing with delight this morning soccer had been canceled because of the smog said the principal lin yanling but at midday i notified the kids that it was back on and they all went crazy with relief ',\n",
       " 'in the technology industry the sharks have never long been safe from the minnows over much of the last 40 years the biggest players in tech from ibm to to cisco to yahoo were eventually outmaneuvered by that came out of nowhere the dynamic is so dependable that it is often taken to be a kind of axiom to grow large in this business is also to grow slow blind and dumb to become closed off from the very sources of innovation that turned you into a shark in the first place then in the last half decade something strange happened the sharks began to get bigger and smarter nearly a year ago i argued that we were witnessing a new era in the tech business one that is typified less by the storied in a garage than by a posse i like to call the frightful five amazon apple facebook microsoft and alphabet google s parent company together the five compose a new superclass of american corporate might for much of last year their further rise and domination over the rest of the global economy looked not just plausible but also maybe even probable in 2017 much the same story remains but there is a new wrinkle the world s governments are newly motivated to take on the tech giants in the united states europe asia and south america the five find themselves increasingly arrayed against legal and regulatory powers and often even against popular will the precise nature of the fights varies by company and region including the tax and antitrust investigations of apple and google in europe and donald j trump s broad and often incoherent criticism of the five for various alleged misdeeds this is the story that will shape the contours of the next great era in tech five huge companies that can only get bigger are set against governments that increasingly see them as a clear threat to governing authority so happy new year let s start with some stats in 2017 the five are bigger than ever as in 2016 they are half of the world s 10 most valuable companies when measured by stock market value their wealth stems from their control of the inescapable digital infrastructure on which much of the rest of the economy depends mobile phones social networks the web the cloud retail and logistics and the data and computing power required for future breakthroughs meanwhile the five are poised to jump beyond their corner of the lagoon over the last few years they have begun to set their sights on the biggest industries outside tech on autos health care retail transportation entertainment and finance the five aren t exactly immune to business cycles apple s sales were flat last year and after a monster 2016 alphabet s stock price hit a plateau the five also aren t entirely safe from competition from and one of the persistent features of the tech industry is that some of the most perilous threats to giants are the hardest to spot still at the moment thanks to smart acquisition strategies and a outlook the five sure do look insulated from competition from today s most valuable tech upstarts like airbnb uber and snap could grow quite huge and still pose little threat to the collective fortunes of the frightful five what has changed is public perception for years most of the five enjoyed broad cultural good will they were portrayed in the news media as forces of innovation and delight as the best that american capitalism had to offer the exceptions were microsoft which reached towering heights through corporate ruthlessness in the 1990s and amazon which got under people s skin for among other things making books cheaper and more widely accessible thereby hurting bookstores but generally people loved tech giants they had gotten huge just the way you re supposed to in america by inventing new stuff that people love and even their worst sins weren t considered that bad they weren t causing environmental disasters they weren t selling cigarettes they weren t bringing the world to economic ruin through dangerous financial shenanigans after i noted the five s growing invincibility last year the biggest pushback i got from people at these companies had to do with the moniker i had given them why hadn t i called them the fabulous five over the last year perception began to change familiarity breeds contempt as technology wormed deeper into our lives it began to feel less like an unalloyed good and more like every other annoyance we have to deal with silicon valley grew cloistered missing people s unease with the speed with which their innovations were changing our lives when apple took on the federal bureau of investigation last year over access to a terrorist s iphone many in tech sided with the company but a majority of americans thought apple should give in during the long presidential campaign mr trump said a lot of things that people in tech found ridiculous he vowed to call on bill gates to help him shut down the parts of the internet that terrorists were using he promised to force apple to make iphones in america he suggested that the washington post was running critical stories about him because its owner jeff bezos was scared that mr trump would pursue antitrust charges against mr bezos s main company amazon few in the tech industry supported mr trump but the industry s antipathy seemed to matter little to the public for years most of the frightful five were given the benefit of the doubt as economic disrupters that were undercutting the cultural and economic power of the big industries that many people despised entertainment giants cable and phone companies and the news media among others during the periods where incumbents are battling disrupters in general the u s has done a good job of encouraging disrupters said julius genachowski the former chairman of the federal communications commission who is now a partner at the carlyle group a private equity firm that describes the general direction of policy during the obama administration the tech giants were less giant for much of the obama years and various parts of the united states regulatory and legal infrastructure sought to protect and nurture them during mr genachowski s term at the f c c and then again during the term of his successor tom wheeler the commission passed rules favoring network neutrality which declared that telecommunications companies could not favor some kinds of content online over others it was a policy broadly favored by tech companies but as mr genachowski noted as the disrupters grow the dynamic often shifts the next part of the arc is that disrupters become very successful and in some ways turn into incumbents and then you see two things battles between incumbents and other incumbents and a next generation of disrupters tackling incumbents he said that s where we are now the five have become incumbents themselves and they are more likely to be treated as such by governments who will look to both sides of the ledger their benefits to society as well as their potential costs when deciding how to police them but there s a twist with the five unlike in previous eras of tech it is not clear that there are many potential disrupters among today s the battles for dominance in cloud services artificial intelligence and data mining assistants cars virtual reality and most every other next big thing are being waged among the five that could likely raise the hackles of regulators and lawmakers even more and depending on your position on corporate power versus governmental power things could be fabulous or frightful ',\n",

among those who in sarah palin s notable 2008 formulation think that they re i guess better than anyone else as an adjective the word elite still conveys something positive even aspirational elite

and pushed the downside to the and americans complains trump s adviser steve bannon of harvard goldman sachs and hollywood in this formulation elites are a destructive condescending collective plotting against the beleaguered masses outside their ranks and in these attacks the and his team are deploying one of the most effective partisan political stereotypes of the modern age for most of american history sentiment was a matter of up versus down not left versus right but about half a century ago the conservative movement set out to claim politics as its own that meant redefining the term away from class and toward culture where the elite could be identified by its liberal ideas coastal real estate and highbrow consumer preferences the club for growth captured this type in a famous 2004 attack ad instructing the democrat howard dean to take his new york freak show back to vermont where it belongs trump adjusted the formula for the hot topics of the 2016 campaign i was on the right side of that issue as you know with the people he boasted after brexit adding that hillary as always stood with the elites his complaints against political correctness conjure a world of absurdist campus politics where overprivileged students squabble over gender pronouns and the fine points of racial victimization media elites come in for special attack cordoned off in pens to be mocked and jeered at during rallies labeled both liars and incompetents but trump has also ventured beyond mere turning the 2016 election into a competition between knowledge systems the people versus the elites his campaign insisted for months that pollsters and technocrats and media would be proven wrong by his electoral success the fact that he did win dealt a blow to an entire worldview one in which empirical inquiry and were supposed to triumph in the end the question now is whether it s possible to run an executive branch based on hostility toward experts and professionals of all political stripes and how many billionaires and ivy leaguers trump can appoint before this rhetorical pose begins to break down altogether the notion that distant elites might be conspiring against the people comes straight from the founding fathers whose declaration of independence lamented the long train of abuses and usurpations inflicted upon ordinary americans by an arrogant british king from there on united states history might be seen as a repeating cycle of revolt the jacksonians rebelled against the founders aristocratic pretensions northern free labor went to war against the oligarchical slavocracy and the populist revolts of the late 19th century adapted this story to modern capitalism with farmers and laborers rebelling against robber barons bankers experts and professionals the first historians to study those populists described them as heroic crusaders champions of the people against the powers but by the middle of the 20th century alarmed by the rise of fascism and homegrown demagogues like senator joseph mccarthy a new generation of scholars took a more anxious view of the spirit in his 1955 book the age of reform richard hofstadter dismissed the populists as provincial the latent fascists of their day eight years later his in american life documented a dangerous suspicion of the critical mind that seemed to course through the national culture from his perspective the 1952 election captured everything wrong with american political life with dwight eisenhower s philistinism winning over adlai stevenson s intellect hofstadter did not usually describe his ideal intellectually minded citizens as members of an elite that word conveyed something different a ruling class that held direct political and economic power the most famous articulation of this view came from the sociologist c wright mills in his 1956 assessment of america s power elite they rule the big corporations mills wrote they run the machinery of the state and claim its prerogatives they direct the military establishment in mills s view these people were tied together not by culture or ideology but by their positions at the helms of large institutions as individuals they might be republicans or democrats and might live in ohio or california the point was that they were in charge of things but that vision never gained much traction in mainstream politics where a more partisan targeted definition was starting to emerge william f buckley jr carved out some essentials in his first book god and man at yale drawing a neat distinction between respectable men like himself and the socialistic eggheads of the professoriate ronald reagan chose the term elite to bring it all together in his famed 1964 speech a time for choosing delivered on behalf of the republican presidential candidate barry goldwater this is the issue of this election he said whether we believe in our capacity for or whether we abandon the american revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves lyndon johnson won that election in a blowout but reagan s vision of a smug and detached liberal elite helped spark the oncoming culture wars pitting a supposedly indignant middle america against the liberal snobs of the coasts by the 1990s with the rise of media stars like rush limbaugh and bill o reilly bashing the liberal elite had become a favorite blood sport of the american right despite all the abuse hurled their way some liberal elites have accepted at least part of their detractors critique particularly on the progressive left it was during bill clinton s presidency that the social critic christopher lasch published the revolt of the elites and the betrayal of democracy which mourned that liberals had turned into petulant intolerant scolds thoroughly out of touch with the concerns of middle america since then the torch has passed to a younger generation of writers including msnbc s chris hayes whose 2012 twilight of the elites called for rethinking the entire ethos of liberal meritocracy a system he argued that tends to fuel and incompetence at the top while offering little but contempt and dim prospects for those at the bottom so as 2017 begins we find ourselves in a strange and uncertain political moment antipathy toward a wealthy preening managerial class seems to be gaining popularity across the political spectrum and oddly to have helped elect a wealthy preening incoming president meanwhile both liberal and conservative elites are scrambling to figure out what happens if the continues to reject basic political norms and even routine intelligence briefings under a trump presidency such elites may have no choice but to attempt a radical redefinition of their role in american life otherwise the man in the white house will do it for them ',\n",

proposed in february chose to give his future bride a full day of bliss rather than a single moment of happiness an hour after he sneaked out of their apartment at 6 a m he called her with instructions to go into their kitchen where she found a huge bouquet of white lilies with several notes that he had left for her including one that read today is the day that we get engaged and another that read enjoy the moments ahead of you have fun and say yes what ensued was a dizzying series of events that first took ms helmling to the nomad hotel in manhattan where she found her three best friends waiting at a breakfast table a waiter then gave them a note with instructions to walk across the street to a spa where they each enjoyed champagne and a massage before being whisked away for manicures and pedicures later in the day ms helmling was chauffeured over the george washington bridge to a small park in new jersey overlooking the hudson river the spot where mr turke had first asked her out in september 2013 when she arrived we hugged and cried and she told me all about her day said mr turke who also presented a slide show that included every photo that had both of them in

taking into account all the things in life that mattered most to him and quickly realized that ms mathiowetz was at the top of that list those shared experiences brought them back together and in

       " 'washington congress opened for battle over the affordable care act on wednesday as republicans pushed immediately forward to repeal the health care law and president obama made a rare trip to capitol hill to defend it the bitterness that has long marked the fight intensified as republicans seized the opportunity to make good on a central campaign promise to get rid of the law a pledge reinforced on wednesday by vice mike pence who met with house republicans not far from where the president gathered with democrats the affordable care act mr obama s signature health care law has created online insurance marketplaces offered new protections to people seeking health insurance and provided coverage to millions of people near the poverty line through expanded medicaid health policy experts say that system could collapse if republicans cut off funds for the expanded coverage and end penalties for people who go without health insurance the american people voted decisively for a better future for health care in this country mr pence said and we are determined to give them that he said that donald j trump would use his executive authority to help make the transition away from the health care law but did not offer specifics democrats vowed aggressive resistance however and said they would not participate in drawing up a replacement for the law after the swift efforts to unravel it senator chuck schumer of new york the new democratic leader playing off mr trump s campaign slogan said repealing the law would make america sick again republicans are using a procedural approach that will allow them to repeal substantial parts of the health care law without democrats being able to mount a filibuster in the senate by a vote of 51 to 48 on wednesday the senate took the first step agreeing to take up a budget resolution or blueprint that would clear the way for legislation repealing major provisions of the law but even as republicans spoke of moving quickly to repeal the law it remained far less clear how and when they would go about replacing it senate debate on the budget resolution is expected to continue for several days and the house plans to take up the measure once the senate has approved it as republicans charged ahead both sides seemed cognizant of the possible fallout from unwinding the law which has become deeply enmeshed with america s health care system and has provided insurance for about 20 million people mr trump weighed in with several twitter posts he advised that republicans needed to be careful in that the dems own the failed obamacare disaster and added don t let the schumer clowns out of this web mr trump predicted that the health care law would fall of its own weight representative chris collins of new york a republican who is one of mr trump s top supporters in congress and is part of his transition team said it was important to be sure that democrats bear responsibility for the failings of the health care law republicans point out that premiums have risen and that consumers in many places have fewer choices of insurers we have to make sure we keep reminding america we are repealing it because it failed we are repealing it because they all but demanded that we repeal it mr collins said and that was a key piece of donald trump s campaign but as republicans expressed eagerness to repeal the law they acknowledged that replacing it would take more time it is also unclear how insurance companies will react during this period and whether they will continue to offer the marketplace plans that millions of people have come to rely on there will naturally be a reasonable transition period said senator ted cruz republican of texas you can t adopt new reforms all at once senator john cornyn of texas the no 2 senate republican noted that it had taken six years to get into the ditch we find ourselves in now when your truck or car is in a ditch the first thing you need to do is get out of the ditch mr cornyn said and sometimes that takes a lot of hard work to that senator debbie stabenow democrat of michigan parried that when a car goes into a ditch the first thing i don t do is dismantle the car that doesn t help me get anywhere in terms of transportation she said democrats signaled little interest in helping republicans determine what to do after repealing major parts of the health care law mr schumer predicted that in a year republicans would regret that they came out so fast out of the box he said democrats would consider working on a replacement only after republicans presented their own plan if you are repealing show us what you ll replace it with first mr schumer said then we ll look at what you have and see what we can do later mr schumer said of mr trump it s his and their responsibility plain and simple name calling isn t going to get anything done he added they really need to calm things down a little speaker paul d ryan tried to offer assurance that no change in coverage would be abrupt the point is in 2017 we don t want people to be caught with nothing he said we want to make sure that there s an orderly transition so that the rug is not pulled out from under the families who are currently struggling under obamacare while we bring relief mr obama huddled with congressional democrats for about 90 minutes in what was billed by the white house as a strategy session to forge a unified democratic response to the republicans rollback effort in reality the session was essentially a party for a man who passed his signature legislative accomplishment under majorities in congress and a pep rally for affordable care act defenders in the words of an attendee representative hank johnson democrat of georgia the gathering which could be mr obama s last trip to the halls of congress that have been the site of alternating triumph and defeat had a air with numerous democratic lawmakers including mr johnson sneaking out to attend to business more pressing than hearing the president s words mr obama for his part did not ask his allies to block all efforts to alter the law but warned democrats against rescuing republicans by defecting on votes that would dismantle it the president provided an array of arguments for keeping the affordable care act and offered a mild mea culpa for his shortcomings as a salesman over the years senator jeff merkley democrat of oregon said he acknowledged the failures in selling the law in its entirety to the american people ',\n",
       " 'washington republicans hope to repeal major parts of the affordable care act using an expedited procedure known as budget reconciliation the process is sometimes called arcane but it has been used often in the past 35 years to write some of the nation s most important laws reconciliation is probably the most potent budget enforcement tool available to congress for a large portion of the budget the congressional research service a nonpartisan arm of congress has said here is a primer q what is the budget reconciliation process a it is a way for congress to speed action on legislation that changes taxes or spending especially spending for entitlement programs like medicare and medicaid although conceived primarily as a way to reduce federal budget deficits it has also been used to cut taxes and to create programs that increase spending changes that can raise deficits in the senate a reconciliation bill can ordinarily be passed with a simple majority for other bills a majority is often needed to limit debate and move to a final vote q why is it called reconciliation a the term originated in the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 which was intended to give congress more control over the budget process by allowing lawmakers to set overall levels of spending and revenue the process begins with a budget blueprint a resolution that guides congress but is not presented to the president for a signature or veto it recommends federal revenue deficit debt and spending levels in areas like defense energy education and health care the resolution may direct one or more committees to develop legislation to achieve specified budgetary results by adopting these proposals congress can change existing laws so that actual revenue and spending are brought into line with reconciled with policies in the budget resolution q how has reconciliation been used a since 1980 congress has completed action on 24 budget reconciliation bills twenty became law four were vetoed the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1981 was a vehicle for much of the reagan revolution it squeezed savings out of social security medicare medicaid food stamps the school lunch program farm subsidies student loans welfare and jobless benefits among many other programs in 1996 congress reversed six decades of social welfare policy eliminating the individual entitlement to cash assistance for the nation s poorest children and giving each state a lump sum of federal money with vast discretion over its use those changes were made in a reconciliation bill pushed by republicans but signed by president bill clinton congress reduced deficits with another reconciliation bill the balanced budget act of 1997 that law also created the children s health insurance program primarily for uninsured children in families on the same day in 1997 mr clinton signed a separate reconciliation bill that cut taxes the bush tax cuts were adopted in reconciliation bills signed by president george w bush in 2001 and 2003 on several occasions congress has increased assistance to working families by increasing the tax credit in reconciliation bills congress also made changes to the affordable care act in a reconciliation bill passed immediately after president obama signed the health care overhaul in 2010 later when republicans controlled both houses of congress they passed a reconciliation bill to eviscerate the affordable care act but mr obama vetoed the bill in january 2016 republicans say that measure will provide a template or starting point for their efforts to undo the health care law this year with support from donald j trump who calls the law an absolute disaster q how does the reconciliation process work in the senate a in the house leaders of the majority party can usually control what happens if their members stick together in the senate by contrast one member or a handful of senators can often derail the leaders plans the reconciliation process enhances the power of the majority party and its leaders senate debate on a reconciliation bill is normally limited to 20 hours so it cannot be filibustered on the senate floor the senate has a special rule to prevent abuse of the budget reconciliation process the rule named for former senator robert c byrd democrat of west virginia generally bars use of the procedure to consider legislation that has no effect on spending taxes and deficits the senate parliamentarian normally decides whether particular provisions violate the byrd rule but the senate can waive the rule with a majority q what does this mean for the affordable care act a republicans hope to use the procedure of budget reconciliation to repeal or nullify provisions of the law that affect spending and taxes they could for example eliminate penalties imposed on people who go without insurance and on larger employers who do not offer coverage to employees they could use a reconciliation bill to eliminate tens of billions of dollars provided each year to states that have expanded eligibility for medicaid and they could use it to repeal subsidies for private health insurance coverage obtained through the public marketplaces known as exchanges republicans could also repeal a number of taxes and fees imposed on certain people and on health insurers and manufacturers of prescription drugs and medical devices tax increases that help offset the cost of the insurance coverage expansions those provisions were all rolled back in the reconciliation bill mr obama vetoed last january that bill did not touch insurance market standards established in the affordable care act which do not directly cost the government money or raise taxes the standards stipulate for example that insurers cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because of a person s conditions insurers must allow parents to keep children on their policies until the age of 26 and they cannot charge women higher rates than men as they often did in the past such provisions are politically popular but it is not clear how they could remain in force without the coverage expansions that help insurers afford such regulations without an effective requirement for people to carry insurance and without subsidies supporters of the health law say many healthy people would go without coverage knowing they could obtain it if they became ill and needed it democrats say they will fight to preserve the law after mr obama leaves office recent history shows that lobbying and public pressure can sometimes make a difference altering the votes of individual lawmakers and changing the contents of a reconciliation bill ',\n",
       " 'washington majorities in congress often overreach but usually not on the very first day house republicans on the verge of a washington takeover as the new congress convened tuesday couldn t stop themselves from trying to dilute the power of a despised ethics watchdog as their first order of business in the process they created an unsightly spectacle that pretty much ruined an celebration of unified republican government undermined their own leadership and perhaps foretold the shape of things to come house republicans take a stand on a contentious issue donald j trump turns to twitter to break with house republicans then republicans frantically reverse course mr trump campaigned that he was going to drain the swamp and here we are on day 1 trying to fill the swamp representative walter b jones republican of north carolina said after he and his colleagues hurriedly jettisoned a plan seen as a brazen attempt to weaken an independent ethics office that some felt had been unfair to lawmakers that is not a good way to start deluged by angry phone calls and bad headlines chagrined republican officials say they were well on their way to abandoning the ethics revisions adopted monday night in a party meeting before mr trump weighed in via twitter and suggested that the overhaul shouldn t be a top priority urging republicans to focus instead on taxes and health care but the final decision did come after the s twitter posts underscoring his sway over house republicans who had moved ahead despite objections and warnings about the optics of the change from speaker paul d ryan and representative kevin mccarthy of california the majority leader house republicans might have amusedly applauded mr trump s cutting tweets when they were aimed at the news media and other common foes but they found them measurably less funny when the criticisms were directed their way raising alarms among republicans about his power to corral them via social media following the decision to reverse course several lawmakers were quietly fretting that mr trump s megaphone was much more powerful than they had realized other republicans both on and off capitol hill were wondering how the proposal got as far as it did given the stated reservations of mr ryan and mr mccarthy among others they said it did not bode well that the rank and file was so willing to ignore leadership on such a potentially critical matter demonstrating once again how hard it can be to manage the house republicans even when the party is set to control both capitol hill and the white house mr ryan had already headed off an earlier rules change that was deemed potentially embarrassing a proposal to let lawmakers resume funding of pet projects through designated earmarks as long as the money went to public entities abuse of earmarks was one of the main sources of congressional corruption that led to tighter ethics rules and a ban on such spending and mr ryan and his allies believed that a quick move to restore them so soon after mr trump s election would not send the proper signal but mr ryan has promised to revisit both the earmark issue and the revisions to the office of congressional ethics later this year the ethics office was created in 2008 at the urging of representative nancy pelosi the california democrat who was then the house speaker this was in response to criticism that the select committee on ethics comprising lawmakers from both parties was ineffective given a string of corruption cases and other breakdowns such as a scandal involving teenage house pages lawmakers from both parties were against the office then as well as now and would much prefer to be judged by their peers politicians currently serving in the house who might be more sympathetic as opposed to a more discrete board and staff but in moving ahead with the rules change on a strictly partisan basis republicans opened the door to democrats berating them for the proposal even though a significant number of democrats are just as unhappy with the ethics office it was similar to a move house republicans made in 2005 when they used the rules package to weaken the ethics committee itself after a series of rebukes against tom delay the majority leader that decision sparked an outcry from democrats and watchdog groups that helped democrats regain the majority the next year with a message that republicans were fostering a culture of corruption i think it is always better to do changes to the ethics process in a bipartisan manner said john feehery a former top republican aide in the house it protects you from political attacks the tussle over the ethics office is just one illustration of how mr trump and his outsider ideas could clash with his own party in congress mr trump has vowed to move forward with a proposal to impose term limits on congress and many in the party are not happy with that idea other sources of friction are bound to emerge given his campaign message about shaking up washington i just could not believe that the congress does not understand that if anything we need to bring sunshine in mr jones said house republicans may understand that idea a little bit better now ',\n",

the securities and exchange commission is a strong signal that financial regulation in the trump administration will emphasize helping companies raise capital in the public markets over tightening regulation in contrast the agency s two chairwomen under president obama had regulatory or enforcement backgrounds mr clayton known as jay has spent nearly his entire career in corporate boardrooms his regulatory experience stems from advising banks on dealings with the government and helping several financial institutions with their settlements related to mortgage securities he had a seat to the financial crisis advising barclays capital in buying the assets of the bankrupt lehman brothers in 2008 and bear stearns in its fire sale to jpmorgan chase in 2007 he has advised on mergers and initial public offerings including the biggest ever the 25 billion offering by alibaba group of china in 2013 if mr clayton is confirmed he may have to recuse himself from some matters a similar scrutiny was applied to mary jo white the agency s current chairwoman she had been a litigator at debevoise plimpton where her clients included jpmorgan chase rupert murdoch s news corporation and kenneth d lewis a former bank of america chief executive still such recusals are not unusual laura s unger a former commissioner and acting chairwoman said that during her tenure she had to recuse herself from a number of matters before the commission she said the process of deciding when to recuse oneself often took place in consultation with the commission s ethics officer an ethics officer at the s e c knows all of your intimate details and the ethics officer flags for you what may be potential conflicts she noted yet mr clayton s nomination will be sure to fuel criticism that goldman

perhaps its most important deal the 5 billion investment by warren e buffett s berkshire hathaway amid the financial crisis mr clayton s wife works as a adviser at goldman the s e c nomination follows the appointment of goldman s no 2 executive gary d cohn to be the top economic policy adviser to donald j trump and the selection of a hedge fund manager who was a former goldman trader steven t mnuchin to be treasury secretary mr trump s chief strategist stephen k bannon is a former goldman banker during the presidential campaign mr trump had repeatedly criticized goldman sachs as an emblem of a financial elite mr trump who met with mr clayton on dec 22 said in a statement that the lawyer will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time mr clayton is expected to face scrutiny on his confirmation as a sullivan cromwell colleague h rodgin cohen did in 2009 mr cohen the dean of wall street lawyers withdrew his name from consideration for a senior treasury role amid an outcry over his deep involvement in nearly all the bank deals struck during the financial crisis it s hard to see how an attorney who spent his career

country and i do feel sorry for the innocent white people that are killed daily at the hands of the lower race i have shed a tear of for myself i feel pity that i had to do what i did in the first place i feel pity that i had to give up my life because of a situation that should never have existed as the government laid out its case for a death sentence the prosecutor who read from the journal nathan s williams an assistant united states attorney told the jury of 10 women and two men that mr roof s deadly rampage was a premeditated act that had devastated the families of his victims the defendant didn t stop after shooting one person or two or four or five he killed nine people mr williams said a few moments before he declared the death penalty is justified later aided by a slide show he described each of the victims and their lives setting the stage for several days of testimony by family members and friends of the victims mr williams emphasized that mr roof was capable of remorse and regret reminding jurors that he had left his mother a note of apology but only for the pain he knew his actions would cause his own family the presentations were a startling beginning to the trial s sentencing phase which is expected to run into next week in federal district court on dec 15 after six days of testimony in which defense lawyers did not contest his guilt the jury found mr roof guilty of 33 counts including hate crimes obstruction of religion resulting in death and firearms charges eighteen of those counts require the jury to decide whether to sentence mr roof now 22 to death or life in prison without the possibility of parole to impose a death sentence jurors must unanimously find that aggravating factors like premeditation and the number and vulnerability of the victims outweigh any mitigating factors like the absence of prior violent behavior and demonstrations of redemption and remorse mr roof is also facing a death penalty trial in state court although many people in the courtroom had already heard mr roof s flat monotone during the guilt phase when prosecutors played a video recording of his confession to f b i agents his statement on wednesday was his first to the jury mr roof chose to allow his legal team to represent him during the guilt phase but sidelined them during the penalty proceedings to prevent them from introducing any evidence regarding his family background or mental capacity the point is that i m not going to lie to you not by myself or through somebody else mr roof told the jury as his paternal grandparents watched from the second row on the left side of the courtroom several women on the right side which is reserved for victims family members left their seats one of them muttering curses mr roof has said he does not plan to call witnesses or present evidence on his behalf and he did not any of the prosecution s witnesses on wednesday his approach stands in sharp contrast to the strategy of justice department lawyers who have said they may call more than 30 witnesses including at least one survivor of the attack family members of the victims and federal law enforcement officials prosecutors began wednesday with the widow of the rev clementa c pinckney the church s slain pastor and his two best friends jennifer benjamin pinckney who was married to mr pinckney for 15 years narrated an affectionate and often lighthearted telling of their life together illustrated by dozens of photographs of her husband as a young saxophone player in a school band attending the births of their two daughters vacationing on caribbean cruises and on a trip to seattle she described him as a preacher who extended his ministry as a voice for the voiceless to his work in the south carolina legislature where he served first in the house and then the senate often exhausted by his dual roles he was depicted in several pictures as having fallen asleep in the back seat of the family car and on a couch while reading to his daughters he was the person that i think every mom would be happy that her daughter would marry ms pinckney a school librarian said he was that great catch ms pinckney also described her terror on the night of june 17 2015 as she and the couple s younger daughter malana then 6 listened to the gunfire from their hiding place beneath a desk in her husband s study as her husband and the others were gunned down in the adjacent church fellowship hall ms pinckney struggled to keep her daughter quiet and still i was just like shh shh shh ms pinckney said and i put my hand over her mouth and she was holding on to me and she put her hand on my mouth mama is daddy going to die her daughter asked ms pinckney said she said the hardest thing she had ever done was telling her two daughters early the next morning that their father had been killed ms pinckney said she had heard mr roof try to open the door to the study which she had locked when the shooting began another assistant united states attorney julius n richardson asked why she thought she had been spared it wasn t my time ms pinckney answered i couldn t see god taking both parents away from two small kids the rev kylon middleton an a m e minister who had known mr pinckney from childhood described his lifelong friend as immensely precocious he began preaching at 13 and strategically ambitious he aspired to be both a bishop and perhaps the state s first governor in addition to mr pinckney the victims were the rev depayne middleton doctor 49 cynthia hurd 54 susie jackson 87 ethel lee lance 70 tywanza sanders 26 the rev daniel lee simmons sr 74 the rev sharonda 45 and myra thompson 59 near the end of the day ms thompson s widower the rev anthony b thompson the vicar of a reformed episcopal church here told jurors about their marriage their anniversary date to a beach his wife s determined demeanor and her commitment to the historic congregation in testimony that was mixed with laughter and tears mr thompson recounted their final day together as she prepared for the evening study of the gospel of mark she had her glow he said i mean this smile on her face she was radiant i just kept looking at her word of a shooting came hours later and mr thompson rushed to the church he demanded to know whether she had been injured or killed he eventually found out my whole world was gone he said i literally did not know what to do everything i did was for her and she was gone what am i here for if she s gone what am i here for ',\n",
       " 'istanbul turkish officials accused the united states of abetting a failed coup last summer when the russian ambassador to turkey was assassinated last month the turkish press said the united states was behind the attack and once again after a gunman walked into an istanbul nightclub early on new year s day and killed dozens the news media pointed a finger at the united states america chief suspect one headline blared after the attack on twitter a turkish lawmaker referring to the name of the nightclub wrote whoever the triggerman is reina attack is an act of cia period turkey has been confronted with a cascade of crises that seem to have only accelerated as the syrian civil war has spilled across the border but the events have not pushed turkey closer to its nato allies conversely they have drifted further apart as the nation lashes out at washington and moves closer to moscow working with the russian president vladimir v putin to secure a in syria one story in the turkish press based on a routine travel warning issued by the american embassy in turkey was that the united states had advance knowledge of the nightclub attack which the islamic state later claimed responsibility for another suggested that stun grenades used by the gunman had come from stocks held by the american military still another claimed the assault was a plot by the united states to sow divisions in turkey between the secular and the religious rather than bringing the united states and turkey together in the common fight against terrorism the nightclub attack even with the gunman still on the run appears to have only accelerated turkey s shift away from the west at a time when its democracy is eroding amid a growing crackdown on civil society all of this is a reflection many critics say of what they call the paranoia and authoritarianism of turkey s president recep tayyip erdogan whose leadership has so deeply divided the country that instead of unifying to confront terrorism turkish society is fracturing further with each attack the west symbolized by the united states is the perennial bogeyman while seeming to pile on the obama administration in its waning days by accusing it of supporting turkey s enemies including the islamic state kurdish militants and supporters of an exiled muslim cleric fethullah gulen whom mr erdogan blamed for directing the coup turkish officials are also telegraphing something else that they are willing to open the door and improve relations with the united states once donald j trump takes office our expectation from the new administration is to end this shame turkey s prime minister binali yildirim said this week while accusing the united states of providing weapons to kurdish militants in syria who are fighting the islamic state but are also an enemy of turkey we are not holding the new administration responsible for this mr yildirim said because this is the work of the obama administration meanwhile the nightclub assailant is on the loose the turkish authorities said on wednesday that they had identified the killer but refused to release any other details although photographs of the man from surveillance cameras have been released also a video surfaced that appeared to show the assailant recording himself in istanbul s taksim square a senior united states official who has been briefed on the investigation and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential details said the turks had recovered the video from a raid on a house in istanbul the official said the turks now believed the killer was from uzbekistan not kyrgyzstan as many reports this week had first suggested the official expressed alarm at the growing in turkey which seems to accumulate after each crisis here and said it put the lives of americans in the country in jeopardy the chaotic investigation has added to the anxiety on istanbul s streets with vehicle checkpoints night raids on houses and helicopters there is significant fear in ordinary people said aydin engin a columnist at the daily newspaper cumhuriyet who was detained last year as part of the government s crackdown on the news media fear prevails when it comes to going to an entertainment place being in a crowd going to a shopping mall getting on the metro with each passing day public life descends deeper into what many turks concede is a mix of darkness and seeming absurdity with growing fears of violence and expressions of xenophobia set next to repressions on civic life in the days before and after the nightclub massacre on the shores of the bosporus nationalists staged a mock execution of santa claus in the name of defending islam a reporter for the wall street journal was detained and placed in solitary confinement for according to the newspaper s account violating a government ban on publication of images from an islamic state video and a fashion designer was beaten up at the istanbul airport and arrested for his social media posts in a way it s basically a breakdown of order said soli ozel a turkish columnist and academic seeking to explain the tumult in society everyone feels entitled to do whatever they want to do and how they want to do it tugrul eryilmaz another longtime turkish journalist recalled the country s military coup in 1980 and the crackdown on civil society that followed and said i have never been in such a situation like today he brought up the spanish filmmaker luis buñuel who was known for surreal and absurd themes i feel like i am in his movies he said while turkey faces a growing terrorism threat the country is also largely at war with itself with deep divisions along many lines religion class ethnicity that make unity difficult even in a time of crisis perhaps the greatest source of division is between supporters of mr erdogan about half the country and opponents who assert that he has become too powerful turkey is so deeply polarized around the powerful persona of erdogan that instead of asking why terror attacks are happening and how they can be stopped the and blocks in the country are blaming each other said soner cagaptay a specialist on turkey at the washington institute for near east policy this is why i am deeply worried about turkey and the country s ability to stymie further terror attacks parliament voted overnight to extend by three months the state of emergency that went into effect last summer after the failed coup the emergency grants mr erdogan s government extraordinary powers to detain perceived opponents and hold them in pretrial detention tens of thousands of people have either been arrested or been purged from their jobs on suspicion of having links to mr gulen who now lives in pennsylvania mr erdogan on wednesday made his first public remarks since the attack on sunday morning a striking period of silence for a man who is normally ubiquitous in the public sphere often giving speeches daily mr erdogan an islamist rejected criticism that his government in pushing an islamist agenda had deepened divisions between the secular and the pious many on social media in the aftermath of the nightclub attack noted that the turkish government s religious authorities had denounced new year s celebrations as as the president of all 79 million citizens mr erdogan said it is my duty to protect everyone s rights law and spaces of freedom mr erdogan who spoke this week with president obama in a condolence call also told his audience what he believed turkey in facing so many terrorist attacks was really up against a plot by the west invoking the collapse of the ottoman empire after world war i and the subsequent turkish war against western armies and their proxies he said today turkey is in a new struggle for independence ',\n",
       " 'beirut lebanon for millions of damascus residents concerns about the direction of the war in syria have been replaced by worries about where to get enough water to do the dishes wash clothes or take a shower for nearly two weeks the syrian capital and its vicinity have been afflicted by a water crisis that has left taps dry caused long lines at wells and forced people to stretch whatever thin resources they can find when the world gets hard for us we work something out said a woman in a video posted on facebook showing how she used a cola bottle to wash teacups when you cut off the water we dig for water when you cut off the tap we make a tap like most of syria s problems the damascus water crisis is a symptom of the war which has killed hundreds of thousands of people displaced about half the country s prewar population of 22 million and left its territory divided into zones controlled by the government armed rebels and jihadist groups while a brokered by russia and turkey and announced last week has reduced overall violence across the country it has not stopped the fighting everywhere nor has it resolved what happens when resources needed by one side are controlled by its enemies as appears to be the case with damascus s water historically most of the water for the capital which is controlled by the government of president bashar has come from the barada valley north of the city which is controlled by rebels who want to oust mr assad the crisis began on dec 22 when the water stopped flowing each side has accused the other of damaging infrastructure near the spring halting the flow antigovernment activists have posted photos online purporting to show structures around the spring that they say were damaged by exploding barrels dropped from government helicopters the government first accused the rebels of polluting the water then of damaging the infrastructure jens laerke a spokesman for the united nations humanitarian office in geneva said by email tuesday that the deliberate targeting of the water infrastructure had caused the but we are not in a position to say by whom he said the area has been the scene of much fighting so we have not been able to access it now 5 5 million people in damascus and the vicinity lack water which has raised the risk of waterborne disease especially among children he said fighting near the barada valley has continued despite the antigovernment activists say that government forces and fighters from lebanon s hezbollah organization have continued to attack the area in an apparent attempt to take it over the syrian observatory for human rights which tracks the conflict from britain through a network of contacts in syria said the government launched 15 airstrikes on the area monday amid clashes between rebels and forces turkey s foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu accused the syrian government and its allies on wednesday of violating the saying that the new violence could derail peace talks meant to be held in astana the capital of kazakhstan on jan 23 rebel groups have threatened to boycott the talks if government attacks do not stop few damascus residents expect much from the talks or have time to think about them while generally safe from the violence that had reduced other parts of the country to rubble they were struggling through a cold winter of high prices and scarce commodities before the water crisis making things worse the syrian government has sought to ease the crisis by trucking water from wells around the city and the united nations has rehabilitated 120 wells to cover about of the city s daily needs mr laerke the spokesman said but many residents said they had received nothing some were buying water from men with private tankers while others took advantage of whatever they could get a shopkeeper said he had not had a shower in 10 days but that he and his sons went to the mosque every day to wash their hands feet and faces an option not available to the women of the house at home he said they used plastic utensils because they could not wash dishes one woman said she had not had running water in her home for 10 days her two sons have spent hours each day lining up to fill jugs from the well at their mosque they use that to drink and to wash dishes collecting the runoff to flush the toilet my family s dream is to get a warm shower she said speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions for communicating with a foreign news outlet without government permission it has become our ultimate hope in damascus to have enough water to take showers and wash clothes in the automatic washing machine she expressed anger that syria s news media had said little about the water crisis instead focusing on the military s battles with rebels we are fed up with the news of military operations she said we want news about water and water supply schedules despite the water crisis conditions in damascus are far better than those in aleppo the northern city and former commercial epicenter of the country where syrian and russian forces prevailed last month after prolonged bombardments of its eastern side while the appears to be holding there the formerly eastern quarters are abandoned wastelands united nations relief officials said nothing prepared us for what we saw sajjad malik the united nations acting humanitarian coordinator for syria told reporters wednesday in a telephone briefing from aleppo the infrastructure was destroyed in almost every neighborhood mr malik said more than 100 united nations relief workers from several agencies were helping civil defense teams remove debris and provide emergency food water shelter and medical care in the city where four million people once lived he estimated that 1 5 million people remain in aleppo mostly on the western side including roughly 400 000 syrians displaced from other areas he also said thousands of displaced residents from the eastern side were starting to return even if their homes and businesses were badly damaged or destroyed they re beginning to talk about rebuilding their lives and livelihoods mr malik said but he cautioned that aleppo s reconstruction is going to take a much longer time and way more resources than we have right now ',\n",

up with my moods i was going through a breakup and had decided that in order to strengthen my moral fiber i should camp alone for three days in the woods i instructed my mother to drop me off at my

oldest known human habitation circa 5850 b c the area is the place of origin for the kwakiutl peoples the land of the kwakiutl whose name translates to smoke of the world was taken into ownership both private and national by gunpoint dishonored treaties and restrictive and discriminatory laws the scramble for artifacts and the theft of kwakiutl art work that was celebrated by claude as among the most sophisticated in the world has meant that much of the community s historical work is housed in museums elsewhere after 1849 the kwakiutl population was decimated but it survives in 2013 british

grindstone and turned it into a nonviolent resistance education center staging legendary games that recreated the infamous stanford prison experiment as a way to train the prisoners to fight oppression with noncooperation a practice that ended after a disastrous fake invasion by a local biker gang retained for the purpose i came to grindstone as a young teenager in the attending the annual summer camps run by the nonprofit cooperative the quakers put together to manage the island the camps explicit mission was to train a new generation of activists another step on the ladder that they had climbed through trade unionism farmers unions suffragism and feminism to antiwar activism grindstone was full of kids like me babies who attended alternative public schools in toronto kingston and ottawa who could rhyme the classic protest chant with the facility of lifelong practice today it sounds hopelessly idealistic but in the 80s grindstone was a perfect incubator for young activists with its quiet paths crisp lake swimming and isolated spots with names like moonwatcher s point the grindstone experience was one part lazing around and chatting one part intense practical instruction the victorian cottages we slept in had once housed the political elites of ottawa society and their celebrity friends now they were ours i ve always been an early riser and it was on grindstone that i became addicted to sunrises swimming around the island to catch them on the still lake amid the loon calls then rushing in a shiver back to my cabin to change for breakfast and morning meeting on the broad shaded porch of the main lodge as i graduated out of the summer camps i became active in the maintenance and management of the island volunteering in the kitchens and

up residence there running small conferences for people interested in museums and the web five years ago my family and i were their guests the island felt haunted by the ghosts of the friends i d made there and the dreams we d shared it has been 25 years since i left grindstone on its final weekend as a social justice education center and not a week goes by without my yearning for it with a kind of joy and sorrow that is sunk very deep in my heart i visit it in my dreams and in the photo feeds from its current owners when i see them at museum conferences i demand to know all the minutiae of the

by the white lines of mining roads that seemed to loop and go nowhere before dawson city appeared through a hole in the cloud cover the subarctic town nicknamed paris of the north during the late gold rush looked like a strange solitary incursion on the land i was there to spend three months living in the childhood home of the canadian writer pierre berton who had donated the house for this purpose a volunteer picked me up at the airport on the drive through town we passed a truck with an animal carcass in the bed antlers poking out past a tarp black birds pecked at the exposed edges if you leave your moose out the ravens will get at it the volunteer said the yukon river divided the town into dawson proper and west dawson a scattered community of cabins whose inhabitants hauled their own wood water and propane i walked down to the river almost every day it was october and the black bottomless water flowed fast toward alaska over the next few weeks the river changed first the water took on the faint sheen of an oil slick then slivers of ice began to race along the current catching the light like the heads and bellies of surfacing seals then bigger chunks of ice formed audibly colliding and jostling for space until they clustered and at a bottleneck bend finally one morning in november i woke to an eerie noticeable silence i went down to the river s beach sheets of ice overlapped where they d heaved onto the shore their exposed resembling massive blocks of turquoise glass a government employee had drilled into the ice and laid out orange flags indicating where the ice was thick enough to walk safely i watched a dogsled cross because of the snow cover it wasn t immediately clear where the ground ended and the river began as i stepped out i could hear ice continuing to crack the sound of trickling water running in open rivulets under my feet i d been told ran water deep enough to swallow a truck this would be a stupid way to die i thought halfway

crossed and hiked triumphantly around west dawson which had been inaccessible except by helicopter during the the temperature dropped below degrees celsius when i returned to the house hours later i peeled off my jeans and saw that my thighs like my cheeks and nose were a raw violent red out on the river i had seen two other people crossing the first glided past on skis with a baby strapped to his chest the second was an acquaintance pulling a sled just picking up my mail he called kim fu is the author of the novel for today i am a boy and the poetry collection how festive the ambulance hans johann was a capitalist pig farmer a man who owned the pigs and the farm his wife was barbara they were both german mennonites after world war ii both had fled with their families from what was once prussia to niagara which is where on some acres between the lake and the waterfalls they stayed and became mama and papa then oma and opa my mother linda was the fourth of oma and opa s seven children born and christened at such a rate that the family could not afford middle names mama made up for this by calling me sarah nicole while my father one of four from the suburbs has never said anything but sarah at home in london ontario i sided with my dad thinking two names were less smart than one but when we went to the pig farm my name was turned by thick german tongues into this older extrinsic version of me was the one i liked best summers belonged to niagara driving to the farm in a station wagon with no empty seats we knew we were close when the asphalt turned to dirt and had arrived when the dirt turned to gravel a long lane in birches led to an ancient mercedes or two and a big john deere tractor a nameless cat curled under the exhaust pipe in the kitchen we ate oma s bread with havarti cheese and summer grapes on which a skim of dust belied a of gold what did we need money for nothing ice cream maybe if we wanted it in a cone from avondale dairy turtles swam with us in the pool the water cold and unchlorinated under scum colored the dim vegetative green of fairy tales before they re americanized oma said her ferns would grow better if we urinated in the soil and we rolled our eyes but did it one at a time i sneaked away to the gully read my aunt s ahistorical romance novels my brother shot a dove with a bb gun pigs screamed in the barn it seemed in those summers impossible that the sun could either burn me or fail to wake me up that i could ever be sick for more than three days or have an allergy i was no more friends with nature than i was friends

much or practices animal husbandry he lives in the bungalow on the farm and makes and sells peach and grape jam everyone thinks they know what peach and grape jam taste like but i maintain that opa s jam can make you forget what a fruit is sarah nicole prickett is a writer in new york and the founder of adult magazine a few years ago i got to pick a small village to stay in for a while and write poetry i chose the missisquoi valley in the eastern townships of quebec because i liked what the bay s first nations name meant many aquatic birds indeed i saw birds everywhere in my dreams above my head through the windows i saw the wind too moving across the cornfields the region also brought me back to my love of new england when choosing the town i was to stay in i d randomly pointed at a little village called mystic it was an enticing name i d also found a sister city in the united states with the same name which had a museum with a room dedicated to herman melville when i write i always let myself be led by coincidence i quickly started inventing connections between melville and the québécois mystic between me scribbling notes in a rented cavalier and the trailblazers of real and fictional territory that were the great american writers of the 19th century i also imagined stories of the devil whirling around in the town s barn and created my own private numerology i would look for covered bridges on the road round barns built by utopian quakers and victorian houses i thought about loyalists fleeing north after the revolutionary war about irish catholics fleeing famine about all the immigrants who left their mark along the path i knew that by venturing further to the shores of the great lake memphremagog i would also think about the vietnam war deserters who d found refuge there i thought about the first nation abenakis how they named the lakes and rivers and about our ignorance i began my stay at pike river but i understood that this road was one where each stop would lead to another i walked into the office of tourism in stanbridge station my next stop and asked a petite historian a thousand questions she showed me chemin st on the map which she called the second prettiest road in quebec i never learned where the first was i didn t stay in mystic as soon as i caught sight of the old cemetery in hunter mills i became fascinated by the border zone between quebec and the united states it represented the state i was in myself a wandering state of mind looking for ghosts mine and others looking for my words my promised land my house built stone by stone throughout my life and that is how having been asked to stay in a small village i found myself gathering the rosary beads of hamlets strung along the border area i m still enamored with the scenery i found there isolated villages in the shadow of the mountains whose grandeur lorded over long lakes and rivers farms and cornfields a mercedes up on four blocks amid the junk strewn in front of an abandoned house old cemeteries that pop up at every turn leafy trees of maple walnut beech oak birch a few wayside crosses old churches and train stations and checkpoints and in the morning at the inn by the river a little black cat sitting on a tree branch listening to the sound of the falls and the purring coffeepot élise turcotte a poet and novelist is the author of the sound of living things and guyana translated by allison m charette en français il y a quelques années on m a demandé de séjourner dans un petit village de mon choix afin d y écrire des poèmes j ai choisi la vallée de la

dans mes rêves autour de ma tête derrière les fenêtres je voyais aussi le vent bouger à travers les champs de maïs cette région me ramenait aussi à mon amour de la afin de choisir le village de mon séjour j avais pointé mon doigt sur un petit village appelé mystic ce nom m attirait j avais aussi découvert une ville homonyme aux où il y avait dans un musée une salle dédiée à melville je me laisse toujours guider par les coïncidences pour écrire j inventais d ores et déjà des liens entre melville et le mystic québécois entre moi prenant des notes dans une cavalier louée et ces défricheurs de territoires réels et fictifs que sont les grands écrivains américains du 19e siècle j imaginais aussi des histoires de diable tournant en rond dans la grange à douze côtés et créais une numérologie intime à moi je chercherais les ponts couverts sur la route les granges rondes construites par des quakers utopiques les maisons à façade victorienne je pensais à la fuite des loyalistes vers le nord aux irlandais catholiques fuyant la famine à tous ces immigrants ayant laissé leurs traces sur le chemin je savais qu en m aventurant plus loin aux abords du grand lac memphrémagog je penserais aussi aux déserteurs de la guerre du vietnam je pensais aux abénaquis des premières nations qui ont donné les noms aux lacs et aux rivières à notre ignorance à là où mon séjour commençait j ai compris cependant que j étais sur une route où chaque arrêt menait à un autre je suis entrée dans le bureau du tourisme j ai posé mille questions à une petite historienne de stanbridge station elle m a

       " 'on the morning of may 18 2014 violeta lagunes was perplexed by a series of strange messages that appeared in her gmail inbox it was election day to choose the leadership of mexico s partido acción nacional or pan and lagunes a former federal congresswoman was holding a strategy meeting in her office in puebla city the emails seemed harmless at least at first one appeared to come from the account of a trusted colleague it asked her to download and review a document lagunes clicked on the link but it seemed to be broken so she wrote back to her colleague and asked him to send it again elsewhere in her inbox was an email from google warning her that someone had tried to log in to her account meanwhile she began to receive phone calls from pan allies who claimed that they had received emails from lagunes s account that she did not remember sending now lagunes was worried around 1 o clock she called the colleague who appeared to have emailed her she reached him at a restaurant where he was finishing lunch with other campaign allies i did not send you an email he insisted a consultant with the campaign who asked to remain anonymous in order to preserve his relationships with other candidates overheard the conversation he knew of other campaign workers who had been receiving similar messages emails with vague subject lines asking the recipient to review a document or click a link the campaign he realized had been hacked in the vote for party leader lagunes and her allies in puebla a drive southeast from mexico city were supporting the challenger a senator who promised to return the party to its conservative roots but the incumbent was backed by puebla s powerful governor rafael moreno valle one of mexico s rising political stars moreno valle is close to mexico s president enrique peña nieto and has forged an alliance between pan and nieto s centrist partido revolucionario institucional or pri long the dominant force in mexican politics since winning the governorship in 2010 moreno valle s opponents say his ambitions have grown and he has resorted to increasingly harsh measures to keep puebla state including members of his own party under control in the beginning the governor was and respectful rafael micalco a former leader of pan in puebla state told me when he became governor he transformed now he controls the party through threats this race to retain control of the party leadership in 2014 was a crucial test for the governor who was rumored to be considering a run for mexico s presidency in 2018 this past september moreno valle publicly announced his intent to run clashes between the two camps were especially intense in puebla where backers of the challenger ernesto cordero claimed that the governor was using public money to support the incumbent gustavo madero though the governor s office has denied these charges shortly before the election madero s campaign manager said that cordero s side was trying to undermine the legitimacy of the process their strategy is clear from the outset he said in an interview with a mexican magazine u2009 if i win good if not i was cheated u2009 after lagunes s call on election day her colleagues rushed from the restaurant back to their local headquarters a hotel conference room that they had nicknamed the bunker all morning they had been trying to reach their field network a group of 40 cordero canvassers who were working to get out the vote in puebla state but the field network seemed to have gone dark few of the canvassers were even answering their phones hackers the team concluded must have found the list of the canvassers names and phone numbers widely circulated by email within the campaign and begun to intimidate them the day before the consultant told me the field network was motivated and eager to do this work after the hack it was very hard to reach them the few who did answer said that they had received phone calls saying that their lives were at stake they were worried that if they went out they or their families would get hurt according to another worker on cordero s campaign who also requested anonymity citing fear of reprisal the message to the canvassers was simple and direct we know who you are if you don t want any trouble shut down your cellphone and stop your activity the worker added it s an authoritarian regime madero won the election with 57 percent of the 162 792 votes cast over all in puebla his margin was substantially larger roughly 74 percent cordero s team decided not to contest the result they had suspicions about how they were hacked but it would be another year before any evidence emerged their political enemies leaked documents seemed to show had built a spying operation using software made by an italian firm called hacking team just one of many private companies that largely below public notice have sprung up to aid governments in surveilling the private lives of individual citizens the industry claims that its products comply with local laws and are used to fight crime and terror but in many countries around the world these tools have proved to be equally adept at political espionage on average an american office worker sends and receives roughly 120 emails per day a number that grows with each passing year the ubiquity and utility of email has turned it into a record of our lives rich with mundane and potentially embarrassing details stored in a perpetual archive accessible from anywhere on earth and protected in some cases by nothing more than a single password in the case of violeta lagunes her email login represented a point of vulnerability a seam where the digital walls protecting her campaign were at the mercy of her human judgment specifically whether she could determine if a message from an apparently reputable source was real or fake nearly two years later john podesta chairman of hillary clinton s campaign was faced with a similar judgment call an email warned him that someone in ukraine had tried to access his gmail account and asked him to click on a button and reset his password his senior adviser forwarded the email to one of the campaign s technology experts this is a legitimate email he replied in what the expert later would clarify was a simple typing error on his part he meant to say it was not legitimate the gmail one is real the senior adviser wrote to podesta and another aide and so like lagunes podesta fell into a trap the button appeared to lead to an official google page but it was in fact a meticulously personalized fake with a domain address linked to a remote cluster of atolls in the south pacific the details were designed to trick podesta into entering his password this technique is known as spear phishing it is an especially potent weapon against companies and political organizations because it needs to succeed only one time against one target after that attackers can use the trusted identity of the first compromised account to more easily lure colleagues into opening infected attachments or clicking on malicious links not only will a working email password yield years of intraoffice chatter invoices bills and confidential memos it can often be leveraged into control of other personal accounts twitter facebook amazon and even access to company servers and internet domains the podesta and lagunes episodes are far from the only cases in which hackers have used information from stolen emails as a weapon against an entire institution the 2009 climategate incident which exposed troves of emails from prominent climate researchers began when hackers remotely broke into servers at a british university with the help of illicitly obtained passwords the 2014 hack of internal sony files which american officials attributed to the north korean government began with a series of emails that attackers then used to dig deeper into sony s servers each hack yielded the most private thoughts and deeds from the members of each respective organization their blunt insults their quashed dissents their plans their smarmy flattery all chronicled in time down to the hundredth of the second when the author clicked send in an earlier era the hackers might have had to engage in riskier behavior like bribery or burglary now in many cases all they had to do was send along a link the white house c i a and f b i have all claimed that based on classified evidence they can trace the hacks of podesta s email account and other hacks of people close to the clinton campaign back to the russian government but with the rise of private firms like hacking team penetrating the email accounts of political opponents does not require the kind of money and expertise available to major powers a website called insider surveillance lists more than a dozen companies selling ethical malware including hacking team and the german firms finfisher and trovicor compared with conventional arms surveillance software is subject to few trade controls a recent attempt by the united states to regulate it under a pact called the wassenaar arrangement failed the technology is morally neutral says joel brenner a former inspector general of the national security agency the same program that you use to monitor your babysitter might be used by bashar assad or abdel fattah to keep track of whomever they don t like hacking team has fewer than 50 employees but it has customers all over the world according to internal documents its espionage tool which is called the remote control system or r c s can be licensed for as little as 200 000 a year well within the budget of a provincial strongman after it has been surreptitiously installed on a target s computer or phone the remote control system can invisibly eavesdrop on everything text messages emails phone and skype calls location data and so on whereas the n s a s programs grab data in transit from switching rooms and undersea cables the r c s acquires it at the source right off a target s device before it can be encrypted it carries out an invisible digitized equivalent of a the united states government is almost certainly the world s most formidable repository of hacking talent but its most powerful cyberweapons are generally reserved for intelligence agencies and the military this might explain why according to company documents at least two federal agencies have been hacking team clients the f b i beginning in 2011 and the drug enforcement administration beginning in 2012 the f b i contract paid hacking team more than 700 000 the d e a appears to have used the software to go after targets in colombia documents show that the company has also sold its software to some of the world s most repressive governments some like those of honduras ethiopia bahrain morocco egypt and saudi arabia are western allies other countries like uzbekistan and turkey have a more troubled relationship a few are openly hostile to the west between 2012 and 2014 hacking team was paid nearly one million euros by the government of sudan a united state sponsor of terrorism even more notable in light of recent events is the relationship that hacking team carried on with the f s b one of russia s main intelligence agencies as with puebla hacking team used a middleman a research agency called kvant to handle its sales to russia between 2012 and 2014 the agency paid hacking team 451 000 euros to license the remote control system hacking team claims that it draws the line at customers who commit gross abuses and that it sells exclusively to governments operating within the laws of their own countries in at least one case david vincenzetti hacking team s founder and chief executive told a salesman to hold off on a potential mexican client we sell to official governmental leas agencies and security agencies only vincenzetti wrote in an email but at other times a more casual attitude prevailed inside the company if one sells sandwiches to sudan he is not subject as far as my knowledge goes to the law one hacking team lawyer wrote in an internal email hacking team should be treated like a sandwich vendor when asked about its arrangements in various countries the company responded that it does not comment on confidential business dealings its american spokesman eric rabe did tell me that neither russia nor sudan is a current hacking team customer the relationships rabe wrote ended in 2014 russia because the putin government evolved from one considered friendly to the west to a more hostile regime and sudan because of concerns about the country s ability to use the system in accordance with the h t contract separately the company confirmed that the state of puebla was in fact a former client until recently most of what was known about the world of private surveillance companies was a matter of hearsay and speculation industry players kept a low profile operating discreetly from rented offices and meeting potential customers in person a few times a year at carefully screened trade shows this is why it was so notable when in july 2015 an unusual tweet appeared in hacking team s twitter feed since we have nothing to hide it read we re publishing all our emails files and source code then came another tweet with links to a downloadable file called hacked team the file was huge 420 gigabytes of material scraped from hacking team s internal servers inside were 33 folders containing the company s contracts payroll documents invoices legal memos records and a cache of email correspondence from the chief executive on down hacking team had itself been hacked wikileaks pounced on the breach and quickly uploaded the emails into a searchable database anyone with an internet connection could now read the chief executive joking about how his company was in the business of selling the evilest technology on earth you could browse hacking team s source code including one line using bomb blueprints pdf as a placeholder for files that might be found on a target s device on reddit an online peanut gallery formed around the online habits of one hacking team engineer and his own notably weak passwords htpassword p4ssword passw0rd but the most damaging exposures in the leak by far were hacking team s client list and the names of some of the clients targets in south korea newspapers focused on evidence suggesting that hacking team s software had helped the nation s intelligence service rig an election after the leak one agent who had reportedly used the system there committed suicide in ecuador a magazine found an email with seven phone numbers that the government appeared to have targeted with the r c s three belonged to lawmakers a fourth to the mayor of quito all four were members of the opposition party with the source code for the remote control system now public the company and its clients had to stop using it temporarily by the end of the year though hacking team had updated its product and was trying to rebuild its reputation i was curious whether a company that profited from online breaches could recover from its own eric rabe the american spokesman sounded eager to meet me for coffee in philadelphia a grandfather and former anchor he exudes credibility if you disagree with someone on the internet he said of the hacked team files with a wave of his hand there s no need to have a debate just go destroy them a couple of months later i went to milan to visit hacking team s headquarters a stately gray apartment building with boxes of limp flowers adorning a few of its sooty sills waiting to demonstrate the company s software were rabe philippe vinci a company vice president and alessandro scarafile a young engineer scarafile had gathered a dell desktop computer and three smartphones iphone blackberry and android the screen from his own laptop which represented the console of a client intelligence agency was projected on the wall several icons represented the various streams of data that could potentially be acquired by gaining control of the target s computer images from cameras sound from mikes screenshots detailed records of applications opened and bitcoins transferred a continuous log of location with latitude and longitude and logs of address books calendars phone calls skype calls and passwords as well as websites visited a key logger recorded every key that was pressed it was a lot to keep track of two other views called line of events and line of actions assembled the information into chronological order scarafile who was playing both the customer and the target or bad guy turned on the dell judging by the background on the desktop a gothic scene framed by castlelike silhouettes our target seemed to be planning a terrorist attack from transylvania there are three methods scarafile explained for getting the remote control system onto a target s device customers can gain physical access to the device and then infect it with a usb stick or memory card they can beam the r c s in over a network or they can send the customer an email and get him to click on an infected attachment usually a file from a program like microsoft word or powerpoint scarafile did not mention a fourth method one described by hacking team s critics and referred to in its internal emails the installation of the r c s through a more elaborate process called network injection which is said to involve pinpointing the target s exact location on the internet observing the person as he orders up say a youtube cat video and then serving up a doctored version of the same page one with the desired cat video playing in the foreground youtube logo and all as the r c s discreetly rolls in past the digital gates whatever the method of infection the malicious code known as an agent then communicates with its masters anonymously its dispatches routed through a series of dedicated servers scattered around the world even if the target gets suspicious and figures out that something is wrong this chain of servers makes it nearly impossible for him to figure out exactly who is using hacking team s product to spy on him for the demo scarafile opted for the third method which he referred to as a bit of social engineering using the customer s computer he sent the target an email with a word file attached then he returned to the target s computer and on it just as lagunes had clicked on the link in her inbox from now on he said this system is currently infected or monitored by the remote control system it would remain so even if the suspect turned off his machine or logged out on the timeline the target appeared as a stubbly lout in an undershirt named jimmy page head of the terrorist cell using jimmy page s dell scarafile logged into page s gmail facebook and twitter he opened up skype perused page s criminal colleagues don corleone harry potter keyser soze and left one of them a voice mail message from page s phone accessing a usb drive attached to the infected computer scarafile opened an encrypted file that turned out to contain an order to kill david vincenzetti r c s captured it all including periodic snapshots of scarafile as page at work i don t like the words inject and infect u2009 vinci the vice president said r c s is deploying the agent into the device of the target because you want to monitor some of his activities exactly the way that law enforcement is listening to some of your phone calls right rabe had told me that vincenzetti was a fighter and his combative side was apparent from a collage of magazine clippings and printouts taped to the wall beside his desk a sort of mood board like those used in the advertising industry to gather inspiration before the unveiling of a new brand vincenzetti s mood board though wasn t about sneakers or cola it was about the global struggle for power which he seemed to envision as one big conflict a battle between the good guys and the bad guys on the good side was a photo of the bell that aspiring navy seals can ring should they want to quit the program during hell week and a quote from another entrepreneur that business is war on the bad side vincenzetti had taped up a satellite image showing one of the hottest zones of international tension the artificial islands rising in the south china sea a line of terrestrial pawns advancing china s sphere of influence beside it was a chart about iran depicting how the country could continue to advance its nuclear program despite the recent deal i think the iran deal is just terrible vincenzetti said and then added sarcastically oh it s such a very peaceful expansion very peaceful that is not an official company position rabe interjected vincenzetti now 48 is a familiar type a ferociously competitive driven entrepreneur whose existence is organized around his work he has a wife who was born in morocco and no children his small eyes can make him seem sleepily blasé on the morning we met at hacking team s offices he wore jeans a cardigan and a striped shirt unbuttoned to midchest he seemed more comfortable on his feet than sitting down as we talked in a conference room he periodically leapt to his feet and stalked around the table considering in turn the espresso machine the view from the window a case of bottled water if i wanted to break into this room how would i do it he asked there is a door and there are two windows he pressed his hands against the glass panes the perimeter is the first thing you must secure he continued securing data was what he did earlier in his career now he had moved on if you cannot break into a bank you cannot protect a bank so when you are in security really there is no difference between thinking offensively and defensively in the vincenzetti s parents a salesman and a schoolteacher bought him a commodore 64 one of the earliest personal computers he soon created a clone a tron game and a adventure game as a student at the university of milan in the 90s he became fascinated by cryptography he corresponded with programmers around the world about new cryptographic theories and wrote code for email encryption in his senior year he was appointed to administer the university s internal network a post that was usually reserved for a graduate student vincenzetti remembers these early days as a time when everything was free and no one was trying to harm you we were wide open and accessible all the best were called hackers and i was a hacker vincenzetti left university early and founded three companies all of them focused on defensive cybersecurity after he founded hacking team in 2003 he tried to sell his services to italian police agencies but found them skeptical that mafiosi and other criminals would ever bother to encrypt their communications in italy the police were also used to getting whatever they needed through wiretaps arranged with varying degrees of formality through their contacts at telecommunications firms but after the 2004 madrid train bombings which were coordinated via cellphones and the internet police officers and intelligence agents not just in italy but all across europe became interested in contracting with vendors part of an emerging arms race over encryption the growth of skype made it easy for users to encrypt their communications and the authorities were eager to pay for countermeasures like the remote control system singapore hacking team s first client signed on in 2008 the company s middle eastern business took off in 2011 a boom that coincided with the beginning of the arab spring by then hacking team had entered a growth phase its business driven in part by demand among governments for surveillance tools according to two former employees the company held talks with col muammar s chief security officer who wanted to build a countrywide scheme that could be embedded in every libyan cellphone rabe would not confirm or deny that this meeting occurred and added the company often receives requests to provide services that it does not have available or would sell the united nations which prohibits the export of electronic weaponry to sudan has investigated hacking team s activities there nineteen members of the italian parliament signed a petition raising the question of whether the egyptian government might have used the r c s to track giulio regeni a italian student who appears to have been under government surveillance and whose mutilated body turned up on the side of a road in egypt last year hacking team s software has not been connected to the case but the company has done business with the current egyptian regime as part of the controversy the italian government temporarily revoked hacking team s global export license so that for several months the company had to file a separate application for each of its customers outside the european union when i brought up the regeni case with rabe he called the dead student this italian national who got himself killed in egypt he cited hacking team s official policy the company neither knows nor desires to know the identities of the people its customers choose to target there is no evidence that hacking team s software had anything to do with regeni s demise rabe said all hacking team customers sign contracts agreeing to comply with local laws the company says that it vets potential customers and studies reports from journalists and groups looking for objective evidence or credible concerns that its products are being abused but when it comes to hacking team s own interactions with customers leaked documents suggest that employees have sometimes turned a blind eye in the case of the puebla government and other latin american customers hacking team employees appeared to ignore warnings suggesting that the remote control system was being used to gather intelligence on the political opposition on multiple occasions customers emailed hacking team attachments with content including polling data party registration forms and invitations addressed to and signed by elected officials rather than ask what these files had to do with fighting crime and drug trafficking hacking team members simply emailed them back as requested with an embedded exploit turning the document into a surveillance tool to be used against whomever it was sent on to asked about these cases rabe replied that customers are not supposed to be using it for political purposes but i don t think it s reasonable to expect that an italian computer programmer i e a support technician would have seen these files and known what was going on i think that s a stretch that an italian software guy could know that an individual is a dissident hacking team s most persistent critic is citizen lab a research group at the university of toronto s munk school of global affairs before the hacked team leak citizen lab documented cases in which hacking team software turned up on the devices of activists in morocco and the united arab emirates as well as an journalist in alexandria va ronald deibert citizen lab s director told me that hacking team is a company that appears to have no internal controls on abuse of its products when i asked vincenzetti about this he said that citizen lab was motivated by money noting that the group won a grant a week after publishing a report on hacking team s sales to ethiopia their identity he said is i am the defender of free speech i am the defender of liberty and democracy o k so am i so is every rational guy if citizen lab really cared about good and evil he said it would be fighting china and iran almost immediately after the hacked team documents went online they were being pored over by r3d a mexico group luis fernando garcía r3d s director says that intimidation and online surveillance have increased under peña nieto s presidency and he took notice when citizen lab in 2014 released a report that traced a chain of servers associated with hacking team that routed data through hong kong london amsterdam and atlanta before terminating somewhere inside mexico exactly who was on the receiving end of the traffic and what they were doing with it was unknown at the time but now r3d s team recognized that this could be their chance to find out shortly thereafter r3d published three invoices from the hacked team cache showing that one state government that of jalisco on the pacific coast had paid the company nearly half a million euros for the remote control system soon other documents were found in the leak to implicate several more states including puebla though most of the states denied ever using the software jalisco later admitted to purchasing the system which it claimed was for its prosecutor s office the story failed to get much traction in the mexican press except in puebla after r3d connected with lado b a small collective there the site s name translates to b side as in the back of a hit single symbolizing its dedication to telling stories that would otherwise go untold lado b s editor ernesto aroche was not surprised that puebla s government had been using the remote control system in moreno valle s six years as governor there he has spent lavishly on new surveillance systems including multiple security arches structures that scrutinize traffic with video cameras and and whose cost had raised some questions in the local press beginning in 2013 aroche began noticing solicitations on the website for hidden cameras and other spying equipment when he filed a request about them the government s form response indicated that these orders had never been filled but aroche was skeptical given the mounting evidence that moreno valle s administration had begun using its security apparatus for political purposes there were periodic of homes belonging to dissident politicians and journalists with the burglars sometimes taking little besides their victims laptops politicians would answer calls from unknown numbers only to hear their own taped conversations played back to them another journalist fernando maldonado received an unmarked envelope full of what were purportedly transcripts of 400 private phone calls made by puebla politicians as aroche and r3d sifted through the hacked team file dump they discovered that the files on puebla had more detail than those dealing with hacking team s other mexican accounts the puebla client often wrote emails asking for help with infecting a particular document with a malicious virus some of these came from an account soporteuiamx gmail com that also appears in many of hacking team s internal support tickets one of those tickets documents a client s request for help in infecting an attachment an invitation to attend an event for a mexican political organization signed by violeta lagunes and addressed to another party colleague opposed to the governor aroche interviewed politicians and journalists who were on the receiving end of the infected emails contained in the hacked team trove according to a 2015 article that lado b published in conjunction with a politics website the puebla group sent hacking team at least 47 requests to infect specific files that it would then forward on to their targets almost all of those files had to do with political issues going through the hacked team materials aroche found the name of a puebla government employee who seemed to be working within the spying operation before we had been talking about ghosts aroche told me now we could prove it we started putting names on the actors more than a year later there have been no political repercussions for the governor or his allies in puebla i met aroche this fall at the lado b offices a small room facing a courtyard in a crumbling stone building from puebla s colonial days the only suggestion of lado b s presence was a small sticker on the window inside aroche was thumbing through an envelope of documents that he had wrung out of the state government two redacted contracts signed by puebla officials showed an arrangement between the state government and a company called sym servicios integrales which aroche s reporting had identified as an intermediary for hacking team the details of what had been purchased were redacted these contracts demonstrate that the puebla government had a commercial relationship with this company aroche said i m sorry if they re a little bit stained i dropped some coffee on them sym servicios integrales says it never sold h t technology to the state of puebla in a brief written statement from sagrario conde valerio a spokeswoman the government of puebla denied allegations of spying and claimed that no relationship exists nor has ever existed between the government of puebla and the company hacking team u2009 the government declined to respond further to a list of questions but a former official from moreno valle s administration claimed to me that more than 1 million was being diverted from the state budget each year to fund the unit documents from the hacked team archive indicate that hacking team received an order from the government of puebla for 415 000 euros in the spring of 2013 and that hacking team booked hotel rooms for three of its associates who traveled to puebla in may of that year some of the r c s training i was told took place in a green building on a residential street when i visited the purported site this fall lettering above the door said that the building was once a school now it had bars across the door and mirrored windows neighbors told me it had been abandoned for several months people would come and go one woman said they were very secretive they would drop off equipment take away equipment then one day about a year ago they came and took everything away and left another neighbor said that he often saw a car parked in front of the house and a man with a limp entering and leaving a former mexican intelligence agent according to someone who was present during the hacking team training mexico is hacking team s biggest export market accounting for nearly six million euros in sales according to leaked documents ostensibly the remote control system is intended for fighting criminals and drug traffickers there there have been reports that the software was used in the apprehension of chapo guzman rabe told me referring to the mexican drug lord i can t confirm it the files indicate that at least seven other mexican state governments were hacking team clients but because they did not use email to the same extent as puebla their activities are harder to track multiple former hacking team employees told me that abuses of the software were not limited to puebla one former employee described having the system set up inside a mayor s office katitza rodríguez director at the electronic frontier foundation says that mexican law allows for interception of communication like the wiretapping of phone lines but it does not grant precise legal authority to use new powerful invasive tools like those created by hacking team and she argues that it is much more dangerous in mexico than in other western countries where checks and balances are stronger this is much more intrusive than the interception of a phone call she said they are not only listening they are taking over your laptop mexico needs to have a full debate in congress about what legal safeguards are needed for this kind of surveillance or if the government should be using it at all the hacked team files indicate that in hacking team opened an american subsidiary and leased office space in reston va a drive from the c i a s headquarters the company drew up a u s action plan calling for a significant north american expansion with new hires and rounds of pitches to the department of justice the united states military and the royal canadian mounted police hacking team was also targeting another potentially lucrative market american state and local governments it pitched the r c s to agencies in san bernardino calif washington new york fort lauderdale and orlando in a risk assessment commissioned by the company lawyers advised that such sales were probably legal so long as the product was provided at a distance from actual investigations and used in the normal course of government operations american expansion by companies like hacking team may not face much resistance from the federal government which is becoming more accepting of electronic surveillance as part of normal police work last year the justice department successfully changed the rules of criminal procedure making it easier for federal agents to hack into multiple computers with a single warrant senator steve daines of montana who tried to block the change complained that it gives unlimited power for unlimited hacking in a 2014 address now referred to in cybersecurity circles as his going dark speech the f b i s director james comey argued that the encryption built into apple products posed a threat to public safety enabling not only terrorism but also drug trafficking child abuse and instead of a safe that can t be cracked comey wanted technology companies to lend him the combination the law hasn t kept pace with technology and this disconnect has created a significant problem comey said we call it going dark u2009 as the united states government has argued for weaker protections around personal communications american businesses have been spreading more powerful surveillance tools around the world many foreign agencies already buy products from ss8 a company backed by the storied firm kleiner perkins caufield byers as well as from the harris corporation a 13 billion company based in florida and traded on the new york stock exchange at least 25 american police departments have used harris s stingray device which mimics cellphone towers and can intercept cellphone calls within 200 meters all known sales of stingrays to local law enforcement have been authorized by the f b i which has since fought in court to keep those sales secret in baltimore alone stingrays have been used more than 4 000 times in routine drug investigations much less is known about another harris product the advanced hailstorm which is also sold to local police departments hailstorm is reportedly capable of implanting malware that can take control of a targeted phone much like hacking team s r c s the hacked team documents that offer the most revealing view of the company s ethos happen to be the most public ones for years as often as two or three times a day vincenzetti sent mass emails to hundreds of his business contacts the recipients included numerous members of the united states military and intelligence community as well as government employees from the city of cincinnati and the internal revenue service in these messages vincenzetti often addresses this audience collectively as gents the news he cites is a reminder of how the geopolitical winds have been blowing in favor of hacking team and other allies of law and order in vincenzetti s world the system is always as george tenet famously said about 11 intelligence blinking red the imploding middle east a restive russia battalions of jihadis roaming around europe with their encrypted thumb drives and expertise against this backdrop of danger concerns about human rights are naïve at best vincenzetti s emails vividly exploit this sense of danger and alarm he writes about shadowy gangs of iranian hackers using the jesuischarlie hashtag to inject malware into french laptops he celebrates the conviction of ross ulbricht a k a the dread pirate roberts creator of the silk road website after the arrests of two uzbek men in brooklyn for telling informants that they wanted to join up with isis vincenzetti writes of a very serious terrorist plot on american soil foiled he went on to tap out this sales pitch the following day he gave a few more hints the tone of vincenzetti s sales patter was strangely upbeat especially considering his dire forecasts it was almost as if he were in the business of selling microwave ovens or sandwiches not tools through which the private lives of criminals and whoever else could be fully laid bare vincenzetti s unstated equation privacy is secrecy and secrecy is terrorism is less controversial than it might appear a supportive echo can be heard in many public statements from american officials which vincenzetti often cut and pasted into his mass emails the former attorney general eric holder called for investigative and prosecutorial tools that allow us to be when comey warned that encryption threatens to lead all of us to a very dark place vincenzetti forwarded it along approvingly with the tagline we do have an answer to many if not all of his concerns and when in may 2015 comey warned of a threat that had morphed into a chaotic spider web vincenzetti sent word to his gents as well one month later an anonymous hack revealed hacking team s own invisible spider web and one year later during the to election day came the internal emails of the democratic party by then it was clear that tools for digital burglary had spread well beyond the hands of regular police officers comey had argued for weaker safes vincenzetti was selling longer crowbars they could be used to chase jimmy page arrest chapo guzman fight crime smear a political opponent or just keep tabs on someone anyone to be hidden is to be a terrorist this was the heart of his pitch any digital redoubt that could resist being pried open was a public risk and a private opportunity ',\n",
       " 'it hasn t been a great time to be a man without a job the jobs that have been disappearing like machine operator are predominantly those that men do the occupations that are growing like health aide employ mostly women one solution is for the men who have lost jobs in factories to become health aides but while more than a fifth of american men aren t working they aren t running to these new jobs why they require very different skills and pay a lot less they re also seen as women s work which has always been devalued in the american labor market the two occupations predicted by the bureau of labor statistics to decline most quickly from 2014 to 2024 are locomotive firers shrinking 70 percent and vehicle electronics installers and repairers down 50 percent they are 96 percent and 98 percent male of the jobs many are various types of health aides which are about 90 percent female when men take these jobs they have more job security and wage growth than in work according to recent research but they are paid less and feel stigmatized the jobs being created are very different than the jobs being eliminated said david autor an economist at m i t i m not worried about whether there will be jobs i m very worried about whether there will be jobs for adults especially the males who seem very reluctant to take the new jobs take tracy dawson 53 a welder in st clair mo he lost several jobs some because his employers took the work to china and mexico and others because the workers were replaced by robots he has heard the promises of jobs in the health care field his daughter trained to be a medical technician but he never considered it i ain t gonna be a nurse i don t have the tolerance for people he said i don t want it to sound bad but i ve always seen a woman in the position of a nurse or some kind of health care worker i see it as more of a woman s touch also health aides earn a median wage of 10 50 an hour mr dawson used to earn 18 an hour making railroad traction motors i was a welder that s all i know how to do said mr dawson who is living on disability insurance because he has rheumatoid arthritis women were hit harder than men by the decline in jobs according to mr autor but they have more easily moved into the expanding occupations and earn more college degrees than men women have always entered fields usually professional ones more than men enter ones there are now many female lawyers but male nurses are still rare one reason is that jobs done by women especially caregiving jobs have always had lower pay and lower status yet when men especially white men enter fields they are paid more and promoted faster than women a phenomenon known as the glass escalator much of men s resistance to jobs is tied up in the culture of masculinity say people who study the issue women are assumed to be empathetic and caring men are supposed to be strong tough and able to support a family traditional masculinity is standing in the way of men s employment and i think it s a problem said andrew cherlin a sociologist and public policy professor at johns hopkins and author of labor s love lost the rise and fall of the family in america we have a cultural lag where our views of masculinity have not caught up to the change in the job market he said but telling men to take feminine jobs plays to their anxieties and comes off as condescending said joan williams a law professor at u c hastings and author of reshaping the debate why men and class matter white men s wages have plummeted and what happens to men in that context is anxieties about whether they re real men she said it s no surprise then that donald j trump appealed to men who feel this way not just his promises to bring back factory jobs but also his machismo many unemployed men who did manual labor say they can t take the time and make the effort to train for a new career because they have bills to pay and they say they chose their original careers because they wanted to build things not take care of people lawrence katz an economist at harvard has a term for this retrospective wait unemployment or looking for the job you used to have it s not a skill mismatch but an identity mismatch he said it s not that they couldn t become a health worker it s that people have backward views of what their identity is jon ray 31 of inez ky was an electrician at a coal mine until it was shuttered a year ago he applied unsuccessfully for maintenance and repair jobs and got a job in manufacturing after enrolling in a program to learn how to operate computerized tools jobs weren t an option he said i couldn t afford to go back to school he said and i m used to working with my hands if more men do jobs they could erase the stigma and turn them into men s jobs said janette dill a sociologist at the university of akron at least for jobs that require less caregiving more men will go into care because they don t have a choice but they re going to carve out spaces for themselves that feel less like women s work she said ms dill was a of a study published in april that looked at what happens when men move into jobs in the health care field men in the health jobs like the nursing assistants who change patients sheets and help them bathe earned 10 percent less than men in jobs but they were less likely to be laid off and their wages rose over time while wages were stagnant technical health care jobs like ultrasound technician requiring more training but not a college degree paid 22 percent more than other jobs after controlling for things like education they involve less interaction with patients and more with computers so they are less stereotypically feminine there is an education and race divide among the men who take these jobs the study found black men were 3 3 times as likely as white men to take the health jobs and other minority men were 1 8 times as likely white men were more likely to take the technical jobs for men without college degrees more technical training that equips them for those jobs could help and if health aide jobs paid more and offered better benefits they d probably attract more men some hospitals are trying to make caregiving jobs seem manly like with a recruitment poster comparing the adrenaline rush of being an operating room nurse to mountain climbing perhaps then men could take the same pride in their work that mr dawson the unemployed welder showed when he talked about making pilings for the rebuilt world trade center i had a good life as a welder he said it always amused me that s one reason i picked the job ',\n",
       " 'apple complying with what it said was a request from chinese authorities removed news apps created by the new york times from its app store in china late last month the move limits access to one of the few remaining channels for readers in mainland china to read the times without resorting to special software the government began blocking the times s websites in 2012 after a series of articles on the wealth amassed by the family of wen jiabao who was then prime minister but it had struggled in recent months to prevent readers from using the app apple removed both the and apps from the app store in china on dec 23 apps from other international publications including the financial times and the wall street journal were still available in the app store for some time now the new york times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in china and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations fred sainz an apple spokesman said of the times apps as a result the app must be taken down off the china app store when this situation changes the app store will once again offer the new york times app for download in china mr sainz declined to comment on what local regulations the times apps were said to have violated who had contacted apple and when and whether a court order or other legal document had been presented china s main internet regulator the cyberspace administration of china did not respond to faxed questions the times bureau in beijing said it had not been contacted by the chinese government about the matter a times spokeswoman in new york eileen murphy said the company had asked apple to reconsider its decision the request by the chinese authorities to remove our apps is part of their wider attempt to prevent readers in china from accessing independent news coverage by the new york times of that country coverage which is no different from the journalism we do about every other country in the world ms murphy said in a statement the request appears to have been made under regulations released in june 2016 called provisions on the administration of mobile internet application information services the regulations say apps cannot engage in activities prohibited by laws and regulations such as endangering national security disrupting social order and violating the legitimate rights and interests of others the cyberspace administration says on its website that apps also cannot publish prohibited information the ruling communist party tightly controls media inside china and employs one of the world s most sophisticated systems of internet censorship chinese law prohibits the publication of harmful information online and officials often take action without legal procedures or court orders against material they deem objectionable apple has previously removed other less prominent media apps from its china store it is unclear how the company evaluates requests from beijing to take down apps and whether it ever resists them apple s chief executive timothy d cook has said that the company complies with all local laws while in early 2016 apple resisted a court request in the united states for it to help federal officials unlock an iphone for a criminal investigation mr cook said he would obey whatever order the court ultimately handed down in the end the government was able to unlock the device without apple s help and the case was dropped farzana aslam associate director of the center for comparative and public law at the university of hong kong noted that in matters involving customer privacy apple requires governments to submit subpoenas search warrants or other legal documents maybe in the end they have to do it but i think there s something to be said about standing up for what you believe in and purporting to put principle before profit in a country like china to show that actually there is this tension there ms aslam said it s not as simple as because we operate in your jurisdiction we ll do anything you ask of us she added that it was very worrying that apple had not disclosed what laws the authorities said were violated making it difficult for the times and other publishers to file an appeal or challenge the government s requests in the weeks leading up to the withdrawal of the times apps the times was working on various articles related to the chinese government one of them posted online on dec 29 revealed the billions of dollars in hidden perks and subsidies that the chinese government provides to the world s biggest iphone factory china is also one of apple s largest iphone markets though sales in that region have slowed on dec 23 david barboza a times reporter spoke with members of apple s media team about the article mr barboza had previously been in touch with the iphone factory owner foxconn he had also contacted the chinese government as part of his reporting later that day a separate team from apple informed the times that the apps would be removed ms murphy said in another article published on dec 22 as a post on its sinosphere blog the times described an internet video that had been widely promoted by chinese public security offices the times news apps remain available in apple s app stores for other countries as well as the hong kong and taiwan stores but people must have a credit card with a billing address outside mainland china to download them the times crossword puzzle and virtual reality apps remain available throughout china when the chinese government began blocking the times websites in 2012 it also prevented users with times apps from downloading new content but readers in china can still gain access to the times using software that circumvents the government s firewall and in july 2015 the times released a new version of its app that adopted a different method for retrieving articles one that the government appeared unable to stop apple s decision to remove the app from its china store should not affect those who have already installed it but users in china will not be able to download new releases unless they use another region s app store the times discovered after being blocked in 2012 that hackers with possible ties to the chinese military had targeted the newspaper s computer systems and that the attacks coincided with the reporting for that times investigation foreign tech companies face increasing pressure from government authorities in china in april apple s ibooks store and itunes movies were shut down in the country just six months after they were introduced there mark natkin the managing director of marbridge consulting who advises american technology firms in china said he did not think any such company entering the chinese market

       " 'washington federal reserve officials expect donald j trump s election to result in somewhat faster economic growth over the next several years but they see little chance of the boom mr trump has promised according to an account of the fed s most recent meeting in that is in part because the fed plans to raise interest rates more quickly if growth accelerates for now however fed officials plan to wait and see what happens next the account said while the fed signaled that it would likely respond to expansionary fiscal policies with a faster pace of rate hikes the fed believes it is too early to embed this into its baseline michael gapen chief united states economist at barclays wrote on wednesday following the release of the minutes any real shift in the stance of monetary policy will require more clarity on the stance of fiscal policy at the december meeting the fed raised its benchmark rate for just the second time since 2008 citing the continued expansion of the economy and the steady decline of unemployment the fed debated and delayed that increase for most of last year but the account published on wednesday after a standard delay described the final decision as uncontroversial officials instead spent the meeting talking about what comes next mr trump has promised a bevy of major changes in economic policy including tax cuts and spending increases reductions in regulation and restrictions on trade and immigration as a result the account said fed officials regard both faster growth and slower growth as more likely than before the election when the economy seemed locked into its longstanding pattern of slow and steady growth the job of conducting u s monetary policy has not become any easier over recent months said james marple senior economist at td bank referring to the increased uncertainty the fed led by janet l yellen the chairwoman predicted in december that it would raise rates three times this year the account said officials were not yet ready to predict how the pace of rate increases might change as a result of new policies pursued by mr trump and congress participants emphasized their uncertainty about the timing size and composition of any future fiscal and other economic policy initiatives as well as about how those policies might affect aggregate demand and supply the minutes said the fed s committee the federal open market committee has 17 members 10 of whom cast votes on monetary policy the fed s caution amounts to a bias in favor of growth the economy is expanding at roughly the pace fed officials regard as sustainable the work force is growing slowly as more baby boomers retire and productivity is rising slowly two percent growth may be about as good as it gets ms yellen has warned that fiscal stimulus like a tax cut or a spending increase could increase economic growth to an unsustainable pace in the near term resulting in increased inflation the fed quite likely would seek to offset such policies by raising interest rates more quickly instead of acting the fed is choosing to wait for more information but the minutes said officials were concerned about the challenge of communicating their increased uncertainty they want to be clear that the fed s prediction about the pace of rate increases depends on its prediction about economic growth faster growth will mean faster increases the account said fed officials were confident in their ability to raise rates quickly enough to prevent overheating seeing only a modest risk of a sharp acceleration in prices by holding rates at low levels the fed has sought to increase economic growth by encouraging borrowing and higher rates reduce the stimulative effect the benchmark rate now sits in a range from 0 5 percent to 0 75 percent still very low by historical standards consumers have no reason to panic about the rate hike last month or even about additional rate increases in 2017 said alan maceachin chief corporate economist at navy federal credit union he noted that the last rate hike would add 1 to the monthly payment on a 5 000 credit card balance the economic forecast prepared by the fed s staff for the december meeting anticipated that mr trump s election would result in slightly higher growth over the next several years it said a likely increase in fiscal stimulus would be substantially counterbalanced by higher interest rates and a stronger dollar which would reduce exports of american goods and services several fed officials reported that mr trump s election had increased optimism among business executives in their districts some contacts thought that their businesses could benefit from possible changes in federal spending tax and regulatory policies the minutes said the minutes also noted however that some executives were concerned about the negative impact of proposed policy changes in a recent interview john williams president of the federal reserve bank of san francisco said many executives in his district which encompasses the western united states worried about the potential impact of restrictions on immigration and on foreign trade both of which have been important drivers of regional growth businesses across the country also reported increased difficulty in hiring qualified workers the minutes said the unemployment rate fell to just 4 6 percent in november the lack of readily available workers could further limit the benefits of a fiscal stimulus ',\n",

foundation one of the country s largest and most influential philanthropies will name mr shah to succeed judith rodin who has been president for 12 years the appointment will make mr shah one of the most powerful forces in charitable giving overseeing a foundation that donates roughly 200 million each year and corrals governments companies and organizations to contribute money and resources in tandem mr shah 43 will be the first to lead the rockefeller foundation which has gained stature in recent years through some prominent projects but has sometimes been criticized as being more interested in its publicity than its grantees founded in 1913 by the oil tycoon john d rockefeller the foundation says it has given away the equivalent of more than 17 billion in today s dollars its first grant was to the american red cross and it went on to play pivotal roles in establishing the field of public health creating vaccines for yellow fever and malaria and bringing agricultural advances to the developing world in recent years the foundation has focused on the themes of resilience and inclusive economies that has resulted in programs aimed at establishing resilience officers

health and in africa aiding economic development in impoverished areas and developing strategies to combat climate change it was these diverse causes that attracted mr shah to the job with advanced degrees in medicine and health finance from the university of pennsylvania mr shah worked at the bill melinda gates foundation for nearly a decade rising to be director for agricultural development from 2009 to 2015 he ran u s a i d leading the response to disasters including the 2010 earthquake in haiti and the 2014 ebola outbreak in west africa after leaving the agency he founded latitude

marvel ms rodin said in an interview this week he s very strategic and very innovative he shows an interpersonal dexterity that is well beyond his years ms rodin said she believed that mr shah was a good fit for the job thanks in part to his time at u s a i d which required that he forge alliances with a vast array of governments organizations and companies one of the things we tried to emphasize during my time at rockefeller was broadening the scope of partnerships ms rodin said we see in raj someone who has the capacity to take advantage of this and has the capacity to be a great partner

the perfect guy to come in after her mr parsons said in an interview he s a performer you put him up in front of a group and people come away impressed now he s got a platform mr shah said he was committed to the broad themes of resilience and inclusive economies that core concept of resilience is extraordinarily important going forward he said it gives us the opportunity to evolve into the future but he said he would look for opportunities to address schisms in the american electorate in this divisive political moment it is a different time today than it was 10 or 15 years ago he said we live in a more fractured world the rockefeller foundation is viewed by some has having a liberal bent during ms rodin s tenure the foundation donated money to the clinton foundation mr shah is close with president obama but said he maintained good relations with republicans in the house and senate and believed that the foundation s core mission had bipartisan appeal it s widely acknowledged that tackling hunger and ensuring health around the globe are in our own national interest mr shah said i have always been passionate about delivering social justice results at a massive scale he will now have a 200 million a year to try to deliver those results ',\n",

       " 'doral fla inside a clandestine carnival corporation complex here two former disney executives have been plotting a drastic cruise industry overhaul their mission take lessons learned at walt disney world where they helped bring about a 1 billion vacation management system involving bracelets that link to personal information and apply them to cruises the result millions of passengers on carnival ships will soon be using a similar but more advanced system that allows travelers to do everything from plan vacations to open stateroom doors to order poolside cocktails as long as bigger newer cooler ships have kept coming the cruise industry has treated guest liabilities standing in long lines having a frustrating embarkation experience as acceptable said john padgett who joined carnival in 2014 as chief experience and innovation officer after 18 years at disney that thinking stops now carnival which operates more than 100 ships worldwide under 10 brands will unveil its ambitious technology initiative on thursday at the consumer electronics show in las vegas in a keynote speech arnold w donald carnival s chief executive intends to announce that the system an app called ocean compass paired with a smart medallion that can be carried in a pocket or worn as jewelry will arrive on the company s princess cruises fleet this year mr donald declined in an interview to give a timeline for bringing the technology code name trident to other carnival brands but he emphasized that rolling out the personalized disks and app was a companywide priority the cost is in the hundreds of millions of dollars and over time more than that mr donald said people want the world to be organized around them on vacation even more so analysts expect the technology to increase profits in multiple ways including allowing carnival to charge more for tickets particularly on older ships ease of purchase is another big component cruisers will be able to pay for food drinks and merchandise simply by having their credit ocean medallion in their pocket carnival s disks each with the guest s name will also power a new shipwide gambling platform and carnival gift shops will be stocked with a wide array of jewelry clips and key chains that passengers can buy to carry and display their disks carnival s top rival royal caribbean cruises already offers smartbands on ships like the anthem of the seas called wow bands they serve as room keys allow for wireless payment and make it faster and easier to embark and disembark but carnival says that its offering takes such systems much further in part because its technology is designed to be invisible unlike with smartbands there is no need to tap a sensor on a stateroom door for entry simply approaching the correct room with the ocean medallion in your pocket will unlock the door among the medallion system s other offerings is a navigation tool designed to help family members find one another on the ships under mr donald who took over carnival in after a string of ship debacles the company has boomed in the most recent quarter carnival had a record 1 4 billion in net income a 17 percent increase from the same period a year earlier but he remains under pressure to recruit new customers about 24 2 million people worldwide took a cruise in 2016 according to the cruise lines international association that sounds like a lot but cruise vacations only represent about 2 percent of all vacations said david beckel an analyst at bernstein research because there is such a low penetration rate any increase in penetration even a minor minor one represents a big difference and hence the effort to improve the customer experience mr beckel said as part of its ocean medallion plan carnival has turned to television paying to produce three travel shows designed to make cruising look fun and easy the shows has been broadcast on weekends in recent months on abc nbc and the cw in one episode of the voyager with josh garcia the host is seen chatting with artists in puerto rico about making masks from coconuts carnival plans to produce at least 80 episodes in total analysts have praised the effort people have a lot of preconceived notions about cruising that largely aren t true said robin m farley an analyst for ubs the system that carnival plans to introduce on thursday still has a lot to prove the technology will require the mass retraining of employees and substantial retrofitting of ships including the installation of roughly 7 000 sensors per boat and do passengers really want to sacrifice privacy for personalization one feature will allow guests to watch live entertainment in ship lounges on their stateroom televisions and the performers will know who is watching and will be trained to do hello to brooks tuning in from his bed on the promenade deck mr padgett acknowledged that some guests will have creepiness factor questions but he expects the vast majority to participate as long as you benefit the guest they don t mind sharing personal information he said using the connected app guests can order food to be delivered wherever they plan to be at a designated time waiters will know who you are because your photograph will pop up on an device when they get close to your medallion by loading preferences into the app while still at home carnival will be able to offer tailored lists of activities the goal of preplanning is learning more about our guests said michael g jungen who joined carnival in 2015 as vice president for design and technology after 15 years at disney he noted that passengers would have the option of linking their medallions with social media accounts allowing carnival to delve even deeper as carnival designed the ocean medallion system inside an unmarked building here in suburban miami it built a replica set of staterooms corridors and other ship facilities to test concepts scribbles on a monumental white board in one area contained algorithms and personalization ideas what time you eat dinner what channels you watch when they were leading disney s technology effort in 2013 mr padgett and mr jungen built a similar laboratory experimenting with ideas that ultimately became mymagic the theme park wristband system that serves as wallet room key admission ticket photograph collector and pass as he gave a reporter a tour of the carnival site mr padgett continually returned to the topic of disney how the cost of cruising compares with a family trip to disney world and how disney frames vacations as overarching stories the ultimate goal here he said turning to a disney phrase is to delight and surprise our guests ',\n",

       " 'london maybe it wasn t just the iceberg ever since the titanic sank more than 104 years ago killing more than 1 500 men women and children mystery has swirled around the tragedy no one doubts that the ship collided at high speed with an iceberg off the coast of newfoundland but a new documentary posits that the sinking of the ship hailed at the time as the largest ever built and praised for its professed unsinkability may have been accelerated by a giant coal fire in its hull that appeared to have started as long as three weeks before it set off on its fateful journey to new york from southampton england in the documentary which was broadcast on channel 4 in britain on new year s day senan molony an irish journalist who has spent more than 30 years researching the titanic contends that the fire in a bunker next to one of the ship s boiler rooms damaged its hull helping to seal its fate long before it slammed into the iceberg it s a perfect storm of extraordinary factors coming together fire ice and criminal negligence he argues in the documentary titanic the new evidence which will air in the united states on the smithsonian channel on january 21 the fire was known about but it was played down she should never have been put to sea mr molony s potential breakthrough can be traced to an attic in wiltshire in southwest england where a previously unpublished album of photographs chronicling the ship s construction and the preparations for its maiden voyage had been gathering dust for more than a century the photographs were discovered by a descendant of a director of the company harland and wolff that built the titanic about four years ago a collaborator of mr molony s acquired the rare photographs of the ship meticulously taken by harland and wolff s engineering chief before it left a belfast shipyard when the two men looked closely at the images mr molony said they were shocked to discover a diagonal black mark on the hull s front starboard side close to where the ship was pierced by the iceberg an analysis by engineers at imperial college london subsequently revealed that the mark was most likely caused by a fire in a coal bunker of the ship mr molony called the photographs the titanic equivalent of tutankhamen s tomb because of the richness of historical detail they conveyed including the mark highlighting the extent of the damage experts said the theory was compelling but were divided over how important a role the fire may have played in an interview richard de kerbrech a marine engineer based on the isle of wight who has written two books on the titanic disaster said that the fire would have damaged the ship s bulkhead a wall of steel within the ship s hull and made it more vulnerable after it was pierced by an iceberg an official british inquiry in 1912 mentioned the fire but the judge who presided over it whom critics saw as sympathetic to shipping interests played it down this discovery is a revelation and could change our knowledge of the history of what happened mr de kerbrech said mr molony contends that the ship s owners knew about the fire but chose to let it go since delaying the ship s journey would have been financially ruinous at the time of departure the ship was berthed so that the marks caused by the fire were facing the sea away from the dock and therefore concealed from passengers the titanic disaster has long fanned conspiracy theories among them that it was not the titanic that sank on april 15 1912 but rather the olympic its sister ship that the titanic was torpedoed by a german or that the ship was brought down by a sarcophagus containing an egyptian priestess s mummy popularized by hollywood the story of the titanic continues to exert a hold on popular culture construction of a replica recently began at a theme park in china mr molony said his fascination took root when he was 12 and was gripped by a night to remember walter lord s 1955 book recounting the titanic s final night he said he was so captivated that he finished the book in two hours and 40 minutes the same time it took the titanic to sink now the political editor at the irish daily mail mr molony who has also written a book called the irish aboard titanic was also drawn to the social divisions reflected on the ship where cabins hosted millionaires while hundreds of passengers many of them irish stayed below mr molony said he believed the fire had been played down in part because death by iceberg was a more dramatic explanation the ship was seen as a heroic unsinkable ship and as a result people focused on explanations that fed that narrative he said not everyone is convinced david hill a former honorary secretary of the british titanic society who has been studying the cause of the sinking since the 1950s argued that while the damage caused by the fire to the steel walls protecting the hull may have hastened the disaster the blaze was not the decisive factor when the titanic hit the iceberg close to midnight on april 14 1912 it created a line of damage on the starboard section of the hull including punctures and gashes that opened up too many compartments to the sea so that the weight of the water dragged the bow down so low that the ship eventually sank he said a fire may have accelerated this but in my view the titanic would have sunk anyways he added it amazes me how this ship still captures the global imagination it was not the catastrophe at sea but it is the one everyone remembers ',\n",

the classrooms are frugally equipped behind windows protected by vertical and horizontal bars although one has brightly colored paintings covering the walls but none of that deterred marco albanese a police officer for 19 years and a trained sommelier for five from teaching a class of rapt students the finer points of deconstructing the bouquet of a chardonnay or pouring a rare vintage mr albanese 43 is an instructor in an innovative effort at lecce penitentiary to teach inmates to be sommeliers or wine stewards the courses are part of a program to teach prisoners new professional skills as well as to help them develop a bond with the region which is renowned for its negroamaro grapes the program has been enthusiastically embraced by the prisoner students who were tasting white wines on a recent afternoon it has also been an eye opener for mr albanese i could see their human aspect once they were out of their context mr albanese who traded in his police uniform for the crisp blue jacket and tie of a sommelier for the class and i didn t have to keep the same distance now that i was their professor he added they also deserve a second chance and it s important that they know that the institutions do believe that they can be educated to a different life in eight lessons the group of 30 men and women who are instructed in separate classes learn how to taste choose and serve local wines we hope to teach them the social value of work and the preciousness of their own territory so that they can later choose to work here already having the right skill set said rita russo the director of lecce penitentiary which is the largest in the region of apulia inmates can also study for their high school diplomas cultivate tomatoes take theater classes and learn to be painters or tailors class begins with a slide show on the history of wine explaining how it was drunk by the ancient greeks and introducing the students to the roman ancestors of modern sommeliers in italy on a school table covered with a khaki tablecloth stood wine glasses ready for use three bottles of chardonnay a red primitivo and a negroamaro stood on a table nearby mr albanese then addressed the prisoners who sat facing him on stools listing the temperatures at which different wines should be served and how to store them in cellars for a finale he offered a tip do remember even if you had trump over for dinner the pope would still be served first the clergy does come first even before heads of state he said to raucous laughter the prisoners whose identity is being protected by the prison were not allowed to be interviewed or photographed for this article roberto giannone who works for the local sommelier association then demonstrated how to open a bottle neatly slicing off the capsule covering the bottleneck in three cuts inserting the corkscrew and smoothly pulling out the cork once the cork is out he said use a napkin to show it to your customers it s an easy way to be polite and avoid objections since the 1970s the italian penal system has focused on for inmates however a lack of funds for rehabilitation as well as chronic overcrowding means that thousands of incarcerated men and women have little to do all day that has sparked some innovative rehabilitation programs including a restaurant inside a prison near milan in which the waiters and cooks are inmates but the sommelier class at the lecce prison is believed to be unique in italy of course sommelier courses can t be considered a treatment said georgia zara the head of a program at the university of turin that offers a master s degree in criminological and forensic psychology but they do educate inmates and create social interaction which is very important the classes also offer a bridge between the jail context and the world outside so it s a small investment to reduce the risk of recidivism ms zara said gianvito rizzo 53 is the chief executive at the feudi di guagnano a local vintner that provides wine like negroamaro for the classes he is also the creator of the sommelier classes at the prison mr rizzo has proposed that inmates start working on his nearly 75 acres of vines in the coming year under certain circumstances some inmates in italy are allowed to work outside prisons i see wine in a democratic way mr rizzo said as he walked through his vineyard recently the countryside is the opposite to a cell you are free you smell nature and learn to care for it i think it d be good also for inmates to try it out mr rizzo said that when he had received a master s degree from the bocconi university business school in milan three decades ago he had been fixated on doing something for his native region of salento in apulia on the heel of the italian boot he settled on going into the wine business which had been struggling to convert farmers who cultivated for personal or local use into becoming larger producers he now produces 16 different wines from grapes grown in vineyards that he and two friends and business partners inherited from their fathers added to those that other friends asked them to cultivate on their behalf he calls this collaborative effort his first social experiment when mr rizzo heard about the penitentiary s activities for prisoners he proposed the sommelier classes to ms russo while it is unclear if any of the students will ever become professional sommeliers the exposure to the world of wine provided by the classes has been very welcome i don t even drink but i ve learned to sip it smell it and taste it

       " 'washington a united front of top intelligence officials and senators from both parties on thursday forcefully reaffirmed the conclusion that the russian government used hacking and leaks to try to influence the presidential election directly rebuffing donald j trump s repeated questioning of russia s role they suggested that the doubts mr trump has expressed on twitter about the agencies competence and impartiality were undermining their morale there s a difference between skepticism and disparagement james r clapper jr the director of national intelligence said at a hearing of the senate armed services committee on the russian hacks he added that our assessment now is even more resolute that the russians carried out the attack on the election the senate hearing was the prelude to an extraordinary meeting scheduled for friday when mr clapper and other intelligence chiefs will repeat for mr trump the same detailed highly classified briefing on the russian attack that president obama received on thursday in effect they will be telling the that the spy agencies believe he won with an assist from president vladimir v putin of russia then mr trump will have to say whether he accepts the agencies basic findings on russia s role or holds to his previous contention that inept politicized american spies have gotten the perpetrator of the hacking wrong that would throw the intelligence agencies into a crisis of credibility and status with few if any precedents in a pair of twitter posts early thursday mr trump appeared to back away from the scorn he had previously expressed for the intelligence agencies work as well as from his embrace of julian assange the founder of wikileaks which released most of the hacked emails of democratic officials the dishonest media likes saying that i am in agreement with julian assange wrong he wrote i simply state what he states it is for the people to make up their own minds as to the truth the media lies to make it look like i am against intelligence when in fact i am a big fan but on thursday night the returned to twitter and appeared to underscore his doubts about the f b i s investigation of the hacking the democratic national committee would not allow the fbi to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by russia he wrote a day after a report by buzzfeed on the issue so how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers what is going on early next week the public will get its fullest information to date on the evidence the agencies have to support their contention that mr putin s government used the hacked emails to hurt hillary clinton s campaign and help mr trump s mr clapper said he would push the envelope to include as much detail as possible in the unclassified version of the intelligence agencies report on the russian operation the hacking he added was only one part of that operation which also included the dissemination of classical propaganda disinformation fake news mr clapper will step down as intelligence director later this month after a career in intelligence and military service that began when he enlisted in the marine corps in 1961 his replacement is expected to be dan coats a retired senator from indiana a trump transition official said thursday a conservative who served on the senate intelligence committee mr coats would oversee the nation s 16 intelligence agencies in a job that was created after the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks to improve the sharing of information but that is sometimes criticized as adding a layer of bureaucracy the coats news came on the same day that r james woolsey a former c i a director stepped down as a senior adviser to mr trump citing his diminishing role in the transition the senate hearing on thursday devoted to foreign cyberthreats was unusual as much for its context as its content a public bipartisan display of support for the intelligence community that seemed aimed at times at an audience of one though mr clapper and most republican senators were careful to avoid antagonizing the directly the hearing spoke to the rift mr trump has threatened to create between the incoming administration and the intelligence officials assigned to inform it senator john mccain republican of arizona and chairman of the committee said the purpose of the gathering was not to question the outcome of the presidential election but to move forward with a full understanding of what had happened repeatedly though mr mccain and his colleagues seemed to undercut mr trump s past messages of support for russia and for mr assange of wikileaks do you think there s any credibility we should attach to this individual mr mccain asked not in my view mr clapper said another witness at the hearing adm michael s rogers the head of the national security agency and united states cyber command said he agreed the intelligence director said he welcomed skeptical questioning from mr trump allowing that the intelligence community was not perfect we are an organization of human beings and we re prone sometimes to make errors mr clapper said but he said the agencies had learned from their failures notably their declaration that iraq had weapons of mass destruction democrats on the committee repeatedly coaxed intelligence leaders to rebut mr trump s multiple assertions that a random individual hacker might have hacked democratic targets senator joe donnelly democrat of indiana told mr clapper that in the conflict between the intelligence agencies and mr assange over russian responsibility for the attack we re on your side every time he asked mr clapper to convey his level of confidence in attributing the election attack to russia rather than someone in his basement it s uh very high the laconic intelligence director replied at one point senator claire mccaskill democrat of missouri wondered aloud who benefits from a trashing the intelligence community ms mccaskill said there would be howls from the republican side of the aisle if a democrat had spoken about intelligence officials as mr trump had senator tim kaine democrat of virginia and mrs clinton s running mate used the occasion for an aside about lt gen michael t flynn mr trump s choice for national security adviser who has a history of sharing discredited news stories and conspiracy theories mr kaine said that he was unsure whether mr flynn was acting out of gullibility or malice but that it was a cause for great concern that mr flynn shared stories that most fourth graders would find incredible no republican lawmakers embraced mr trump s remarks casting doubt on the intelligence conclusions though some were more conspicuous than others in their efforts to distance themselves perhaps the closest to a defense of mr trump came from senator tom cotton republican of arkansas denouncing imprecise language stating that russia hacked the election mr cotton asked mr clapper to confirm that the actual balloting was not affected mr cotton also suggested that the conventional wisdom that mr putin favored mr trump over mrs clinton might be wrong mr trump promised a stronger military and more american oil and gas production policies mr cotton suggested would not be to russia s advantage senator lindsey graham republican of south carolina criticized the obama administration for its response to the russian attack he said the white house had lobbed mere pebbles in retaliation for the interference when it comes to interfering with our election we better be ready to throw rocks he said then mr graham issued a warning for fellow republicans who might be inclined to brush off any attack on an opposing party could it be republicans next election he asked it s not like we re so much better at cybersecurity than democrats ',\n",

served as a member of his chamber s intelligence committee known for a style mr coats was popular among his colleagues i always thought he should wear a red cardigan said senator cory gardner republican of colorado he was the closest thing to mister rogers we could come up with while fiscally conservative mr coats an indiana republican who completed his second senate stint this month often found common cause with democrats who described him as thoughtful on intelligence and national security issues with a sharp intellect and disarming humor i have always been impressed with his demeanor said senator angus king a maine independent who caucuses with the democrats and who served on the intelligence committee with mr coats and traveled with him in eastern europe he s not a fierce partisan and knows the intelligence community he s very amiable and easy to work with the position of america s top intelligence official was created by congress in 2004 as a response to criticism that the nation s spy agencies had failed to detect and prevent the terrorist attacks on sept 11 2001 since then the director has been charged with coordinating the and analysis of the country s 16 civilian and military spy agencies helping to prevent a terrorist attack and serving as a central liaison to presidents and their white house staff but bureaucratic turf wars have dogged the office of the director of national intelligence since its creation officials who run the c i a and the defense intelligence agency among others have sought to maintain control over parts of the spying apparatus and to exert influence with presidents and members of congress in 2009 for example leon e panetta president obama s incoming c i a director clashed with dennis c blair the director of national intelligence at the time after mr blair sought to select the top american spies for overseas postings mr panetta sent a dispatch to the agency s employees telling them to ignore mr blair s message an assertion that the c i a was in charge the rivalries have weakened the national intelligence office and led some critics in the government to question its effectiveness the year that mr obama took office an internal report criticized the office of national intelligence for adding to not removing bureaucratic bloat and doing little to end the tensions among the various spy agencies in 2010 james r clapper jr the current director of national intelligence insisted during his senate confirmation hearings that he would not be a hood ornament saying that despite the inherent limitations on his job he would try to bring an end to turf battles among the nation s spy agencies six years later the job appears to have limited appeal to some intelligence professionals several of whom were not eager to serve in the position for fear that they would not be empowered mr coats had been an early and strong contender for secretary of defense in the first term of president george w bush until mr bush s vice president dick cheney successfully pressed for donald h rumsfeld mr coats 73 graduated from wheaton college in illinois and served in the army before studying at the indiana university robert h mckinney school of law he began a career in life insurance in fort wayne ind before joining the office of dan quayle as a district representative mr coats owed much of his political career to his ties to mr quayle the former vice president mr coats won mr quayle s house seat in 1980 the year the latter was elected to the senate after mr quayle was elected vice president in 1988 mr coats was appointed to fill his seat he served on the senate armed services and intelligence committees in 1998 mr coats decided to not seek largely because the democratic challenger evan bayh was considered unbeatable in 2001 mr coats was named ambassador to germany arriving only three days before the sept 11 attacks ambassador coats found himself thrown into a role he couldn t have foreseen a day earlier a role in which he would excel but one that would forever change him senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky the republican leader said on the senate floor last year in remarks praising mr coats those who know dan coats say that day in september affected him profoundly he said he may not have known it then but he would feel the tug of that responsibility many years later and answer the call after a brief foray into lobbying mr coats returned to the senate in january 2011 serving again on the intelligence committee mr coats was also one of only a few republican senators who supported compelling congress to officially authorize the use of military force abroad you re asking our sons and daughters to take up our cause he said and every person who is here has to decide with their own

       " 'washington when special agent adrian hawkins of the federal bureau of investigation called the democratic national committee in september 2015 to pass along some troubling news about its computer network he was transferred naturally to the help desk his message was brief if alarming at least one computer system belonging to the d n c had been compromised by hackers federal investigators had named the dukes a cyberespionage team linked to the russian government the f b i knew it well the bureau had spent the last few years trying to kick the dukes out of the unclassified email systems of the white house the state department and even the joint chiefs of staff one of the government s networks yared tamene the contractor at the d n c who fielded the call was no expert in cyberattacks his first moves were to check google for the dukes and conduct a cursory search of the d n c computer system logs to look for hints of such a cyberintrusion by his own account he did not look too hard even after special agent hawkins called back repeatedly over the next several weeks in part because he wasn t certain the caller was a real f b i agent and not an impostor i had no way of differentiating the call i just received from a prank call mr tamene wrote in an internal memo obtained by the new york times that detailed his contact with the f b i it was the cryptic first sign of a cyberespionage and campaign devised to disrupt the 2016 presidential election the first such attempt by a foreign power in american history what started as an operation intelligence officials believe ultimately morphed into an effort to harm one candidate hillary clinton and tip the election to her opponent donald j trump like another famous american election scandal it started with a at the d n c the first time 44 years ago at the committee s old offices in the watergate complex the burglars planted listening devices and jimmied a filing cabinet this time the burglary was conducted from afar directed by the kremlin with emails and zeros and ones an examination by the times of the russian operation based on interviews with dozens of players targeted in the attack intelligence officials who investigated it and obama administration officials who deliberated over the best response reveals a series of missed signals slow responses and a continuing underestimation of the seriousness of the cyberattack the d n c s fumbling encounter with the f b i meant the best chance to halt the russian intrusion was lost the failure to grasp the scope of the attacks undercut efforts to minimize their impact and the white house s reluctance to respond forcefully meant the russians have not paid a heavy price for their actions a decision that could prove critical in deterring future cyberattacks the approach of the f b i meant that russian hackers could roam freely through the committee s network for nearly seven months before top d n c officials were alerted to the attack and hired cyberexperts to protect their systems in the meantime the hackers moved on to targets outside the d n c including mrs clinton s campaign chairman john d podesta whose private email account was hacked months later even mr podesta a savvy washington insider who had written a 2014 report on cyberprivacy for president obama did not truly understand the gravity of the hacking by last summer democrats watched in helpless fury as their private emails and confidential documents appeared online day after day procured by russian intelligence agents posted on wikileaks and other websites then eagerly reported on by the american media including the times mr trump gleefully cited many of the purloined emails on the campaign trail the fallout included the resignations of representative debbie wasserman schultz of florida the chairwoman of the d n c and most of her top party aides leading democrats were sidelined at the height of the campaign silenced by revelations of embarrassing emails or consumed by the scramble to deal with the hacking though by the public confidential documents taken by the russian hackers from the d n c s sister organization the democratic congressional campaign committee turned up in congressional races in a dozen states tainting some of them with accusations of scandal in recent days a skeptical the nation s intelligence agencies and the two major parties have become embroiled in an extraordinary public dispute over what evidence exists that president vladimir v putin of russia moved beyond mere espionage to deliberately try to subvert american democracy and pick the winner of the presidential election many of mrs clinton s closest aides believe that the russian assault had a profound impact on the election while conceding that other factors mrs clinton s weaknesses as a candidate her private email server the public statements of the f b i director james b comey about her handling of classified information were also important while there s no way to be certain of the ultimate impact of the hack this much is clear a weapon that russia had in elections from ukraine to europe was trained on the united states with devastating effectiveness for russia with an enfeebled economy and a nuclear arsenal it cannot use short of war cyberpower proved the perfect weapon cheap hard to see coming hard to trace there shouldn t be any doubt in anybody s mind adm michael s rogers the director of the national security agency and commander of united states cyber command said at a postelection conference this was not something that was done casually this was not something that was done by chance this was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily he said this was a conscious effort by a to attempt to achieve a specific effect

clinton supporter recalls walking into the busy clinton transition offices humiliated to see her face on television screens as pundits discussed a leaked email in which she had called mrs clinton s instincts suboptimal it was just a sucker punch to the gut every day ms tanden said it was the worst professional experience of my life the united states too has carried out cyberattacks and in decades past the c i a tried to subvert foreign elections but the russian attack is increasingly understood across the political spectrum as an ominous historic landmark with one notable exception mr trump has rejected the findings of the intelligence agencies he will soon oversee as ridiculous insisting that the hacker may be american or chinese but that they have no idea mr trump cited the reported disagreements between the agencies about whether mr putin intended to help elect him on tuesday a russian government spokesman echoed mr trump s scorn this tale of hacks resembles a banal brawl between american security officials over spheres of influence maria zakharova the spokeswoman for the russian foreign ministry wrote on facebook over the weekend four prominent senators two republicans and two democrats joined forces to pledge an investigation while pointedly ignoring mr trump s skeptical claims democrats and republicans must work together and across the jurisdictional lines of the congress to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks said senators john mccain lindsey graham chuck schumer and jack reed this cannot become a partisan issue they said the stakes are too high for our country sitting in the basement of the democratic national committee headquarters below a 2012 portrait of a smiling barack obama is a filing cabinet missing the handle on the bottom drawer only a framed newspaper story hanging on the wall hints at the importance of this aged piece of office furniture gop security aide among 5 arrested in bugging affair reads the headline from the front page of the washington post on june 19 1972 with the bylines of bob woodward and carl bernstein andrew brown 37 the technology director at the d n c was born after that famous but as he began to plan for this year s election cycle he was well aware that the d n c could become a target again there were aspirations to ensure that the d n c was well protected against cyberintruders and then there was the reality mr brown and his bosses at the organization acknowledged the d n c was a nonprofit group dependent on donations with a fraction of the security budget that a corporation its size would have there was never enough money to do everything we needed to do mr brown said the d n c had a standard email service intended to block phishing attacks and malware created to resemble legitimate email but when russian hackers started in on the d n c the committee did not have the most advanced systems in place to track suspicious traffic internal d n c memos show mr tamene who reports to mr brown and fielded the call from the f b i agent was not a d n c employee he works for a contracting firm called the mis department he was left to figure out largely on his own how to respond and even whether the man who had called in to the d n c switchboard was really an f b i agent the f b i thinks the d n c has at least one compromised computer on its network and the f b i wanted to know if the d n c is aware and if so what the d n c is doing about it mr tamene wrote in an internal memo about his contacts with the f b i he added that the special agent told me to look for a specific type of malware dubbed dukes by the u s intelligence community and in cybersecurity circles part of the problem was that special agent hawkins did not show up in person at the d n c nor could he email anyone there as that risked alerting the hackers that the f b i knew they were in the system mr tamene s initial scan of the d n c system using his tools and incomplete targeting information from the f b i found nothing so when special agent hawkins called repeatedly in october leaving voice mail messages for mr tamene urging him to call back i did not return his calls as i had nothing to report mr tamene explained in his memo in november special agent hawkins called with more ominous news a d n c computer was calling home where home meant russia mr tamene s memo says referring to software sending information to moscow sa hawkins added that the f b i thinks that this calling home behavior could be the result of a attack mr brown knew that mr tamene who declined to comment was fielding calls from the f b i but he was tied up on a different problem evidence suggesting that the campaign of senator bernie sanders of vermont mrs clinton s main democratic opponent had improperly gained access to her campaign data ms wasserman schultz then the d n c s chairwoman and amy dacey then its chief executive said in interviews that neither of them was notified about the early reports that the committee s system had likely been compromised shawn henry who once led the f b i s cyber division and is now president of crowdstrike services the cybersecurity firm retained by the d n c in april said he was baffled that the f b i did not call a more senior official at the d n c or send an agent in person to the party headquarters to try to force a more vigorous response we are not talking about an office that is in the middle of the woods of montana mr henry said we are talking about an office that is half a mile from the f b i office that is getting the notification this is not a delicatessen or a local library this is a critical piece of the u s infrastructure because it relates to our electoral process our elected officials our legislative process our executive process he added to me it is a serious issue and if after a couple of months you don t see any results somebody ought to raise that to a higher level the f b i declined to comment on the agency s handling of the hack the f b i takes very seriously any compromise of public and private sector systems it said in a statement adding that agents will continue to share information to help targets safeguard their systems against the actions of persistent cybercriminals by march mr tamene and his team had met at least twice in person with the f b i and concluded that agent hawkins was really a federal employee but then the situation took a dire turn a second team of hackers began to target the d n c and other players in the political world particularly democrats billy rinehart a former d n c regional field director who was then working for mrs clinton s campaign got an odd email warning from google someone just used your password to try to sign into your google account the march 22 email said adding that the attempt had occurred in ukraine google stopped this attempt you should change your password immediately mr rinehart was in hawaii at the time he remembers checking his email at 4 a m for messages from east coast associates without thinking much about the notification he clicked on the change password button and half asleep as best he can remember he typed in a new password what he did not know until months later is that he had just given the russian hackers access to his email account hundreds of similar phishing emails were being sent to american political targets including an identical email sent on march 19 to mr podesta chairman of the clinton campaign given how many emails mr podesta received through this personal email account several aides also had access to it and one of them noticed the warning email sending it to a computer technician to make sure it was legitimate before anyone clicked on the change password button this is a legitimate email charles delavan a clinton campaign aide replied to another of mr podesta s aides who had noticed the alert john needs to change his password immediately with another click a decade of emails that mr podesta maintained in his gmail account a total of about 60 000 were unlocked for the russian hackers mr delavan in an interview said that his bad advice was a result of a typo he knew this was a phishing attack as the campaign was getting dozens of them he said he had meant to type that it was an illegitimate email an error that he said has plagued him ever since during this second wave the hackers also gained access to the democratic congressional campaign committee and then through a virtual private network connection to the main computer network of the d n c the f b i observed this surge of activity as well again reaching out to mr tamene to warn him yet mr tamene still saw no reason to be alarmed he found copies of the phishing emails in the d n c s spam filter but he had no reason he said to believe that the computer systems had been infiltrated one bit of progress had finally been made by the middle of april the d n c seven months after it had first been warned finally installed a robust set of monitoring tools mr tamene s internal memo says the united states had two decades of warning that russia s intelligence agencies were trying to break into america s most sensitive computer networks but the russians have always managed to stay a step ahead their first major attack was detected on oct 7 1996 when a computer operator at the colorado school of mines discovered some nighttime computer activity he could not explain the school had a major contract with the navy and the operator warned his contacts there but as happened two decades later at the d n c at first everyone was unable to connect the dots said thomas rid a scholar at king s college in london who has studied the attack investigators gave it a name moonlight maze and spent two years often working day and night tracing how it hopped from the navy to the department of energy to the air force and nasa in the end they concluded that the total number of files stolen if printed and stacked would be taller than the washington monument whole weapons designs were flowing out the door and it was a first taste of what was to come an escalating campaign of cyberattacks around the world but for years the russians stayed largely out of the headlines thanks to the chinese who took bigger risks and often got caught they stole the designs for the fighter jet corporate secrets for rolling steel even the blueprints for gas pipelines that supply much of the united states and during the 2008 presidential election cycle chinese intelligence hacked into the campaigns of mr obama and mr mccain making off with internal position papers and communications but they didn t publish any of it the russians had not gone away of course they were just a lot more stealthy said kevin mandia a former air force intelligence officer who spent most of his days fighting off russian cyberattacks before founding mandiant a cybersecurity firm that is now a division of fireeye and the company the clinton campaign brought in to secure its own systems the russians were also quicker to turn their attacks to political purposes a 2007 cyberattack on estonia a former soviet republic that had joined nato sent a message that russia could paralyze the country without invading it the next year cyberattacks were used during russia s war with georgia but american officials did not imagine that the russians would dare try those techniques inside the united states they were largely focused on preventing what former defense secretary leon e panetta warned was an approaching cyber pearl harbor a shutdown of the power grid or cellphone networks but in 2014 and 2015 a russian hacking group began systematically targeting the state department the white house and the joint chiefs of staff each time they eventually met with some form of success michael sulmeyer a former cyberexpert for the secretary of defense and ben buchanan now both of the harvard cyber security project wrote recently in a published paper for the carnegie endowment the russians grew stealthier and stealthier tricking government computers into sending out data while disguising the electronic command and control messages that set off alarms for anyone looking for malicious actions the state department was so crippled that it repeatedly closed its systems to throw out the intruders at one point officials traveling to vienna with secretary of state john kerry for the iran nuclear negotiations had to set up commercial gmail accounts just to communicate with one another and with reporters traveling with them mr obama was briefed regularly on all this but he made a decision that many in the white house now regret he did not name russians publicly or issue sanctions there was always a reason fear of escalating a cyberwar and concern that the united states needed russia s cooperation in negotiations over syria we d have all these circular meetings one senior state department official said in which everyone agreed you had to push back at the russians and push back hard but it didn t happen so the russians escalated again breaking into systems not just for espionage but to publish or broadcast what they found known as doxing in the cyberworld it was a brazen change in tactics moving the russians from espionage to influence operations in february 2014 they broadcast an intercepted phone call between victoria nuland the assistant secretary of state who handles russian affairs and has a contentious relationship with mr putin and geoffrey pyatt the united states ambassador to ukraine ms nuland was heard describing a american effort to broker a deal in ukraine then in political turmoil they were not the only ones on whom the russians used the strategy the open society foundation run by george soros was a major target and when its documents were released some turned out to have been altered to make it appear as if the foundation was financing russian opposition members last year the attacks became more aggressive russia hacked a major french television station frying critical hardware around christmas it attacked part of the power grid in ukraine dropping a portion of the country into darkness killing backup generators and taking control of generators in retrospect it was a warning shot the attacks were not fully integrated military operations mr sulmeyer said but they showed an increasing boldness the day before the white house correspondents association dinner in april ms dacey the d n c s chief executive was preparing for a night of parties when she got an urgent phone call with the new monitoring system in place mr tamene had examined administrative logs of the d n c s computer system and found something very suspicious an unauthorized person with security status had gained access to the d n c s computers not sure it is related to what the f b i has been noticing said one internal d n c email sent on april 29 the d n c may have been hacked in a serious way this week with password theft etc no one knew just how bad the breach was but it was clear that a lot more than a single filing cabinet worth of materials might have been taken a secret committee was immediately created including ms dacey ms wasserman schultz mr brown and michael sussmann a former cybercrimes prosecutor at the department of justice who now works at perkins coie the washington law firm that handles d n c political matters three most important questions mr sussmann wrote to his clients the night the was confirmed 1 what data was accessed 2 how was it done 3 how do we stop it mr sussmann instructed his clients not to use d n c email because they had just one opportunity to lock the hackers out an effort that could be foiled if the hackers knew that the d n c was on to them you only get one chance to raise the drawbridge mr sussmann said if the adversaries know you are aware of their presence they will take steps to burrow in or erase the logs that show they were present the d n c immediately hired crowdstrike a cybersecurity firm to scan its computers identify the intruders and build a new computer and telephone system from scratch within a day crowdstrike confirmed that the intrusion had originated in russia mr sussmann said the work that such companies do is a computer version of crime scene investigation with fingerprints bullet casings and dna swabs replaced by an electronic trail that can be just as incriminating and just as police detectives learn to identify the telltale methods of a veteran burglar so crowdstrike investigators recognized the distinctive handiwork of cozy bear and fancy bear those are crowdstrike s nicknames for the two russian hacking groups that the firm found at work inside the d n c network cozy bear the group also known as the dukes or a p t 29 for advanced persistent threat may or may not be associated with the f s b the main successor to the k g b but it is widely believed to be a russian government operation it made its first appearance in 2014 said dmitri alperovitch crowdstrike s and chief technology officer it was cozy bear crowdstrike concluded that first penetrated the d n c in the summer of 2015 by sending emails to a long list of american government agencies washington nonprofits and government contractors whenever someone clicked on a phishing message the russians would enter the network exfiltrate documents of interest and stockpile them for intelligence purposes once they got into the d n c they found the data valuable and decided to continue the operation said mr alperovitch who was born in russia and moved to the united states as a teenager only in march 2016 did fancy bear show up first penetrating the computers of the democratic congressional campaign committee and then jumping to the d n c investigators believe fancy bear sometimes called a p t 28 and believed to be directed by the g r u russia s military intelligence agency is an older outfit tracked by western investigators for nearly a decade it was fancy bear that got hold of mr podesta s email attribution as the skill of identifying a cyberattacker is known is more art than science it is often impossible to name an attacker with absolute certainty but over time by accumulating a reference library of hacking techniques and targets it is possible to spot repeat offenders fancy bear for instance has gone after military and political targets in ukraine and georgia and at nato installations that largely rules out cybercriminals and most countries mr alperovitch said there s no plausible actor that has an interest in all those victims other than russia he said another clue the russian hacking groups tended to be active during working hours in the moscow time zone to their astonishment mr alperovitch said crowdstrike experts found signs that the two russian hacking groups had not coordinated their attacks fancy bear apparently not knowing that cozy bear had been rummaging in d n c files for months took many of the same documents in the six weeks after crowdstrike s arrival in total secrecy the computer system at the d n c was replaced for a weekend email and phones were shut off employees were told it was a system upgrade all laptops were turned in and the hard drives wiped clean with the uninfected information on them imaged to new drives though d n c officials had learned that the democratic congressional campaign committee had been infected too they did not notify their sister organization which was in the same building because they were afraid that it would leak all of this work took place as the bitter contest for the democratic nomination continued to play out between mrs clinton and mr sanders and it was already causing a major distraction for ms wasserman schultz and the d n c s chief executive this was not a bump in the road bumps in the road happen all the time she said in an interview two different russian spy agencies had hacked into our network and stolen our property and we did not yet know what they had taken but we knew they had very broad access to our network there was a tremendous amount of uncertainty and it was chilling the d n c executives and their lawyer had their first formal meeting with senior f b i officials in nine months after the bureau s first call to the contractor among the early requests at that meeting according to participants that the federal government make a quick attribution formally blaming actors with ties to russian government for the attack to make clear that it was not routine hacking but foreign espionage you have a presidential election underway here and you know that the russians have hacked into the d n c mr sussmann said recalling the message to the f b i we need to tell the american public that and soon in on mr sussmann s advice d n c leaders decided to take a bold step concerned that word of the hacking might leak they decided to go public in the washington post with the news that the committee had been attacked that way they figured they could get ahead of the story win a little sympathy from voters for being victimized by russian hackers and refocus on the campaign but the very next day a new deeply unsettling shock awaited them someone calling himself guccifer 2 0 appeared on the web claiming to be the d n c hacker and he posted a confidential committee document detailing mr trump s record and half a dozen other documents to prove his bona fides and it s just a tiny part of all docs i downloaded from the democrats networks he wrote then something more ominous the main part of the papers thousands of files and mails i gave to wikileaks they will publish them soon it was bad enough that russian hackers had been spying inside the committee s network for months now the public release of documents had turned a conventional espionage operation into something far more menacing political sabotage an unpredictable uncontrollable menace for democratic campaigns guccifer 2 0 borrowed the moniker of an earlier hacker a romanian who called himself guccifer and was jailed for breaking into the personal computers of former president george w bush former secretary of state colin l powell and other notables this new attacker seemed intent on showing that the d n c s cyberexperts at crowdstrike were wrong to blame russia guccifer 2 0 called himself a lone hacker and mocked crowdstrike for calling the attackers sophisticated but online investigators quickly undercut his story on a whim lorenzo a writer for motherboard the tech and culture site of vice tried to contact guccifer 2 0 by direct message on twitter surprisingly he answered right away mr said but whoever was on the other end seemed to be mocking him i asked him why he did it and he said he wanted to expose the illuminati he called himself a gucci lover and he said he was romanian that gave mr an idea using google translate he sent the purported hacker some questions in romanian the answers came back in romanian but when he was offline mr checked with a couple of native speakers who told him guccifer 2 0 had apparently been using google translate as well and was clearly not the romanian he claimed to be cyberresearchers found other clues pointing to russia microsoft word documents posted by guccifer 2 0 had been edited by someone calling himself in russian felix edmundovich an obvious nom de guerre honoring the founder of the soviet secret police felix edmundovich dzerzhinsky bad links in the texts were marked by warnings in russian generated by what was clearly a version of word when mr managed to engage guccifer 2 0 over a period of weeks he found that his interlocutor s tone and manner changed at first he was careless and colloquial weeks later he was curt and more calculating he said it seemed like a group of people and a very sloppy attempt to cover up computer experts drew the same conclusion about dcleaks com a site that sprang up in june claiming to be the work of hacktivists but posting more stolen documents it too seemed to be a clumsy front for the same russians who had stolen the documents notably the website was registered in april suggesting that the russian hacking team planned well in advance to make public what it stole in addition to what guccifer 2 0 published on his site he provided material directly on request to some bloggers and publications the steady flow of guccifer 2 0 documents constantly undercut democratic messaging efforts on july 6 12 days before the republican national convention began in cleveland guccifer released the d n c s battle plan and budget for countering it for republican operatives it was insider gold then wikileaks a far more established outlet began to publish the hacked material just as guccifer 2 0 had promised on july 22 three days before the start of the democratic national convention in philadelphia wikileaks dumped out 44 053 d n c emails with 17 761 attachments some of the messages made clear that some d n c officials favored mrs clinton over her progressive challenger mr sanders that was no shock mr sanders after all had been an independent socialist not a democrat during his long career in congress while mrs clinton had been one of the party s stars for decades but the emails some of them crude or insulting infuriated sanders delegates as they arrived in philadelphia ms wasserman schultz resigned under pressure on the eve of the convention where she had planned to preside mr trump by now the republican nominee expressed delight at the continuing jolts to his opponent and he began to use twitter and his stump speeches to highlight the wikileaks releases on july 25 he sent out a lighthearted tweet the new joke in town he wrote is that russia leaked the disastrous d n c which should never have been written stupid because putin likes me but wikileaks was far from finished on oct 7 a month before the election the site began the serial publication of thousands of private emails to and from mr podesta mrs clinton s campaign manager the same day the united states formally accused the russian government of being behind the hackings in a joint statement by the director of national intelligence and the department of homeland security and mr trump suffered his worst blow to date with the release of a recording in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women the podesta emails were nowhere near as sensational as the trump video but released by wikileaks day after day over the last month of the campaign they provided material for countless news reports they disclosed the contents of mrs clinton s speeches to large banks which she had refused to release they exposed tensions inside the campaign including disagreements over donations to the clinton foundation that staff members thought might look bad for the candidate and ms tanden s complaint that mrs clinton s instincts were suboptimal i was just mortified ms tanden said in an interview her emails were released on the eve of one of the presidential debates she recalled i put my hands over my head and said i can t believe this is happening to me though she had regularly appeared on television to support mrs clinton she canceled her appearances because all the questions were about what she had said in the emails ms tanden like other democrats whose messages became public said it was obvious to her that wikileaks was trying its best to damage the clinton campaign if you care about transparency you put all the emails out at once she said but they wanted to hurt her so they put them out 1 800 to 3 000 a day the trump campaign knew in advance about wikileaks plans days before the podesta email release began roger stone a republican operative working with the trump campaign sent out an excited tweet about what was coming but in an interview mr stone said he had no role in the leaks he had just heard from an american with ties to wikileaks that damning emails were coming julian assange the wikileaks founder and editor has resisted the conclusion that his site became a for russian hackers working for mr putin s government or that he was deliberately trying to undermine mrs clinton s candidacy but the evidence on both counts appears compelling in a series of email exchanges mr assange refused to say anything about wikileaks source for the hacked material he denied that he had made his animus toward mrs clinton clear in public statements false but what is this junior high or that the site had timed the releases for maximum negative effect on her campaign wikileaks makes its decisions based on newsworthiness including for its recent epic scoops he wrote mr assange disputed the conclusion of the oct 7 statement from the intelligence agencies that the leaks were intended to interfere with the u s election process this is false he wrote as the disclosing party we know that this was not the intent publishers publishing newsworthy information during an election is part of a free election but asked whether he believed the leaks were one reason for mr trump s election mr assange seemed happy to take credit americans extensively engaged with our publications he wrote according to facebook statistics wikileaks was the most referenced political topic during october though mr assange did not say so wikileaks best defense may be the conduct of the mainstream american media every major publication including the times published multiple stories citing the d n c and podesta emails posted by wikileaks becoming a de facto instrument of russian intelligence mr putin a student of martial arts had turned two institutions at the core of american democracy political campaigns and independent media to his own ends the media s appetite for the hacked material and its focus on the gossipy content instead of the russian source disturbed some of those whose personal emails were being reposted across the web what was really surprising to me ms tanden said i could not believe that reporters were covering it inside the white house as mr obama s advisers debated their response their conversation turned to north korea in late 2014 hackers working for kim the north s young and unpredictable leader had carried out a attack on sony pictures entertainment intended to stop the christmastime release of a comedy about a c i a plot to kill mr kim in that case embarrassing emails had also been released but the real damage was done to sony s own systems more than 70 percent of its computers melted down when a particularly virulent form of malware was released within weeks intelligence agencies traced the attack back to the north and its leadership mr obama called north korea out in public and issued some sanctions the chinese even cooperated briefly cutting off the north s internet connections as the first situation room meetings on the russian hacking began in july it was clear that russia was going to be a much more complicated case said one participant the russians clearly had a more sophisticated understanding of american politics and they were masters of kompromat their term for compromising information but a formal attribution report still had not been forwarded to the president it took forever one senior administration official said complaining about the pace at which the intelligence assessments moved through the system in august a group that called itself the shadow brokers published a set of software tools that looked like what the n s a uses to break into foreign computer networks and install implants malware that can be used for surveillance or attack the code came from the tailored access operations unit of the n s a a secretive group that mastered the arts of surveillance and cyberwar the assumption still unproved was that the code was put out in the open by the russians as a warning retaliate for the d n c and there are a lot more secrets from the hackings of the state department the white house and the pentagon that might be spilled as well one senior official compared it to the scene in the godfather where the head of a favorite horse is left in a bed as a warning the n s a said nothing but by late august admiral rogers its director was pressing for a more muscular response to the russians in his role as director of the pentagon s cyber command he proposed a series of potential while officials will not discuss them in detail the possible counterstrikes reportedly included operations that would turn the tables on mr putin exposing his financial links to russia s oligarchs and punching holes in the russian internet to allow dissidents to get their message out pentagon officials judged the measures too unsubtle and ordered up their own set of options but in the end none of those were formally presented to the president in a series of deputies meetings run by avril haines the deputy national security adviser and a former deputy director of the c i a several officials warned that an overreaction by the administration would play into mr putin s hands if we went to defcon 4 one frequent participant in ms haines s meetings said using a phrase from the cold war days of warnings of war we would be saying to the public that we didn t have confidence in the integrity of our voting system even something seemingly straightforward using the president s executive powers bolstered after the sony incident to place economic and travel sanctions on cyberattackers seemed too risky no one was all that eager to impose costs before election day said another participant in the classified meeting any retaliatory measures were seen through the prism of what would happen on election day instead when mr obama s national security team reconvened after summer vacation the focus turned to a crash effort to secure the nation s voting machines and rolls from hacking the scenario they discussed most frequently one that turned out not to be an issue was a narrow vote in favor of mrs clinton followed by a declaration by mr trump that the vote was rigged and more leaks intended to undercut her legitimacy donna brazile the interim chairwoman of the d n c became increasingly frustrated as the clock continued to run down on the presidential election and still there was no broad public condemnation by the white house or republican party leaders of the attack as an act of foreign espionage ms brazile even reached out to reince priebus the chairman of the republican national committee urging him twice in private conversations and in a letter to join her in condemning the attacks an offer he declined to take up we just kept hearing the government would respond the government would respond she said once upon a time if a foreign government interfered with our election we would respond as a nation not as a political party but mr obama did decide that he would deliver a warning to mr putin in person at a group of 20 summit meeting in hangzhou china the last time they would be in the same place while mr obama was still in office when the two men met for a tense mr obama explicitly warned mr putin of a strong american response if there was continued effort to influence the election or manipulate the vote according to white house officials who were not present for the meeting later that day mr obama made a rare reference to america s own offensive cybercapacity which he has almost never talked about frankly both offensively and defensively we have more capacity he told reporters but when it came time to make a public assertion of russia s role in early october it was made in a written statement from the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security it was far less dramatic than the president s appearance in the press room two years before to directly accuse the north koreans of attacking sony the reference in the statement to hackings on political organizations officials now say encompassed a hacking on data stored by the republicans as well two senior officials say the forensic evidence was accompanied by human and technical sources in russia which appears to mean that the united states implants or taps in russian computer and phone networks helped confirm the country s role but that may not be known for decades until the secrets are declassified a week later vice president joseph r biden jr was sent out to transmit a public warning to mr putin the united states will retaliate at the time of our choosing and under the circumstances that have the greatest impact later after mr biden said he was not concerned that russia could fundamentally alter the election he was asked whether the american public would know if the message to mr putin had been sent hope not mr biden responded some of his former colleagues think that was the wrong answer an american counterstrike said michael morell the former deputy director of the c i a under mr obama has got to be overt it needs to be seen a covert response would significantly limit the deterrence effect he added if you can t see it it s not going to deter the chinese and north koreans and iranians and others the obama administration says it still has more than 30 days to do exactly that as the year draws to a close it now seems possible that there will be multiple investigations of the russian hacking the intelligence review mr obama has ordered completed by jan 20 the day he leaves office and one or more congressional inquiries they will wrestle with among other things mr putin s motive did he seek to mar the brand of american democracy to forestall activism for both russians and their neighbors or to weaken the next american president since presumably mr putin had no reason to doubt american forecasts that mrs clinton would win easily or was it as the c i a concluded last month a deliberate attempt to elect mr trump in fact the russian scheme accomplished all three goals what seems clear is that russian hacking given its success is not going to stop two weeks ago the german intelligence chief bruno kahl warned that russia might target elections in germany next year the perpetrators have an interest to delegitimize the democratic process as such mr kahl said now he added europe is in the focus of these attempts of disturbance and germany to a particularly great extent but russia has by no means forgotten its american target on the day after the presidential election the cybersecurity company volexity reported five new waves of phishing emails evidently from cozy bear aimed at think tanks and nonprofits in the united states one of them purported to be from harvard university attaching a fake paper its title why american elections are flawed ',\n",
       " 'when the united nations top official tried to inspect an infamous prison in gambia two years ago officials there denied him access so he protested all the way up the country s chain of command in a tense meeting with members of the cabinet of the country s autocratic ruler the united nations official juan e méndez was again denied this time with a jeering dismissal they said why don t you go to guantánamo instead recalled mr mendez a former united nations special rapporteur on torture in bahrain officials were a little more subtle but the message was the same as they twice canceled prison inspection visits they said we face the same threats to national security as other countries face mr mendez said it was clear they were referring to the united states and they didn t feel that they needed to give me access now after donald j trump s campaign vows to reinstate the sort of torture used in the war on terrorism and to fill the guantánamo bay prison with some bad dudes human rights experts fear that authoritarian regimes around the world will see it as another green light to carry out their own abuses a return to such enhanced interrogation and even to techniques that mr trump has pledged will be much worse would also send a powerful message just as nations around the world have begun to examine their own past abuses to ensure that they will not be repeated sometimes we see progress and then we see said victor the of the international rehabilitation council for torture victims a umbrella organization for groups when the u s was engaging in torture that created an enormous of the pendulum he added there were a lot of officials in other countries during the bush administration who were saying the americans are doing it so why can t we now with trump saying i will bring a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding you can imagine how far we could go backwards nils melzer who succeeded mr mendez as the united nations special rapporteur on torture in november warned that if the trump administration revived the use of torture the consequences around the world would be catastrophic a fragile consensus against torture said josé miguel vivanco the regional director for the americas for human rights watch could be shattered when you have the white house openly advocating for torture during the campaign mr trump declared that torture works and he vowed to immediately reinstate techniques like waterboarding because we have to beat the savages of the islamic state who deserve such treatment even if it is fruitless since the election mr trump has indicated that he might be reconsidering his position citing the firm stance against torture by james n mattis his pentagon nominee in an interview with the new york times in november mr trump said that he was surprised when mr mattis told him that he opposed torture and instead favored more humane interrogations of prisoners based on rapport building but mr trump did not close the door entirely if americans feel strongly about bringing back waterboarding and other tactics he said i would be guided by that nora sveaass a psychologist at the university of oslo and a former member of the united nations committee against torture warned that if mr trump revived the use of torture by the united states it would have a ripple effect around the globe the u s is a very strong voice ms sveaass said it s just like putting a bomb into all of those major principles the absolute prohibition on torture the absolute obligation to provide redress and justice to victims of torture including rehabilitation the obligation to investigate and hold people to account she added if one country such as the u s openly torpedoes those principles you can just forget about asking for compliance from states already challenging the absolute prohibition the signal from mr trump that torture is acceptable again comes just as countries from argentina to tunisia either through courts or special truth commissions are engaged in tentative efforts to hold themselves accountable for past conduct in argentina omar graffigna the former chief of the country s air force was sentenced to prison in september for the 1978 kidnapping and torture of two activists patricia roisinblit and josé manuel pérez rojo the prosecution of mr graffigna was just one in a series of old cases that have been brought into the courts this year in argentina as the nation comes to grips with the legacy of its dirty war of the 1970s and early 1980s in tunisia a new truth and dignity commission held its first hearings in november allowing torture victims to tell their harrowing stories before a national television audience the commission was created to investigate torture and other human rights violations dating to 1955 primarily by the regime of president zine ben ali who was deposed during the arab spring in 2011 and in december bolivia s legislature voted to create a truth commission to investigate torture murders and other crimes committed by a series of authoritarian regimes from 1964 to 1982 even in countries that have not conducted such investigations new organizations have begun to take root and those groups are trying to make it more difficult for their governments to continue to engage in torture with secrecy and impunity samuel herbert nsubuga the chief executive of the african center for treatment and rehabilitation of torture victims based in uganda said legislation that the country passed in 2012 had still not been put into effect when the law finally takes effect our challenge will be to bring some people to trial in uganda for torture he said in the meantime his group has enlisted doctors and psychologists to provide medical help and therapy to torture victims as well as lawyers to provide legal advice but the moves toward examining past abuses are so far limited to relatively small nations or countries where the focus is on historical events rather than the current use of torture the inquiries are also often being conducted in the face of strong resistance from top government officials who oppose aggressive investigations even of past crimes those modest efforts could face sharp setbacks if mr trump brings back banned practices i am afraid that trump s government will question the basic values of the international order and torturing people will be justified said carlos jibaja a psychologist with caps a group in lima peru that helps victims of torture at the same time mr trump s advocacy of torture may encourage some major countries like russia and the philippines to be even more open and aggressive in their use of torture olga sadovskaya the vice chairwoman of the committee against torture a human rights group in russia said that torture was already common in the country she noted that russian prison and police officials routinely used torture tactics with cruel nicknames such as the president putin which involves attaching wires from an office telephone to a victim s body and then running electric current through it the police like that tactic she said because it does not leave marks edeliza hernandez the executive director of the medical action group in the philippines an organization that documents cases of torture and provides treatment and rehabilitation estimated that there were 200 political prisoners in detention centers in the country and said that most of them had been tortured the government has soldiers watch us while we inspect prisoners she said mr melzer the united nations official warned that if mr trump followed through on his pledges more countries would follow his lead and get back into the torture business what kind of message would that be to the world mr melzer asked it couldn t be worse what happens to the role of the united states as an example in the world and what would that mean for the policies of other states if the united states does it those other countries will know they can get away with it the last thing the world needs is a u s president legitimizing this ',\n",
       " 'washington vice mike pence and the top republicans in congress made clear on wednesday more powerfully and explicitly than ever that they are dead serious about repealing the affordable care act how they can uproot a law deeply embedded in the nation s health care system without hurting some of the 20 million people who have gained coverage through it is not clear nor is it yet evident that millions of americans with medical conditions will be fully protected against disruptions in their health coverage but a determined republican president and congress can gut the affordable care act and do it quickly a health care revolution in reverse that would undo many of the changes made since the law was signed by president obama in march 2010 the senate intends to pass a budget resolution next week that would shield repeal legislation from a democratic filibuster if the senate completes its action house republican leaders hope that they too can approve a version of the budget resolution next week whether they can meet that goal is unclear the resolution contains seemingly innocuous language instructing four committees that control health care policy two in the senate two in the house to draft legislation within their jurisdiction that would cut at least 1 billion from the deficit over 10 years but that language has real teeth the legislation produced to meet those instructions can pass the senate with a simple majority 51 votes if all senators are present obliterating the power of the democratic minority to block it those four committees would have just a few weeks until jan 27 to produce legislation repealing major provisions of the affordable care act house republicans have some practice at this because they have voted more than 60 times since 2011 to repeal some or all of the law the budget blueprint will guide congress but will not be presented to the president for a signature or veto the committees house energy and commerce house ways and means senate finance and senate health education labor and pensions will quickly assemble legislation intended to eviscerate the health care law the repeal legislation will be in the form of a reconciliation bill authorized by the congressional budget act of 1974 such bills can be adopted under special procedures but senate rules generally bar the use of those procedures for measures that have no effect on spending or revenue so the legislation as now conceived would probably leave the most popular provisions of the health law intact such as the prohibition on insurers denying coverage to people with conditions instead the legislation would eliminate the tax penalties imposed on people who go without insurance and on larger employers who do not offer coverage to employees eliminate tens of billions of dollars provided each year to states that have expanded eligibility for medicaid repeal subsidies for private health insurance coverage obtained through the public marketplaces known as exchanges it could also repeal some of the taxes and fees that help pay for the expansion of coverage under the affordable care act but some republicans have indicated that they may want to use some of that revenue for their plan to replace the health care law the 2010 law imposed taxes and fees on certain people and on health insurers and manufacturers of prescription drugs and medical devices among others republicans have not said for sure which taxes they will scrap and which they may keep republicans say they will delay the effective date of their repeal bill to avoid disrupting coverage and to provide time for them to develop alternatives to mr obama s law they disagree over how long the delay should last with two to four years being mentioned as possibilities within days of taking office donald j trump plans to announce executive actions on health care some may undo obama administration policies others will be meant to stabilize health insurance markets and prevent them from collapsing in a vast sea of uncertainty we are working on a series of executive orders that the will put into effect to ensure that there is an orderly transition during the period after we repeal obamacare to a health care economy mr pence said at the capitol on wednesday he did not provide details and trump transition aides said they had no information about the executive orders but some options are apparent the federal government could continue providing financial assistance to insurance companies to protect them against financial losses and to prevent consumers premiums from soaring more than they have in the last few years even as they move full speed toward gutting the existing health law republicans are scrambling to find a replacement at the moment they have no consensus mr pence said on wednesday that the replacement would probably encourage greater use of personal health savings accounts and make it easier for carriers to sell insurance across state lines also he said it would encourage small businesses to band together and buy insurance through association health plans sponsored by business and professional organizations some type of subsidy or tax credit for consumers to help defray the cost of premiums is also likely states would have more authority to set insurance standards and the federal government would have less mr trump has also endorsed the idea of pools for people with conditions who would otherwise have difficulty finding affordable coverage many experts have said that repealing the health law without a clear plan to replace it could create havoc in insurance markets doctors hospitals and insurance companies do not know what to expect without an effective requirement for people to carry insurance and without subsidies to buy it supporters of the law say many healthy people would go without coverage knowing they could obtain it if they became ill and needed it democrats in congress say they will do everything they can to thwart republican efforts to dismantle the affordable care act they plan to dramatize their case by publicizing the experiences of people whose lives have been saved or improved by the law in the senate next week democrats will demand votes intended to put republicans on record against proposals that could protect consumers defenders of the law also hope to mobilize groups like the american cancer society and the american heart association to speak up for patients the senate democratic leader chuck schumer of new york and the house democratic leader nancy pelosi of california are encouraging their colleagues to organize rallies around the country on jan 15 to oppose the republicans health care agenda and to buttress their case democrats are compiling statistics from the white house and from researchers at groups like the center on budget and policy priorities the commonwealth fund and the urban institute which warn of catastrophic consequences if the law is repealed ',\n",

american diplomats familiar with the plan breaking with decades of precedent by declining to provide even the briefest of grace periods the mandate issued without exceptions according to a terse state department cable sent on dec 23 diplomats who saw it said threatens to leave the united states without envoys for months in critical nations like germany canada and britain in the past administrations of both parties have often granted extensions on a basis to allow a handful of ambassadors particularly those with children to remain in place for weeks or months mr trump by contrast has taken a hard line against leaving any of president obama s political appointees in place as he prepares to take office on jan 20 with a mission of dismantling many of his predecessor s signature foreign and domestic policy achievements political ambassadors many of them major donors who are nominated by virtue of close ties with the president almost always leave at the end of his term ambassadors who are career diplomats often remain in their posts a senior trump transition official said there was no ill will in the move describing it as a simple matter of ensuring that mr obama s overseas appointees leave the government on schedule just as thousands of political aides at the white house and in federal agencies must do the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal deliberations said the ambassadors should not be surprised about being held to a hard end date the directive has nonetheless upended the personal lives of many ambassadors who are scrambling to secure living arrangements and acquire visas allowing them to remain in their countries so their children can remain in school the diplomats said they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly on the matter in costa rica ambassador stafford fitzgerald haney is hunting for a house or an apartment as his family which includes four children and his wife who has been battling breast cancer struggles to figure out how to avoid a move back to the united states with five months left in the school year according to the diplomats in the czech republic they said ambassador andrew h schapiro is seeking housing in prague as well as lobbying his children s school to break with policy and accept them back midyear in brussels and geneva denise bauer the united states ambassador to belgium and pamela hamamoto the permanent representative to the united nations are both trying to find a way to keep daughters from having to move just months before their high school graduation ronald e neumann the president of the american academy of diplomacy a nonprofit association for former ambassadors and senior diplomats said it was reasonable to expect ambassadors to return at the end of a term given that they are direct representatives of the president with broad grants of authority but he could not recall an occasion on which such a strict timeline had been applied when you have people out there whose only reason for being an ambassador is their political connection to the outgoing president of a different party it s pretty logical to say they should leave said mr neumann a career foreign service officer who held ambassadorships in algeria bahrain and afghanistan but i don t recollect there was ever a guillotine in january where it was just everybody out of the pool immediately w robert pearson a former ambassador to turkey and a scholar at the middle east institute in washington said the rule was quite extraordinary adding that it could undermine american interests and signal a hasty change in direction that exacerbates jitters among allies about their relationships with the new administration with the world already primed to be worrying about such an abrupt change this is just a very concrete signal that it is going to happen mr pearson said at a white house farewell reception that mr obama held on wednesday night for noncareer ambassadors many of them commiserated attendees said comparing notes about how to handle the situation some expressed dismay that mr trump whose wife melania has chosen to stay in new york to avoid moving the couple s son barron to a new school midyear would not ensure that such allowances were made for american ambassadors they are weighing a direct appeal to rex w tillerson mr trump s nominee for secretary of state or other top transition officials to reconsider the policy derek shearer a professor of diplomacy at occidental college who is a former united states ambassador to finland said it was difficult to see a rationale for the decision it feels like there s an element just of spite and payback in it he said i don t see a higher policy motive the state department informed all politically appointed ambassadors in a letter the day after the election that they were to submit letters of resignation effective jan 20 it instructed those who wanted to seek extensions to submit formal requests explaining their justifications incoming presidents of both parties have often made exceptions to allow ambassadors to wrap up personal affairs and important diplomatic business while their successors were in the confirmation process which can take months bill clinton george w bush and mr obama all granted extensions for a few politically appointed ambassadors former secretary of state colin l powell offered particularly wide latitude to ambassadors facing family issues said marc grossman a longtime diplomat and former top state department official who is vice chairman of the cohen group a washington consultancy this was something that was important to secretary powell because of his own experience living and serving all over the world so when people asked him could i stay another couple of weeks couple of months my kids are finishing school he was very accommodating mr grossman said adding that his flexibility was an exception to the general practice he was trying to i think send a message that family was important ',\n",

       " 'talladega ala for a band at a tiny historically black college it seems in some ways to be the gig of a lifetime a chance to march and perform at the jan 20 presidential inaugural parade in washington some of the musicians at talladega college have been excited to see the capital for the first time but because the is donald j trump the school has become the subject of an impassioned national outcry with online petitions threats to end donations and a flurry of from alumni who feel that performing in the parade would betray the values of an institution founded by newly freed slaves 150 years ago on thursday after days of speculation that the college administration might bow to the pressure and remove the band from the parade roster the president of talladega college billy hawkins issued a statement confirming the participation of the band the marching tornadoes and argued in essence that the 58th presidential inauguration is about something bigger than mr trump we respect and appreciate how our students and alumni feel about our participation in this parade dr hawkins said as many of those who chose to participate in the parade have said we feel the inauguration of a new president is not a political event but a civil ceremony celebrating the transfer of power similar issues have been raised about other entertainers scheduled to perform among them the radio city rockettes and the mormon tabernacle choir but because of talladega s history the issues have been especially intense here with calls for the college to reverse its decision to take part in the festivities and beyond talladega the controversies raise tough questions for mr trump s most ardent critics as his presidency dawns what is the proper response to a president as polarizing as mr trump should the office of the president be honored no matter who fills it or should there be four years of pure rejection and defiance and if mr trump s opponents refuse to participate in his presidency can critics on the right do the same thing to some other in the future to a number of talladega alumni the dec 30 announcement that the band would march in the parade was an insult to the very principles of the college which was established two years after the end of the civil war the school is affiliated with the united church of christ a liberal protestant denomination that was deeply involved in the civil rights movement and for decades it served as an incubator for theories and practices of social justice nikky finney a poet and talladega graduate who is now a professor at the university of south carolina said in a statement this week that the band should not help celebrate mr trump who she said has maligned women and mexican immigrants and has proposed barring all muslims from entering the country in an interview on thursday ms finney channeling a james brown lyric said the college had sold out the history of talladega college for chicken change and maybe a tin star on a hatemonger s parade route as of thursday afternoon an online petition calling for the band to withdraw from the inaugural parade had attracted more than 1 900 signers some of them supporters of the college who have threatened to withhold future contributions but a second petition which had nearly 300 supporters argued that the parade was not about politics but about seeing firsthand the process of a transition and giving the students a chance to be a part of history we are not thinkers and believe everyone is entitled to their own beliefs it stated however we are in support of the united states of america as the debate heated up this week in online forums for students and alumni the leadership at the private college hunkered down to consider how best to proceed the campus police ordered reporters off the campus brief interviews with a few band members on tuesday evening revealed a group divided jerome haynes 18 a freshman who plays the snare drum said he hoped politics would not get in the way of an exciting opportunity for the band in contrast ronald peterson 21 a sophomore who plays cymbals said he was going to talk to the director about staying home i feel that those who are not republicans should not have to play for it he said on thursday afternoon some students said the administration had done the right thing despite the protests from alumni antonio phillips 24 a senior and a drum major welcomed the exposure we re musicians so this is a good platform for us to showcase our talent in front of the world he said his friend ken randolph 20 a junior who is not in the band said the concerns of alumni like ms finney weigh heavily on the students of talladega but he said mr trump might benefit from the exposure to a black art form this is a part of our culture mr randolph said with it being on his front doorstep he might be able to apprehend the vibe and the culture that drama in talladega a city of 15 000 about an hour s drive east of birmingham played out as black activists including the n a a c p president cornell william brooks were arrested on tuesday in mobile in a action at the office of senator jeff sessions the alabama republican nominated to be attorney general in the trump administration mr sessions who is white was rejected by the senate for a federal judgeship in 1986 after he was accused of making racially insensitive statements to some talladega alumni the possibility that policies long opposed by could now be enacted by a congress and executive branch was what made the notion of a black band marching for mr trump seem so distasteful there s a great deal of fear in this country that the voting rights act is going to be abolished that the affordable care act is going to be abolished that planned parenthood is going to be cut off from funding that medicaid is going be cut off from funding said j mason davis a birmingham lawyer who graduated from the college in 1956 don t you understand why we have a fear of the man donavon jackson 24 a former trumpet player in the band who graduated last year said performing as part of the inauguration would be particularly special for a college of about 1 000 students whose band program is only about five years old the school does not have a football team which makes parade invitations all the more important i m honored to go to a school that can say they marched in an inauguration parade said mr jackson who received a chemistry degree and now lives in houston not necessarily for the person and that s not necessarily saying he s a bad person in the statement on thursday school officials said they still faced the challenge of raising more than 60 000 to cover expenses for the trip the population of the city of talladega is divided about evenly between blacks and whites and to a visitor it can feel like a place where racial harmony and discord coexist on seemingly parallel planes whites speak with pride about the historic black college downtown though one white person was overheard on wednesday warning of a liberal plot to foment a race war so that president obama might declare martial law before the inauguration while some residents said the band should stay home and others said it should attend the event in washington a few spoke harshly of mr trump while hoping the inauguration would help the band get noticed something the city which was bypassed by the interstate highway system has struggled with in recent decades bonquita mcclellan 26 manages her father s restaurant big mac s open pit bbq near campus ms mcclellan who is black said the disdain for mr trump among her peers was universal if anybody would have had us in concentration camps she said it d be him but she also said the band should go and make a name for itself in the nation s capital how often she asked does talladega college get a chance to play for the president up the street at a real estate office near the courthouse randy and heather roberts a white couple who voted for mr trump raved about the talladega college band and its performance at the dec 5 christmas parade ms roberts showed a video of the band on her phone they were phenomenal ms roberts said ms roberts 41 said she grew up with black and white friends mr roberts 48 said he and his wife were pleased to cater to their multiracial clientele but when they spoke about politics the couple sounded like people who knew something was broken but did not know how it might be fixed it is not going to be pleasant for the next four years ms roberts said it is going to

       " 'after more than five years of investigations and negotiations the curious case of mf global is finally closed on thursday federal regulators announced a 5 million settlement with jon s corzine who ran mf global when it collapsed into bankruptcy in 2011 and lost more than 1 billion in customer money the settlement reached unanimously at the commodity futures trading commission in the waning days of the obama administration and approved by a federal judge this week caps a spectacle that derailed mr corzine s career and spurred a number of congressional criminal and regulatory investigations the regulatory case arose in 2013 when the commodities agency sued mr corzine a democratic former new jersey senator and governor saying he had failed to diligently supervise the firm as it jeopardized the clients accounts the agency did not directly link mr corzine 70 to the missing money but it did accuse a employee in chicago edith o brien of aiding and abetting the misuse of customer money saying she allowed it to be used to plug holes in mf global s own accounts to resolve the case mr corzine has agreed to pay the 5 million penalty out of his own pocket while the sum is manageable for someone who reaped many millions of dollars as a top goldman sachs executive before pursuing a career in politics it is an unusual step in other federal cases involving wall street insurance money often covers settlement amounts sparing the executives themselves while mr corzine was willing to settle the case ms o brien nearly took it to trial but in recent weeks she too agreed to settle striking a deal that has imposed a 500 000 penalty and an prohibition on her associating with a futures broker like mf global mr corzine agreed to a harsher undertaking accepting a lifetime prohibition from leading a futures broker or registering with the commodity futures trading commission in effect that means he will not personally trade other people s money in the futures industry except for smaller trades under certain threshold limits mr corzine in theory could still operate a hedge fund that does futures trading and he could trade for his own account the settlement also does not prevent him from trading in other markets this resolution demonstrates the importance that the commission attaches to customer protection which has long been a hallmark of our mission aitan goelman the head of the commodity futures trading commission enforcement division said in a statement announcing the settlement the settlements the contours of which were reported by the new york times in october bring a close to the mf global ordeal the criminal investigations ended with the conclusion that mf global employees did not intentionally break the law just last year mr corzine settled much of the private mf global litigation and a trustee has long recovered the missing customer money much of it wound up at mf global s banks and clearinghouses and made whole the farmers and hedge funds whose accounts were raided in the firm s final days in a statement on thursday mr corzine said as the c e o of mf global in 2011 i have accepted responsibility for its failure and i deeply regret the impact it had on customers employees shareholders and others he added i remain gratified that several years ago all customer money was recovered and returned to mf global customers his lawyer andrew j levander said mr corzine has given more than 10 days of testimony under oath and these matters have been investigated exhaustively by two u s attorney s offices the f b i the s e c the c f t c finra and congress finra is the financial industry regulatory authority and yet mr levander said none of these investigations have led to allegations that mr corzine engaged in any kind of intentional misconduct or fraud or that he was at any time not truthful in his many hours of testimony the case also concludes a political challenge for the commodities agency which came under fire for not preventing a breach of customer money at a firm it regulated compounding the pressure mr corzine was a sensitive target a prominent democrat who has been a confidant of leaders in washington and on wall street against that backdrop the agency extracted the 5 million payout from mr corzine a sum far greater than what it could have expected to win if he had been found liable at trial during negotiations with mr corzine last year the commission also strengthened aspects of the deal after some of the agency s commissioners questioned it the new york times reported at the time the case against mr corzine was among the agency s biggest enforcement actions in the obama administration and after mf global s demise on halloween in 2011 the commodities agency used the episode to tighten the rules for protecting customer money the disappearance of the money from mf global unnerved the futures industry and raised broader concerns about the safety of customer funds across wall street further review showed that mf global s financial straits left it vulnerable to a breach mr corzine joined mf global as chief executive and chairman in 2010 after the firm had lost money in each of the previous three years in hopes of returning the firm to profitability and perhaps transforming it into a miniature goldman sachs mr corzine placed a large wager on european sovereign debt at a time when investors feared defaults in the eurozone although his bet ultimately would have been profitable for mf global and the european bonds paid out for other firms that bought the debt it was not enough to save the firm from unrelated woes mf global s auditor for example made the firm write down the value of a significant future tax benefit a move that appeared to unnerve mf global s investors as well as ratings agencies and after a series of ratings downgrades the firm started to unravel in mf global s final days it overdrew an account at jpmorgan chase one of its banks and scrambled to patch that hole that is when the improper transfers of customer money accelerated according to the commodity futures trading commission s complaint minutes after learning of the overdrawn account mr corzine told ms o brien that meeting the bank s demands was the most important thing she could get done that day ultimately in the chaos and confusion of those final days customer money was transferred to jpmorgan and yet mr corzine was not accused of instructing ms o brien to use customer money for this purpose according to court records submitted by his lawyers mr corzine was not told that the firm was at risk of violating the rules until the eve of the bankruptcy after the breach had happened in an email ms o brien told mr corzine that the transfer to jpmorgan was a house wire meaning it came from the firm s accounts in the years since mr corzine has visited central america for a humanitarian project and has traded with his own money his philanthropic efforts have included working with covenant house a nonprofit focused on helping homeless children with this matter resolved he said i am eager to move forward and plan to spend my time focused on issues that have always been important in my life my family community and philanthropic causes and markets ',\n",

       " 'detroit unexpectedly strong sales of new vehicles in the united states in december propelled the industry to another record figure in 2016 17 55 million sold that is the good news the bad news though is that the late push to beat the previous record 17 47 million vehicles sold in 2015 came at a steep cost as companies piled on higher sales incentives to lure consumers to their showrooms and with the american market tilting more than ever toward sales of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles companies are cutting production of passenger cars to reduce big inventories of models as a result there is little expectation that the sales will continue on this upward trajectory at least not without cutting deep into profits that means the numbers released wednesday could be the mark for the industry s impressive comeback from the depths of the recession when annual sales fell below 11 million vehicles and general motors and chrysler needed government bailouts to survive adding to the challenge is the potential for major changes in federal regulatory and trade policies by the trump administration setting up an uncertain year for an industry that has been barreling along one of the problems with predicting 2017 is it is the year of unknowns said michelle krebs an analyst with the site autotrader we are hearing a lot of different things about border tariffs and regulatory policies but we don t know what the whole picture looks like most major automakers are making big profits these days as consumers replace aging cars and trucks with new models loaded with technology that last year sold for an average sticker price above 35 000 yet companies face a new set of challenges posed by slower growth and industry executives are bracing for potential tariffs on vehicles imported into the united states from mexico or other adjustments in trade policies that could upset the global pipeline of parts to vehicle assembly plants the uncertainty extends to the market itself which has steadily grown year after year as consumers took advantage of easy credit and better economic conditions to replace aging vehicles demand however has leveled off and companies are falling back on old habits to move excess inventories analysts reported that sales incentives were about 25 percent higher in the fourth quarter of 2016 than in the same period a year earlier even though overall sales were flat that is partly because of a sustained slump in sales of small and midsize cars which has offset the increased demand for trucks and s u v s but it forces automakers to rely on discounts to sell less popular models adjust production plans on the fly and lay off workers at some of their factories general motors the nation s largest automaker has announced plans to cut shifts of workers at three assembly plants that build cars in michigan and ohio and analysts expect more adjustments across the industry as companies try to better match supply with demand we do expect production will likely be cut particularly in the compact and midsize segments said alec gutierrez an analyst with the research firm kelley blue book the industry sold 1 69 million vehicles during the month of december an increase of about 3 percent from the same period a year earlier according to the research firm autodata the 17 55 million sold over the year was a gain of 0 4 percent sales of trucks and s u v s accounted for nearly of the sales volume during december as consumers continue to turn to the larger vehicles over cars analysts expect the trend toward larger vehicles to continue as long as gas prices remain low over all the industry forecasts sales exceeding 17 million vehicles in the united states in the coming year although how automakers manage shifts in demand will affect their profitability the most successful automakers in the long term will be able to prioritize profitability over market share and be willing to pull back artificial support for unprofitable volume said stephanie brinkley an analyst at the firm ihs markit g m said its sales in december increased 10 percent to 319 000 vehicles although its annual sales for all of 2016 fell 1 3 percent to 3 04 million vehicles the company benefited from strong demand for pickups and its biggest s u v s such as the chevrolet tahoe whose sales rose nearly 17 percent last year but g m exemplified the market s split personality as several of its smaller cars experienced sharp declines g m is expanding its s u v lineup and will unveil new models at the coming detroit auto show

mohatarem g m s chief economist ford motor the american automaker said it sold 237 000 vehicles in december a slight gain from the same month in 2015 for the year ford reported sales of 2 61 million vehicles in the united states essentially the same total as in 2015 the company s cornerstone product the pickup was once again the vehicle in the american market with 820 000 trucks sold last year

       " 'everyone has theories for why professionals are moving back into parts of cities shunned by their parents generation perhaps their living preferences have shifted or the demands of the labor market have and young adults with less leisure time are loath to waste it commuting maybe the tendency to postpone marriage and children has made city living more alluring or the benefits of cities themselves have improved there are all sorts of potential other amenities whether it s cafes restaurants bars nicer parks better schools said ingrid gould ellen a professor of urban policy and planning at new york university but a huge piece of it she said i think is crime new research that she has conducted alongside keren mertens horn an economist at the university of massachusetts in boston and davin reed a doctoral student at n y u finds that when violent crime falls sharply wealthier and educated people are more likely to move into and predominantly minority urban neighborhoods their working paper suggests that just as rising crime can drive people out of cities falling crime has a comparable effect spurring gentrification and it highlights how even if many americans including by his own words donald trump inaccurately believe urban violence is soaring the opposite trend has brought change to cities we re trying to help people understand what a dramatic difference the reduction in violent crime in particular has made in our environment ms ellen said that has repercussions far beyond what we think of the homicide rate has gone down that s directly the most important consequence but there are all sorts of repercussions as well this really has been a sea change nationally violent crime peaked in 1991 it fell precipitously for the next decade then more slowly through the 2000s and there s a whole other set of theories about why that has happened while homicides have increased recently in some cities rates remain far below what they were 25 years ago including in chicago another reality check while we re at it mr trump said during the 2016 campaign that homicides in his new home in washington were rising by 50 percent apparently citing the previous year s crime statistics at that time in july though the rate in the city was already falling compared with 2015 and by year s end it was down by 17 percent the new research looked at confidential geocoded data from the 1990 and 2000 censuses and more recent american community surveys to identify the neighborhoods where more than four million households moved using citywide violent crime data from the f b i the scholars tracked the changing probability of different demographic groups moving into central cities as opposed to suburbs as crime fell and movers and to a lesser degree whites appeared significantly more sensitive to changing crime levels in their housing decisions than other groups and minority households for instance didn t become more likely to move to cities as they grew safer that may reflect the fact ms ellen suggested that families have more experience or confidence in their ability to navigate crime or it may suggest that attention to violence is a luxury in housing decisions that the poor and minorities may not have a household facing racial discrimination high housing costs or the need to be near supportive family members simply has fewer options and less leeway to be choosy than the households that this research identifies when cities feel safer that opens people s eyes ms ellen said of the willingness of new groups to consider these neighborhoods it s entirely likely that the arrival of more affluent residents affected crime too either by increasing opportunities for property crime in the short term or by adding eyes on the street and pressure on the police in the long run because this research looked at moves that occurred after crime was already falling the authors believe the movers were reacting to changes in crime and not simply causing it themselves but the relationship between crime and gentrification in particular is complex wealthier residents may bring new tensions to neighborhoods fearing and reporting criminal activity where none exists and such demographic change in cities could play a role in pressuring the police to pursue tactics that feel unduly aggressive to the people who preceded the newcomers this study also doesn t offer evidence that existing residents were displaced by the new arrivals many of the urban neighborhoods studied had lost population so they had room to grow again without pushing existing residents out but the possibility that these trends portend higher housing costs and more housing demand in the future in poorer minority neighborhoods adds a cautionary note ms ellen said to the declining crime trend ',\n",
       " 'nice france at times it was hard to know who was on trial the smuggler or the state the defendant cédric herrou 37 a slightly built olive farmer did not deny that for months he had illegally spirited dozens of migrants through the remote mountain valley where he lives he would do it again he suggested instead when asked by a judge why do you do all this mr herrou turned the tables and questioned the humanity of france s practice of rounding up and turning back africans entering illegally from italy in search of work and a better life it was ignoble he said there are people dying on the side of the road mr herrou replied it s not right there are children who are not safe it is enraging to see children at 2 in the morning completely dehydrated i am a frenchman mr herrou declared the trial which began on wednesday is no ordinary one it has been substantially covered by the french news media for its rich symbolism and for the way it neatly sums up the ambiguity of france s policy toward the unceasing flow of migrants into europe and the quandary they present france foremost among european nations prides itself on enlightened humanitarianism fraternity and solidarity and yet perhaps first among them too it is struggling to reconcile those values with the pressing realities of a smaller more globalized world including fear of terrorism the contradictions are being played out in courtrooms in politics and in farmers fields on the sidewalks of paris and in train stations from the côte d azur to the northern port of calais where the government demolished a giant migrant camp in the fall on the one hand politicians in this year s presidential election are competing to see who can take the toughest line on securing france s borders most are promising a crackdown on migrants with admission reserved for cases of political persecution terrorist attacks including the one last summer in nice that killed 85 people have exacerbated sentiment but in these remote mountain valleys where jews fleeing the nazis and the vichy collaborators found refuge during world war ii mr herrou has become something of a folk hero by leading a kind of loosely knit underground railroad to smuggle migrants north many destined for britain or germany his work has won him admiration for his resistance to the state and his stand that it is simply right to help one s fellow man woman or child others in this region seem to agree in the square outside the courthouse hundreds of sympathizers gathered and shouted we are all children of immigrants mr herrou got a hero s welcome as he descended the steep steps late in the evening trailed by television cameras inside not even the prosecutor prêtre seemed to want him there and praised his cause as noble he asked for an sentence but quickly reassured the court that it should be suspended of course still the law is the law he s demonstrated a manifest intention to violate the law mr prêtre told the court one can criticize it but it s got to be applied the verdict which will be made by the panel of three judges who heard the case this week there was no jury of peers is scheduled to be announced on feb 10 the appeal for leniency was both an acknowledgment of widespread discomfort with the law as a well as recognition of mr herrou s growing status in the region around nice and its mountainous backcountry the roya valley mr herrou was voted azuréen of the year last month by the readers of the leading local newspaper to the fury of regional officials i am cédric read one of the placards in the crowd long live the righteous of the roya read another the courtroom on wednesday was filled with people from the mountain the men bearded and ponytailed the women in duffel coats who had come to support mr herrou and who were convinced right was on their side the notion that mr herrou is trying to uphold what he sees as basic french values rather than violating the law is much of the reason he appears to enjoy a considerable measure of popular support the argument formed the essence of his lawyer s defense strategy remember the last word in the french republic s motto liberté egalité fraternité his lawyer zia oloumi told the court they are saying m herrou is endangering the republic mr oloumi told the three judges on the contrary i think he is defending its values you see you have got this value fraternity and the dictionary is quite clear mr oloumi said think about the impact of your decision on the practical application of the idea of fraternity mr herrou was not making any political points mr oloumi insisted he was merely responding to a humanitarian crisis in his own backyard the roya valley had become a way station for migrants the judges did not respond but the lightness of the sentence called for by mr prêtre suggested that the concepts invoked by mr oloumi had resonance mr herrou s accusers seemed most taken aback by his stubbornness not every migrant mr herrou picks up is by the side of the road he finds many outside the migrant camp across the italian border at ventimiglia looking especially for women and children the presiding judge laurie duca reminded him he had first been arrested in august near his mountainside home at with a van full of migrants at that time the prosecutor released him suggesting that mr herrou s humanitarian motivations absolved him that first arrest was evidently merely a warning after august you said you knew it was illegal judge duca remarked in court no matter mr herrou persisted describing his work to journalists last fall and even occupying a disused summer camp owned by the state railroad when his own modest homestead became overwhelmed at that point in the authorities decided they had had enough of him you were there and you were extremely active the judge said why so much press mr herrou replied it is right that society should know about all this the judge and the prosecutor suggested that this time mr herrou would not get the humanitarian pass he had benefited from previously the local political establishment is furious with him at the very moment when we need strict controls mr herrou s ideological premeditated actions are a major risk eric ciotti the president of the departmental council and a leading member of parliament wrote in mr prêtre the prosecutor suggested that mr herrou s persistence and openness had been his undoing mr herrou acknowledges everything mr prêtre said with astonishment this trial springs from a communications strategy for a cause that i totally respect and yet this is what he told the police he said i am violating the law but i am the prosecutor i must defend the law ',\n",
       " 'as it happens donald j trump is not the only person to announce plans to shut down a personal philanthropy just the best known this is the story of a man who made and kept that same promise nearly five years ago charles f feeney sat in a cushy armchair in an apartment on the east side of manhattan grandchildren s artwork taped to the walls and said that by the end of 2016 he was going to hand out the last of a great fortune that he had made it was a race mr feeney was then 81 and atlantic philanthropies a collection of private foundations he had started and funded still had about 1 5 billion left flinging money out the window or writing checks was not mr feeney s way last month mr feeney and atlantic completed the sprint and made a final grant 7 million to cornell university to support students doing community service work he had officially emptied his pockets meeting his aspiration of giving while living altogether he had contributed 8 billion to his philanthropies which have supported higher education public health human rights and scientific research you re always nervous handling so much money but we seem to have worked it pretty well mr feeney now 85 said last week in a phone interview his remaining personal net worth is slightly more than 2 million that s not quite broke by any standard but it is a modest amount for a man who controlled thousands of times as much wealth he and his wife helga now live in a rented apartment in san francisco you can only wear one pair of pants at a time mr feeney has said until he was 75 he traveled only in coach and carried reading materials in a plastic bag for many years when in new york he had lunch not at the city s luxury restaurants but in the homey confines of tommy makem s irish pavilion on east 57th street where he ate the burgers none of the major american philanthropists have given away a greater proportion of their wealth and starting in 1982 mr feeney did most of this in complete secrecy leading forbes magazine to call him the james bond of philanthropy his name does not appear in gilded letters chiseled marble or other forms of writing anywhere on the 1 000 buildings across five continents that 2 7 billion of his money paid for for years atlantic s support came with a requirement that the beneficiaries not publicize its involvement beyond mr feeney s reticence about blowing his own horn it was also a way to leverage more donations some other individual might contribute to get the naming rights said christopher g oechsli the president and chief executive officer of atlantic during the early 1990s mr feeney met secretly with paramilitary forces in belfast northern ireland urging them to drop armed guerrilla conflict and promising financial support if they embraced electoral politics atlantic grants paid to create a public health system in vietnam and to provide access to antiretroviral treatment for aids in southern africa the last rounds of grants about 600 million included support for atlantic fellows described as young emerging leaders working in their countries for healthier more equitable societies raised in elizabeth n j mr feeney served as a radio operator in the air force and attended cornell university on the g i bill in 1960 he and a partner set up a company that sold items like brandy and cigars to travelers in shops at airports it became a booming success mr feeney has also been a shrewd investor in technology in 1984 he secretly transferred all of his assets including his 38 75 percent ownership of the business to atlantic philanthropies he grew the atlantic pot with early investments in companies like facebook priceline alibaba and legent a business dispute in 1997 forced disclosure of mr feeney s funding for atlantic as for mr trump if he really does shut down his foundation stung by inquiries about the use of foundation money to pay mr trump s personal liabilities or purchase football helmet memorabilia or oil paintings of himself he is not likely to follow the feeney model the two men are mirror images for years mr trump lobbied hard to get onto lists of the wealthy like the forbes 400 mr feeney has tried to stay off them the atlantic endowment came entirely from mr feeney s money much of the money that went into the trump foundation in recent years was from others one of atlantic s projects was to propose reforms to the american health care system which helped lay groundwork for the affordable care act another was advocacy for the end of the death penalty for juveniles mr trump has been on the other side of both of those issues vowing to dismantle obamacare on day 1 and calling in 1989 for the restoration of the death penalty after five teenagers were arrested in the rape of a jogger in central park they were convicted but later cleared of the charges just as mr trump was opening trump tower on fifth avenue in the early 1980s mr feeney was a few blocks away in makem s pub thinking about the first big checks he would write for charity on the condition that his identity not be disclosed i don t recall ever meeting trump mr feeney said last week no wonder the thought crossed my mind 20 years ago that chuck feeney is what donald trump would be if he lived his entire existence backward ',\n",
       " 'san francisco the virtual currency bitcoin has been swept up in yet another speculative frenzy pushing its price toward the peak it last reached in late 2013 the price of bitcoin has been buoyed by increased interest from places like venezuela where the local currency has lost much of its value and india where the government recently removed the largest cash notes from circulation more broadly a tilt toward isolationism that has emerged in american and european politics highlighted by donald j trump s election victory has given a new sheen to a currency that can move between countries with little oversight the more there is an expectation for new barriers to be erected the more there is an expectation that bitcoin will be valuable for moving money across borders said gil luria the director of research at wedbush securities still most of the people actually buying and selling bitcoin these days are coming from a single country china some wealthy chinese have used bitcoin to evade their government s strict controls on moving money in and out of the country according to bitcoin specialists in china but the heavy trading on chinese bitcoin exchanges much of it by automated software suggests that most of the price movement is a result of bets by speculators in recent days the price of a bitcoin has been about 3 percent higher on these exchanges than on dollar denominated exchanges suggesting more demand in china than outside the importance of speculators suggests that the value of bitcoin is still driven by the hope of how it might be used someday rather than real world use today which has generally been hard to quantify in dollar terms a bitcoin was going for about 1 025 on tuesday or about 140 percent more than what it cost at the beginning of 2016 the volatile price has led many analysts to conclude that is less similar to a currency than to a commodity like gold which has a value resulting from its scarcity in bitcoin s case the rules of the network dictate that only 21 million bitcoin will ever be created the recent rise has brought the price of one bitcoin to within striking distance of the price of an ounce of gold which was about 1 150 on monday the price has increased in the last year despite the lack of interest in bitcoin from banks and a majority of more sophisticated investors after showing early interest in the currency most big banks have moved on to make investments in the blockchain the new type of ledger technology introduced by bitcoin while eschewing bitcoin itself some central banks have talked about issuing their own national currencies on some sort of blockchain inspired by but unrelated to the blockchain that bitcoin uses bitcoin and the blockchain were introduced in late 2008 by a mysterious coder who used the name satoshi nakamoto anyone with a computer and internet access can open a bitcoin wallet and help maintain the blockchain ledger where all bitcoin transactions are recorded because it is run by a decentralized network of computers around the world bitcoin does not require a central authority like a central bank or financial institution that has made it attractive to people who hope to do financial transactions anonymously such as the drug dealers who have sold illicit goods for bitcoin on the silk road website and its successors new bitcoins are released at regular intervals to computers helping to support the bitcoin network and previously released bitcoins can be bought and sold on exchanges around the world since 2009 the price of bitcoin has generally been defined by long periods of stability marked by short periods of speculative excitement the only other time the price of bitcoin has exceeded 1 000 was in late 2013 when the demand was driven by a surge of interest from chinese investors and traders the price soon crashed when one of the largest bitcoin exchanges mt gox which was based in tokyo and went bankrupt announced that it had lost most of the bitcoins held by its customers the cause remains in dispute the bitcoin price fell to its low under 200 in early 2015 since then the price has risen in fits and starts in part because of continuing hacking and fraud and because of fights over the direction of the bitcoin network many bitcoin businesses have wanted to edit the basic bitcoin software to change the number of transactions that can move through the network every day but the proposed changes have run into opposition from the team of coders responsible for maintaining the basic bitcoin software many chinese bitcoin companies have sided with the coders that disagreement has led to slowdowns on the bitcoin network with some transactions taking days to be processed the slowdowns have made it harder to use bitcoin for everyday payments but through the controversy the security of the basic bitcoin wallets and transaction software has held up making it a potential alternative for people in countries with less secure currencies and financial institutions in november interest in bitcoin spiked in india after the government announced moves to quickly ban the largest indian bank notes in an effort to crack down on corruption the continued fall in the value of the venezuelan currency the bolívar has led to reports about venezuelans desperate to exchange their money for bitcoin but despite the new demand the total value of all outstanding bitcoin about 16 billion is still only that of a american company and is not large enough to sustain the demand of even a moderate number of indians or venezuelans looking to store their wealth in the virtual currency that points back to the importance of speculators who are betting that someday soon people worldwide will turn to bitcoin for their daily financial needs and push the price much higher i ascribe only 10 percent of the value of bitcoin to current day usage and more like 90 percent of it to the expectation of future usage mr luria of webush securities said ',\n",

       " 'washington president vladimir v putin of russia directed a vast cyberattack aimed at denying hillary clinton the presidency and installing donald j trump in the oval office the nation s top intelligence agencies said in an extraordinary report they delivered on friday to mr trump the officials presented their unanimous conclusions to mr trump in a briefing at trump tower in new york that brought the leaders of america s intelligence agencies face to face with their most vocal skeptic the who has repeatedly cast doubt on russia s role the meeting came just two weeks before mr trump s inauguration and was underway even as the electoral votes from his victory were being formally counted in a joint session of congress soon after leaving the meeting intelligence officials released the declassified damning report that described the sophisticated cybercampaign as part of a continuing russian effort to weaken the united states government and its democratic institutions the report a virtually revelation by the american intelligence agencies that undermined the legitimacy of the president who is about to direct them made the case that mr trump was the favored candidate of mr putin the russian leader the report said sought to denigrate mrs clinton and the report detailed what the officials had revealed to president obama a day earlier mr trump s victory followed a complicated multipart cyberinformation attack whose goal had evolved to help the republican win the report did not conclude that russian involvement tipped the election to mr trump the public report lacked the evidence that intelligence officials said was included in a classified version which they described as information on the sources and methods used to collect the information about mr putin and his associates those would include intercepts of conversations and the harvesting of computer data from implants that the united states and its allies have put in russian computer networks much of the unclassified report focused instead on an overt kremlin propaganda campaign that would be unlikely to convince skeptics of the report s more serious conclusions the report may be a political blow to mr trump but it is also a risky moment for the intelligence agencies that have become more powerful since the sept 11 2001 attacks but have had to fend off allegations that they exaggerated intelligence during the buildup to the iraq war the declassified report did describe in detail the efforts of mr putin and his security services including the creation of the online guccifer 2 0 persona and dcleaks com to release information gained from the hacks to the public putin and the russian government aspired to help trump s election chances when possible by discrediting secretary clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him the report by the nation s intelligence agencies concluded mr trump whose resistance to that very conclusion has led him to repeatedly mock the country s intelligence services on twitter since election day issued a written statement that appeared to concede some russian involvement but mr trump said nothing about the conclusion that mr putin had sought to aid his candidacy other than insisting that he still believes the russian attacks had no effect on the outcome the s written statement came just hours after mr trump told the new york times in an interview that the storm surrounding russian hacking was nothing more than a political witch hunt carried out by his adversaries who he said were embarrassed by their loss to him in the 2016 election speaking by telephone three hours before the intelligence briefing mr trump repeatedly criticized the intense focus on russia china relatively recently hacked 20 million government names he said referring to the breach of computers at the office of personnel management in late 2014 and early 2015 how come nobody even talks about that this is a political witch hunt later mr trump sought to blame the democrats for any cyberattacks that might have occurred gross negligence by the democratic national committee allowed hacking to take place he said in a twitter message posted about 11 p m the republican national committee had strong defense vice mike pence told reporters that he and mr trump had appreciated the presentation by the intelligence officials and described the conversation as respectful mr pence said the new administration would take aggressive action to combat cyberattacks and protect the security of the american people from this type of intrusion in the future mr trump who has consistently questioned the evidence of russian hacking during the election did so again friday before he met with the intelligence officials asked why he thought there was so much attention on the russian cyberattacks the said the motivation was political he also repeated his criticism of the american intelligence agencies saying that a lot of mistakes were made in the past noting in particular the attacks on the world trade center and saying as he has repeatedly that weapons of mass destruction was one of the great mistakes of all time but after meeting with the intelligence officials mr trump appeared to moderate his position conceding that russia china other countries outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyberinfrastructure of our governmental institutions businesses and organizations including the democrat national committee the report described a broad campaign of covert operations including the trolling on the internet of people who were viewed as opponents of russia s effort while it accused russian intelligence agencies of obtaining and maintaining access to elements of multiple u s state or local electoral boards it concluded as officials have publicly that there was no evidence of tampering with the tallying of the vote on nov 8 the report reflecting the assessments of the c i a the f b i and the national security agency stopped short of backing up mr trump on his declaration that the hacking activity had no effect on the election we did not make an assessment of the impact that russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election the report concluded saying it was beyond its responsibility to analyze american political processes or public opinion the intelligence agencies also concluded with high confidence that russia s main military intelligence unit the g r u created a persona called guccifer 2 0 and a website dcleaks com to release the emails of the democratic national committee and of the chairman of the clinton campaign john d podesta when those disclosures received what was seen as insufficient attention the report said the g r u relayed material it acquired from the d n c and senior democratic officials to wikileaks the founder of wikileaks julian assange has denied that russia was the source of the emails it published the role of rt the russian news organization that american intelligence says is a kremlin propaganda operation in the kremlin s effort to influence the election is covered in far more detail by the report than any other aspect of the russian campaign an annex in the report on rt which was first written in 2012 but not previously made public takes up eight pages of the report s main section the report s unequivocal assessment of rt presents an awkward development for lt gen michael t flynn who is mr trump s choice to serve as national security adviser mr flynn has appeared repeatedly on rt s news programs and in december 2015 was paid by the network to give a speech in russia and attend its lavish anniversary party where he sat at the elbow of mr putin mr flynn has since defended his speech insisting that rt is no different from cnn or msnbc the report also stated that russia collected data on some targets but did not disclose the contents of whatever it harvested intelligence officials who prepared the classified report have concluded that british intelligence was among the first to raise an alarm that moscow hacked into the democratic national committee s computer servers and alerted their american counterparts according to two people familiar with the conclusions the british role which has been closely held is a critical part of the timeline because it suggests that some of the first tipoffs in fall 2015 came from voice intercepts computer traffic or informants outside the united states as emails and other data from the democratic national committee flowed out of the country the conclusions in the report were described on thursday to president obama and on friday to mr trump by james r clapper jr the director of national intelligence john o brennan the director of the c i a adm michael s rogers the director of the national security agency and james b comey the director of the f b i the key to the public report s assessment is that russia s motives evolved over the course of the campaign when it appeared that mrs clinton was more likely to win it concluded the russian effort focused on undermining her future presidency with bloggers preparing a twitter campaign with the hashtag democracyrip it noted that mr putin had a particular animus for mrs clinton because he believed she had incited protests against him in 2011 yet the attacks the report said began long before anyone could have known that mr trump considered a dark horse would win the republican nomination it said the attacks began as early as july 2015 when russian intelligence operatives first gained access to the democratic national committee s networks russia maintained that access for 11 months until at least june 2016 the report concludes leaving open the possibility that russian cyberattackers may have had access even after the firm crowdstrike believed that it had kicked them off the networks ',\n",
       " 'the intelligence agencies report on the russian intervention in the american presidential election portrays it as just one piece of an propaganda campaign but it was a campaign made enormously more powerful by the tools of the cyberage private emails pilfered by hackers an internet that reaches into most american homes social media to promote its revelations and smear enemies what most americans may have seen as a effort brazen meddling by russia in the very core of american democracy was the report says only part of a information war that involves not just shadowy hackers and websites but also more conventional news outlets including the thriving russian television network rt the election intervention to damage hillary clinton and lift donald j trump was the latest fusillade in a campaign that has gone on under the radar for years for the three agencies that produced the report the c i a the f b i and the national security agency this is a moment they have just told their new boss that he was elected with the vigorous multifaceted help of an adversary the thuggish autocrat who rules russia putin and the russian government aspired to help trump s election chances when possible by discrediting secretary clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him the report says in unusually blunt and sweeping language perhaps most arresting is the assessment that vladimir v putin the russian president sees the election attack as payback not offense but defense he has borne a serious grudge against mrs clinton who he believes denigrated him when she was secretary of state and encouraged the protests in moscow that erupted against him in 2011 mr putin the report says sees the hidden hand of the united states in the leaking of the panama papers files stolen from a law firm that exposed the wealth of his closest associates secreted in offshore accounts he even blames the united states for the exposure carried out mainly by international sports authorities of russian athletes for their widespread use of drugs from the russian perspective this is punching back said christopher porter a former c i a officer who now studies cyberattacks at the firm fireeye we may not think that s fair or justified but that s the way they see it mr porter said mr putin had made no secret of his view that the united states by promoting democracy in countries like ukraine and georgia had interfered in russia s backyard and was trying to undermine its power what is missing from the public report is what many americans most eagerly anticipated hard evidence to back up the agencies claims that the russian government engineered the election attack that is a significant omission mr trump has been expressing skepticism for months that russia was to blame variously wondering whether it might have been china or a guy or a guy from new jersey there is only a whisper of dissent in the report the eavesdroppers of the n s a believe with only moderate confidence that russia aimed to help mr trump while their colleagues at the c i a and the f b i have high confidence while most of congress and much of the public appears to accept the agencies findings mr trump s prominent doubts accompanied at times by scorn for the agencies competence has rallied a diverse array of skeptics on the right and the left under the circumstances many in washington expected the agencies to make a strong public case to erase any uncertainty instead the message from the agencies essentially amounts to trust us there is no discussion of the forensics used to recognize the handiwork of known hacking groups no mention of intercepted communications between the kremlin and the hackers no hint of spies reporting from inside moscow s propaganda machinery at the top of every page of the report is a disclaimer that acknowledges what is missing this report is a declassified version of a highly classified assessment its conclusions are identical to those in the highly classified assessment but this version does not include the full supporting information on key elements of the influence campaign it offers an obvious reason for leaving out the details declaring that including the precise bases for its assessments would reveal sensitive sources or methods and imperil the ability to collect critical foreign intelligence in the future the absence of any proof is especially surprising in light of promises on thursday from the director of national intelligence james r clapper jr that he would push the envelope to try to make more information public josh earnest the white house press secretary said that mr obama had directed officials to make as much of it public as they possibly can that will not be enough for many as the initial reaction showed while some welcomed the scope of the report many others were disappointed this is big cia nsa fbi publish perhaps the most intelligence community assessment in us history thomas rid a professor at king s college london and an expert on cyberwarfare wrote on twitter but susan hennessey a former intelligence agency lawyer who is now the managing editor of the online journal lawfare wrote the unclassified report is underwhelming at best there is essentially no new information for those who have been paying attention though the unclassified report is 25 pages long counting the covers and several blank pages the core analysis runs just five pages that is less than the annex devoted to rt america the television network it is a description of the broadcaster from an intelligence report written in 2012 years before the hacking took place the agencies have taken an look at the broader russian strategy said mr porter the former c i a officer the detailed description of rt s tactics though years old he added was included because they fit that strategy mr trump may have been persuaded by his classified briefing on friday on the russian attack which included everything that the unclassified report leaves out even if the statement he issued afterward seemed lukewarm but this report is unlikely to change the minds of skeptics who like the remember the intelligence agencies faulty assessments on iraqi weapons of mass destruction and fear being misled again ',\n",

to the managing director of a texas horse and cattle ranch but mr tillerson is prepared to resign from all those posts sell all his stock and put much of his money into bland investments like treasury bonds if he becomes secretary of state according to an ethics undertakings memo he filed this week with the state department and if he returns to the oil industry in the next decade he could lose as much as 180 million the ethics letter detailing mr tillerson s commitments is the first of hundreds that will be made public in the coming weeks by members of donald j trump s cabinet and other top political appointees presenting a historic test of the federal government s ability to identify conflicts of interest and figure out ways to avoid them mr trump has selected what would be the wealthiest cabinet in modern american history filled with millionaires and billionaires with complicated financial portfolios mr tillerson is worth at least 300 million but is hardly the richest among them wilbur l ross jr the commerce secretary nominee betsy devos the education secretary nominee and steven t mnuchin the treasury secretary nominee each hold assets estimated at more than a billion dollars jared kushner mr trump s wealthy is in the process of submitting his own forms as he prepares to take a formal white house position people involved in the process said the office of government ethics is stressed no doubt about that said robert rizzi a partner at steptoe johnson who represents half a dozen trump administration nominees going through the process although he would not name them citing confidentiality agreements they are having some difficulty keeping up all of the cabinet appointees and hundreds of others must submit a financial disclosure report detailing all the assets they own their approximate value and income from any source they have made in the last year some of the nominees are so wealthy and their assets so varied there are not enough boxes on the standard form for them lawyers involved in the process said the disclosures are then used by the agencies they are to take over along with the office of government ethics to identify potential conflicts of interest and to negotiate ethics letters to be signed by the nominees committing to avoid conflicts of interest at the same time this class of wealthy incoming officials could save hundreds of millions of dollars in income tax payments thanks to a special tax benefit created so that affluent americans do not avoid federal government jobs the trump administration lawyers involved in the effort said is behind where it should be in this process of disentangling conflicts of interest this is partly a reflection of the extraordinary complexity of negotiating such conflict of interest agreements for incoming government officials worth hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars usually you just own a bunch of stocks and bonds but he s getting people that own buildings and real estate and stuff you can t sell said alan johnson a new compensation consultant he has wilbur ross who is probably involved in a gazillion different things i think it is going to be very complicated to try to disentangle all of these things mr ross is a billionaire investor and former banker who made a fortune in steel coal telecommunications and other industries under federal law executive branch employees including cabinet members are prohibited from using their positions in the government to enrich themselves meaning they are not allowed to participate in any particular matter that might directly financially benefit assets they own the best way to avoid such a conflict said lawrence m noble former general counsel at the federal election commission is to sell any assets like exxon mobil stock or any individual company stock and put proceeds into treasury bonds or mutual funds we don t want the decisions that these individuals make to be influenced in reality or even appearance by their own financial interests mr noble said they are working for the american people and not to enrich themselves or their families the rules do not apply to the president and vice president although ethics experts and even the office of government ethics have urged mr trump to divest his assets voluntarily to rid himself of potential concerns as he takes over the white house he has thus far resisted such a move saying that he plans to let his two oldest sons and other trump organization executives manage the business perhaps with an outside monitor for appointees like mr tillerson the transition to government can have lucrative benefits they can take advantage of measures in the tax code meant to be an incentive for wealthy people to consider public service jobs the measure was put in place during the administration of the first president george bush this tax benefit which requires approval by the office of government ethics allows government officials to defer paying capital gains taxes on certain assets that they must sell in order to clear potential conflicts as they take office essentially providing them with loans to gain the tax advantage the liquidated proceeds must then be invested in treasury bonds mutual funds or funds and the official must seek a certificate of divestiture until now henry m paulson jr treasury secretary under president george w bush has been the most prominent example of a public official who has taken advantage of the divestiture certificate in 2006 mr paulson left goldman sachs and sold an estimated 500 million in goldman stock deferring taxes on the sale in his memo mr tillerson suggested that he was likely to seek such a certificate and laid out a series of plans to divorce himself from financial engagements board appointments and exxon mobil this means he will most likely avoid capital gains taxes based on his sale of 50 million in exxon mobil stock he owns as well as shares in more than 150 companies including airbus and the walt disney company all of which he has promised to sell off within 90 days of his confirmation his ethics documents suggest but a more complicated task involved resolving the fate of two million shares of exxon mobil stock worth about 180 million that mr tillerson was set to receive over the next decade if he held on to this promised future payout from exxon mobil he would still have a financial interest in matters that might affect the company and the oil industry so exxon mobil agreed to take the unusual step of paying out the value of these sales and putting the money into an independent trust with the money invested in neutral assets like treasury bonds and mutual funds under the terms of the agreement if mr tillerson 64 goes back into the oil industry during the next decade he will forfeit any money left in the account richard w painter a white house ethics lawyer during the administration of president george w bush said this provision preventing mr tillerson from returning to the oil industry was unusual and positive as it removes the incentive for him to take steps while in government that might benefit an industry he planned to return to work for upon his departure it gives up something i had never been able to get from other government officials a promise not to go back to an industry from which you came mr painter said still some environmental activists say such steps cannot address what they argue will be mr tillerson s inherent bias in the state department it is impossible for this man to remove his career and frankly his personality from the oil and gas industry said lena moffitt director of a sierra club campaign trying to reduce the nation s reliance on fossil fuels he has been knee deep in this industry

       " 'it has been a long time coming eight years in fact but the economic recovery is finally showing up in the average american worker s paycheck in a big way there have been plenty of winners in the recovery which began in companies homeowners investors and especially households at the apex of the economic pyramid but the paucity of gains in pay has stoked anxiety and frustration for many others a factor in the wave of discontent that donald j trump rode to victory in november but even as mr trump prepares to succeed president obama in two weeks the labor department reported on friday that average hourly earnings rose by 2 9 percent last year the best annual performance since the recovery began and many economists expect the trend to gain momentum this year as a tighter labor market forces employers to pay more to hire and retain workers this is a turning point for the overall economy said diane swonk a veteran independent economist in chicago while wage growth was robust last year government data for december showed a more tepid increase in employment with 156 000 jobs added during the month and a slight uptick in the unemployment rate to 4 7 percent until recently a rise in salaries one month would peter out the next but the upward trajectory in 2016 reflects wage gains even for americans at the low end of the pay scale ms swonk said leisure and hospitality workers for example saw hourly earnings jump 4 4 percent from a year earlier equal to the increase enjoyed by employees in the surging technology sector to be sure a number of the economic problems cited by mr trump during the campaign remain millions of former workers not even looking for jobs ebbing factory positions and fewer opportunities for the 55 percent of americans without college degrees or other school credentials strong economic growth doesn t really matter if it s not widely distributed ms swonk said you can have a better economy but still not good enough for people who aren t participating at all a more comprehensive government barometer of unemployment which includes workers forced to take jobs because positions were not available stood at 9 2 percent in december a much higher level than at this point in past recoveries but rising wages should counter the economic undertow especially if the gains remain and while a 2 9 percent increase may not sound like much it goes much further because inflation is about 1 7 percent economists expect wages to rise by up to 3 5 percent in 2017 still below the gains many workers saw in the recovery of the and in the boom of the late 1990s although not reflected in the december figures many workers are getting raises this year because of state increases in the local minimum wage some of the increases were substantial with arizona maine and washington each raising the floor by 1 50 or more an hour even in california where at 50 cents an hour the wage gain is not as steep one in 10 workers has gotten a raise and gains can have a spillover effect pushing up pay for workers just above the bottom salary tier for all his criticism during the campaign of mr obama s economic stewardship mr trump will inherit an economy that is fundamentally solid consumer sentiment corporate profits and the stock market are all at or near multiyear highs on friday wall street embraced the labor market figures lifting the dow jones industrial average close to 20 000 and a new nominal record investors and traders are watching the jobs data closely for clues about when the federal reserve board may next raise interest rates last month the fed increased interest rates for only the second time in a decade and policy makers signaled that three more increases could come this year the wage gains are among the reasons the fed is likely to stick to that plan ms swonk the chicago economist said monthly job creation last year was well below the 236 000 average for hiring in 2014 and 2015 but with the economy close to what fed policy makers and other experts consider full employment employers are increasing wages to retain workers and to attract new ones while the minimum wage increases provide a floor when it comes to pay the ceiling continues to rise in fields like financial services sales and technology said tom gimbel chief executive of lasalle network a chicago staffing company across the board i see more aggressive salaries being offered by corporations than at any time in the last 10 years mr gimbel said seasoned sales representatives are drawing base salaries of 150 000 a year compared with 125 000 two years ago according to mr gimbel software developers who once started at around 50 000 a year can now command 70 000 other executives in the midwest also report upward pressure on wages including in grittier settings than the fields where engineers and financial professionals cluster at lou malnati s pizzeria which has 46 restaurants in the chicago area and one in phoenix pay in hourly positions like server cook and dishwasher is now about 11 50 an hour compared with 10 an hour three years ago mark agnew the chain s president said most of the increase was a result of the steady rise in chicago s minimum wage which has gone from 8 25 in 2014 to 10 50 now it is set to hit 13 by summer 2019 we want to stay ahead of the minimum wage because we want to attract the best talent mr agnew said a substantial portion of the chain s 3 000 workers have been with the company for more than 10 years a rarity in the restaurant industry that is another benefit of the slightly higher wages economists and politicians have long debated whether raising the minimum wage ultimately hurts workers as companies cut positions or leave them unfilled in the face of rising labor costs so far that has not been the case at lou malnati s mr agnew said the chain has opened about a dozen new locations in the past three years adding about 600 workers to its payroll over all it s very tricky and i know the minimum wage may erode job creation in some industries he said but in my own company it hasn t hurt hiring ',\n",

mentally disturbed and heard voices in his head telling him to commit acts of violence according to a senior law enforcement official the gunman identified as esteban santiago 26 walked into the f b i office in anchorage in november and made disturbing remarks that prompted officials to urge him to seek mental health care mr santiago appearing agitated and incoherent said that his mind was being controlled by a u s intelligence agency the official said other officials said it was too early to tell whether mr santiago who was captured in the airport had been inspired by terrorist groups including the islamic state the officials said he had viewed extremist materials on the internet shortly after 1 p m friday the suspect who had been an airline passenger pulled a semiautomatic handgun out of his bag and opened fire in a crowded baggage claim area in terminal 2 officials said the shooting spurred a scene of panic and confusion that played out on live television as scores of travelers burst out of the terminal and onto the tarmac running and seeking cover at times in response to erroneous rumors of attacks david fogarty a carpenter from key west was heading to cancún mexico on vacation when the people around him suddenly began running toward the gates everybody was dropping gear panicking jumping over tables mr fogarty said in a phone interview we were saying what is going on are there people shooting i am not hearing any gunshots and the whole place is panicking officers took mr santiago into custody without firing a shot and on friday evening he was being interviewed by f b i agents and county investigators as the wounded were being treated at hospitals the senior law enforcement official said mr santiago was making disjointed statements in his anchorage f b i visit although santiago stated that he did not wish to harm anyone as a result of his erratic behavior interviewing agents contacted local authorities who took him to a medical facility for evaluation the official said the f b i closed its assessment of santiago after conducting database reviews interagency checks and interviews of his family members the official said on twitter donald j trump said that he was monitoring the terrible situation in florida and that he had spoken to gov rick scott hours after the attack a picture began to emerge of mr santiago as a man who had served his country but who had experienced trouble and failure mr santiago was discharged in august from the alaska army national guard for unsatisfactory performance according to lt col candis a olmstead the spokeswoman for the alaska guard in september mr santiago became a father when his son was born according to an aunt maria luisa ruiz a resident of union city n j who spoke on friday to the newspaper the record in an email ms olmstead said that mr santiago joined the puerto rico national guard in december 2007 in 2010 he deployed to balad iraq with the 130th engineer battalion which spent a year clearing roads of improvised explosives and maintaining bridges he was awarded a meritorious unit commendation at least two soldiers from his company were killed in insurgent attacks during the tour but there is nothing in the record that indicates mr santiago had been in combat ms olmstead said he served in the army reserves before joining the alaska army national guard in november 2014 before his discharge last year he worked as a combat engineer as a private first class an official service record released on friday by the army showed that mr santiago had received a number of commendations including the army good conduct medal mr santiago s brother bryan santiago told the associated press that esteban was born in new jersey and moved to puerto rico when he was 2 nelson cruz a puerto rico senator who represents peñuelas the city in puerto rico where mr santiago grew up said he met mr santiago about seven or eight years ago and found him to be a good young man who loved his family mr cruz said he spoke on friday with bryan santiago who relayed that the family was shocked by the news of the killings the family offered no known motive for the crime but noted that esteban had recently been hallucinating and was receiving psychological treatment bryan said his brother went to iraq or afghanistan one of those places and came back with psychological problems mr cruz said he would suddenly see visions but that he was a calm young man and was never violent esteban santiago liked sports particularly boxing as bryan is a boxing trainer and was proud of his military career we don t know what happened with this guy mr cruz said he was an intelligent brilliant young man who came back affected when he came back from the conflict he did not return well he added that the family wanted to express condolences but was in a state of panic over the number of news reporters outside their house at a news conference late friday in florida officials warned that learning the gunman s motive would be a long complex process we have not ruled out terrorism and we will pursue every angle to try to determine the motive behind this attack said george piro the special agent in charge of the f b i s miami division the shooting comes at a tense time for a nation that has been watching nervously as terrorist attacks have occurred elsewhere in the world and as mr trump who has promised to bar muslims from entering the country prepares to ascend to the presidency officials said that he had flown on a flight from alaska to minneapolis and then to fort international airport in a facebook post a broward county commissioner chip lamarca said the assailant had been a passenger on a canadian flight who had checked his weapon in his luggage and then upon disembarking went to the airport bathroom to load it came out shooting people in baggage claim mr lamarca wrote on cnn mark lea a witness said the gunman just randomly shot people no rhyme or reason after the shootings the gunman lay facedown spread eagle and waited for the deputies to come get him he said at that point the gunman showed no remorse mr lea said he didn t say anything he said nothing no emotion no nothing about as as you could get witnesses also recounted scenes of confusion and fear all of a sudden there was a stampede said tara webber 41 of allentown pa who was heading home after a cruise to the bahamas and was waiting with relatives in terminal 3 for her flight those who were not running she said hit the floor she and her father dan trinkle 63 dived under a set of plastic chairs ms webber said she almost landed on a little girl who was crying and tried to comfort her this was the scariest thing i ve ever done in my life said ms webber who works for her father s limousine company we re going to get a car and drive all the way home her father said he went for the floor like everyone else then the cops told us to leave all our stuff and get out he said everything was thrown around all over the place mr trickle said the police and airport authorities seemed unsure of how to handle the situation as far as i m concerned they weren t prepared for something like this he said we were all out on the runway for hours it made no sense he said he and his family were allowed to leave after three hours and go to a hospital only because his girlfriend barbara keinert 57 had left her insulin on the cruise ship and needed another dose the suspect s name was made public by senator bill nelson democrat of florida soon after the shooting mr nelson said he had learned the name from the administrator of the transportation security administration peter v neffenger mr nelson said mr neffenger had also told him the suspect was in possession of an american military identification barbara sharief the mayor of broward county said authorities were confident that the gunman had acted alone based on the preliminary reviewing of the footage tapes he is a lone shooter ms sharief said he is alive he was not harmed not shot airport police officers chased the gunman through the terminal as he continued to fire before apprehending him unharmed near a departure gate and arresting him the scene that unspooled after shots rang out was intensely chaotic live tv showed government vehicles blocking the roads to and from the airport and scores of travelers milling on the tarmac apparently having been evacuated from the building some could be seen marching en masse across the pavement wheeling bags behind them moments later the passengers would burst into movement like frightened birds running one way or another apparently in reaction to concerns which authorities later said were unfounded that more attacks were underway a number of witnesses called in to television news programs almost immediately after it happened john schlicher a traveler who spoke in a phone interview with msnbc said he had been traveling with his wife and and they were retrieving their bags from a carousel when he heard the first shot i wasn t sure what it was at first but i saw the person right to my side fall to the ground and i turned and looked and the shooter was in the center hallway he told msnbc mr schlicher did not hear the gunman speak and described him as slender with dark hair and possibly wearing a blue star wars mr schlicher said he and everyone around him dropped to the ground i put my head down and prayed he said the shooting came as florida lawmakers were preparing to consider legislation that would relax prohibitions on firearms state laws allow for the purchase of rifles handguns and shotguns without a permit though a license is required to carry a concealed weapon in the state the legislation which was proposed last month would eliminate some zones in florida which currently include airport terminals schools and government meetings the bill was introduced by state senator greg steube a republican and longtime opponent of zones as the false alarms subsided at the airport the scene remained tense workers and passengers leaving the airport were searched by law enforcement personnel passengers who had been on planes on the tarmac were forced to stay in their seats where they received updates from captains and crew members television news stations showed video of medics taking care of a bleeding victim outside the airport news helicopters showed hundreds of people standing on the tarmac as an ambulance drove by with the airport shut down the federal aviation administration said that flights

a spirit airways flight from ohio when they got caught up in the tide of people who ran down the terminal they joined in and were directed out to the tarmac clustered there with others shifting from

       " 'is your workout getting you nowhere research and lived experience indicate that many people who begin a new exercise program see little if any improvement in their health and fitness even after weeks of studiously sticking with their new routine among fitness scientists these people are known as nonresponders their bodies simply don t respond to the exercise they are doing and once discouraged they often return to being nonexercisers but an inspiring and timely new study suggests that nonresponders to one form of exercise can probably switch to another exercise regimen to which their body will respond and a simple test you can do at home will help you determine how well your workout is working for you one of the first major studies to report the phenomenon of nonresponders appeared in 2001 when researchers parsed data from dozens of previously published studies of running cycling and other endurance exercise the studies showed that on aggregate endurance training increased people s endurance but when the researchers examined individual outcomes the variations were staggering some people had improved their endurance by as much as 100 percent while others had actually become less fit even though they were following the same workout routine age sex and ethnicity had not mattered the researchers noted young people and old had been outliers as had women and men black volunteers and white interestingly nonresponse to endurance training ran in families the researchers discovered suggesting that genetics probably plays a significant role in how people s bodies react to exercise since then other researchers have found that people can have extremely erratic reactions to weight training regimens with some packing on power and mass and others losing both and a study published last year concentrating on brief bouts of intense interval training concluded that some people barely gained endurance with this type of workout while others flourished greatly augmenting their fitness these studies however were not generally designed to tell us whether someone who failed to benefit from one form of exercise might do well with another so for the new experiment which was published in december in the journal plos one researchers from queen s university in kingston ontario and the university of ottawa decided to focus intently on whether a nonresponder to one form of exercise could benefit by switching to another they began by gathering 21 healthy men and women and determining their vo2 max a measure of how much oxygen the lungs can deliver to the muscles heart rates and other physiological parameters related to aerobic fitness then they had each volunteer complete two very different types of workouts each training regimen lasted three weeks and the researchers waited several months before starting the next regimen so that volunteers could return to their baseline fitness one routine involved typical endurance training riding a stationary bicycle four times a week for 30 minutes at a moderately strenuous pace the second type of exercise revolved around intervals each volunteer completed eight intervals of very hard pedaling on a stationary bicycle with 10 seconds of rest after each bout the intervals were brutal but brief at the end of each session the researchers again checked each volunteer s vo2 max and other fitness measures as a group they had gained admirable amounts of fitness from both workouts and to about the same extent but individually the responses varied considerably about a third of the people had failed to show much if any improvement in one of the measures of fitness after three weeks of endurance training similarly about a third had not improved their fitness much with interval training and after each type of workout some participants were found to be in worse shape a majority of the participants in other words had failed to respond as expected after one of the workouts but importantly no one had failed to respond at all every man and woman had measurably improved his or her fitness in some way after one of the sessions if not the other those who had shown little response to endurance training generally showed a robust improvement after the interval sessions and vice versa these data suggest that there is no approach to exercise says brendon gurd an associate professor of kinesiology at queen s university who oversaw the study but it does seem as if there is some size that fits everyone the question is how to determine which form of exercise best fits you the answer dr gurd says is simple trial and error before beginning a new exercise routine he says measure your fitness you can do this by briskly walking up several flights of stairs or quickly stepping onto and off a box three or four times then check your pulse this is your baseline number now start working out walk jog attend interval training or spin classes after about a month dr gurd says repeat the stair or step test your pulse rate should be slower now your workout sessions should also be feeling easier if not you may be a nonresponder to your current exercise routine in that case switch things up dr gurd recommends if you have primarily been walking maybe try sprinting up a few flights of stairs and walking back down which is a simple form of interval training or if you have been exercising with intervals and feeling no fitter perhaps jog for a month or two the message he hopes people will glean from his and other studies of exercise nonresponders is not that you shouldn t bother exercising because exercise might not help you dr gurd says it does help everyone once you find your own best exercise ',\n",
       " 'chicago the appalling video seized the nation s attention this week a group of young people kidnapped bound beat slashed gagged humiliated and threatened to kill a teenager with mental disabilities over nearly three days and laughed about it as they carried out their acts but by far the most unusual thing about the episode advocates for people with disabilities have said was not the abuse itself but the fact that it was recorded violence against people with disabilities is far more common than most people realize advocates have said and frequently goes undetected or is not taken seriously the victim in the attack here an white man suffered from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder prosecutors said in court papers filed on friday the four accused attackers ranging in age from 18 to 24 are black the four appeared on friday in cook county circuit court and judge maria kuriakos ciesil ordered them held without bail the defendants are accused of multiple felonies including hate crimes prosecutors said the victim who was found by the police on tuesday was targeted based on his race and his disability during a facebook video made by one of the defendants another can be heard denouncing white people and at one point a man is heard saying he does not care if the victim is schizophrenic i m wondering as i m hearing this where was the sense of decency judge kuriakos ciesil asked in explaining her denial of bail she added how do you put someone out there who has allegedly committed such horrible offenses against a person people with disabilities are more than twice as likely to be the victims of violent crimes as those without disabilities according to a justice department report based on census bureau surveys and people with mental disabilities are the most likely to be victimized but some advocates claim the disparity is actually much greater saying crimes against those with disabilities are less likely to be pursued by law enforcement they believe people with disabilities may be unable to take part in a survey or go to the police or may have trouble being understood as a result their complaints often are not taken seriously there are probably thousands of other cases just like this one in chicago and in some cases worse that will never see the impact of the justice system because folks don t know about it said rebecca cokley the executive director of the national council on disability a federal agency in a lot of cases with people with disabilities the perpetrators are family members or caretakers so what happens when the person who would have to take you to the police station is your abuser advocates have said the underlying problem is a pervasive attitude conscious or not that people with disabilities are not fully human they pointed to a recent case in idaho where a white high school football player was charged with shoving a coat hanger into the rectum of another teenager who was black and had mental disabilities after having harassed the student and directed racial slurs at him for months though the accused student was 18 at the time of the assault he was sentenced to probation rather than prison we have unfortunately devalued disabled people forever which means we devalue their suffering said curt decker executive director of the national disability rights network a nonprofit advocacy group what we experience all the time is that police prosecutors judges say oh this case is hard it s not worth our trouble this person is hard to understand or they re not credible or they won t stand up to mr decker said that when congress spent years drafting debating and finally voting on hate crimes legislation which passed in 2009 it was a struggle to ensure that it punished crimes singling out people with disabilities as well as bias based on categories like race or sex of the 50 states have hate crimes laws according to the league but 17 of them do not specify people with disabilities as a protected group vilissa thompson an organizer of the harriet tubman collective a coalition of advocates for disabled black people said people are ignorant about the extent of violence against disabled people but what s worse is that there s this kind of misplaced sympathy for the perpetrator especially when it s a parent or caregiver ',\n",
       " 'los angeles to understand how andrew garfield successfully made the leap from to holy man it s helpful to know that when he was 8 his hero was mahatma gandhi and that one of his life goals at the time was to seek out the schoolyard bully and envelop him in a warm embrace he was a brilliant terror kind of like a mr garfield recalled during an interview one warm night in the fall my first impulse was to give him a hug and a kiss and tell him he was all right and that he didn t have to behave that way he paused a few moments later adding of course i became his main target because i saw him so deeply after a few hours of conversation with mr garfield about among other things celebrity toxicity spiritual steadfastness authentic living and god it was evident that mr garfield sees many things deeply this attribute was integral to his landing starring roles in two meaty movies that are receiving awards attention this season the first is mel gibson s hacksaw ridge about desmond t doss a world war ii hero a adventist and conscientious objector who refused to carry weaponry the part has landed mr garfield his second golden globe nomination the other is martin scorsese s silence in which mr garfield plays a jesuit priest sebastien rodrigues on a mission in hostile japan both directors said mr garfield possessed a moral conviction necessary for playing their protagonists each of whom happen to be devout and forced to face down japanese antagonists mr garfield who is 33 said he could not have done hacksaw were it not for the intensive preparation he underwent for silence for the scorsese film which was produced first but released second he spent a year under the tutelage of the jesuit priest and author father james martin praying fasting using a small rented west village apartment as a retreat and undergoing rigorous spiritual exercises i got not only a theological education but a deep spiritually transformative experience mr garfield said his brown eyes blazing with the intensity of a tractor beam lithe and nimble not for nothing was he and as finely tuned as a whippet mr garfield came across as a friendly engaged presence with a crackling intelligence that mr gibson described as through the roof there s something about fasting about being empty enough to allow the spirit in to hear and to listen and to be guided mr garfield said to be with that silent void that chaos in ourselves that s what the character goes through he gets the most profound bliss and joy because he hangs in there with the void with the seeming darkness mr garfield met to chat at the sunset marquis in west hollywood a spot arranged by his publicist even though mr garfield was staying on the city s east side he was in production for the coming noir thriller under the silver lake the marquis is deluxe through the breezeway and over the koi bridge were a clerk s directions to the restaurant and couldn t have been farther from the spartan surroundings mr garfield put himself in to prepare for silence that spiritual work in turn seems to have left mr garfield ever more at odds with the hollywood culture he has resisted even as his star has steadily risen the night before he d attended the governors awards the academy of motion picture arts and sciences annual gala while mr garfield said he marveled at the screened montages of the night s honorary award winners he was painfully aware of the constant inflation and deflation of egos including his own it s a really sick old hollywood kind of patriarchal value system based on commerce and money and who s the hottest and who s going to bring in the big bucks he said i m not saying that an organization like the academy doesn t acknowledge and honor talent it s evident they do but it coexists with the commerce aspect sometimes i feel the tail is wagging the dog and i struggle with that of course the reason mr garfield is getting such plum parts is because he is ascending that hierarchy despite himself born in los angeles to an english mum and an american father mr garfield was raised from toddlerhood in surrey england his family was a loving one he said and his father was jewish and resisted the notion that any one people were chosen mr garfield began acting as a child working his way up from the theater to british television and then feature films he came to international attention in 2010 for his lauded performances in never let me go and the social network but it was his casting as for the amazing 2012 and subsequent romance with his emma stone that catapulted him to a wider fame which he knew was coming and dreaded when he took the peter parker role had always been mr garfield s favorite superhero and he said he adored the character and couldn t say no even though being in such a spotlight made him cringe if i could have kept the mask on the whole time it would have been better because i don t have interest in being known for a character mr garfield said of his time as spidey he also starred in the 2014 sequel i have no interest in being known as a celebrity celebrity is a pretty disgusting word it s part of the brainwashing of the culture part of the false idolatry of those that are only human and i don t want to participate in that the paparazzi had other ideas which mr garfield pushed back against when photographers caught him strolling new york s streets with ms stone the pair hid their faces behind handwritten signs directing readers to charity websites in 2015 when it was announced that another actor would be playing mr garfield found himself relieved he wanted to continue working on himself as an actor which isn t easy in a franchise it s a moneymaking exercise and i don t know if i m criticizing that he said i m trying not to judge that all i knew is that i found it very painful to be a part of in that regard but he had already been spreading his wings in 2012 mr garfield earned a tony nomination for his performance as biff in broadway s death of a salesman starring philip seymour hoffman and directed by mike nichols mr nichols became one of mr garfield s dearest mentors and his death along with mr hoffman s in 2014 i m so lucky i got to brush my soul against him every night mr garfield said left him lastingly bereft the performance was recommended to mr scorsese who was finally getting a passion project three decades in the making off the ground in 2013 while mr garfield was in the middle of the amazing 2 he found himself in mr scorsese s upper west side offices for an audition that would last three hours and leave the director thrilled i felt the film come alive at that point mr scorsese wrote in an email andrew let me know right away that he had to go deep into the role and that it had to take time he had to live it this would involve intensive work with father martin who despite his initial wariness ended up guiding mr garfield through st ignatius loyola s spiritual exercises which often mark the summit of a spiritual journey god drew him into the exercises immediately father martin said at one point marty said i m sorry you won t be with me in taiwan we won t have an expert in jesuit spirituality with us and i said yes you will you ll have andrew the production was in 2015 and shortly after mr garfield returned he read the script for hacksaw ridge it was positioned as a comeback for mr gibson who had been disgraced a decade earlier for drunkenly spewing epithets mr garfield said he read the script wept mr doss had rescued 75 men from a brutal battleground in japan and that any hesitation he might have had vanished after he asked mr gibson about the controversy we talked about everything all about that period in his life and the years since and his sobriety and the work he s done and the healing he s done within himself and those others that he consulted and hurt mr garfield said he s a very loving man a crazy loyal man sensitive and caretaking and he s not drinking and it s a really beautiful beautiful thing as for mr gibson he said mr garfield filled every hope he had the pump was primed mr gibson said over the phone this character needed to be profound down to the bootstraps of his soul after a few months breather once filming wrapped mr garfield quickly went back to work and he s also starring this year in a revival of angels in america in the west end but his very immediate future is being dictated by awards his work in hacksaw also landed a screen actors guild award and the golden globes are sunday jan 8 meaning he ll be back on red carpets schmoozing again a reluctant cog in the hollywood machine ',\n",

       " 'the city s education department plans to close or merge nine schools next year that are part of its turnaround initiative among a group of 22 schools to be closed or merged according to a document obtained by the new york times mayor bill de blasio came into office saying that unlike his predecessor michael r bloomberg he would support struggling schools rather than close them and he initiated the renewal program in 2014 to offer extra money and services for 94 of the city s schools we reject the notion of giving up on any of our schools mr de blasio said at the time instead he said the city would infuse the schools in the program with resources including coaches to help teachers improve their practices new staff members to tackle problems like attendance and social services like dental clinics or counseling he said his administration might still end up closing schools but he suggested that most schools would be given three years to improve the program is now halfway through its third year the department assigned each school a set of benchmarks in areas like attendance graduation rate and for elementary and middle schools performance on state reading and math exams but the schools have shown uneven progress eight schools in the program met all of their targets last year while four schools met none and 17 others met only one or two out of six or seven targets many schools in the program have also seen their enrollment decline as families shun schools labeled failing the city previously decided to close or merge eight renewal schools so the latest round of closings will bring to 17 the number of schools in the program that will no longer be operating at least as before six of the schools will be closed entirely junior high school 162 lola rodriguez de tio which had been singled out by the state as persistently failing and whose closing was previously announced leadership institute a high school junior high school 145 arturo toscanini and monroe academy for visual arts and design all in the bronx and middle school 584 and the essence school also a middle school in brooklyn the schools to be closed are all to be sure in the school year only 8 percent of the students at j h s 145 passed the state reading tests and only 3 percent passed the state s math tests even so it is not clear that they are necessarily the worst among the schools in the program all of the six schools met at least one of the goals assigned by the city last year some are being closed for low enrollment as well the three schools in the program to be merged are the young scholars academy of the bronx a middle school frederick douglass academy iv a high school in brooklyn and automotive high school in brooklyn all three schools already share their buildings with the schools they are being merged into which are not in the renewal program the city is also proposing to merge five other pairs of schools none of which are in the renewal program but many of which have struggled with academic achievement and enrollment the education department declined to comment on the decision to close or merge the schools the bloomberg administration closed many large schools to start new small ones studies have found that many small schools had positive effects on graduation rates and college enrollment but not all the small schools were successful the current city schools chancellor carmen fariña has shown a preference for large schools and has said that some schools were too small to be sustainable all of the closings and mergers will have to be approved by the panel for educational policy a citywide body aaron pallas a professor of sociology and education at columbia university s teachers college said the fact that the city thinks that it needs to do this for six out of the roughly 80 or so left suggests that things are not going as well as they d like at the same time he said if these mergers and closures result in new schools that have a new kind of energy perhaps different staff perhaps a different culture that may be better than trying to continue turning around schools that have been struggling for a very long time ',\n",

       " 'rio de janeiro some of the inmates were beheaded others had their hearts torn from their bodies gang leaders used the blood of their victims to write a nightmarish message of retribution blood is paid for with blood the harrowing scenes on friday from the latest prison riot in brazil in which 31 inmates were killed in the northern state of roraima in the amazon river basin pushed the death toll to 93 in six days of mayhem in penitentiaries around the country the bloodshed has shocked the country and is emerging as the most pressing crisis facing president michel temer whose beleaguered government was already grappling with graft scandals a weak economy and simmering anger over austerity measures the bloodshed is revealing a war between drug gangs a failed prison system and a weak government said rafael alcadipani a scholar who specializes in public security policies at fundação getúlio vargas a leading brazilian university and now the horror is spreading prison violence that has spilled out into neighboring communities has been a perennial problem in brazil in 2006 street fighting between the police and first capital command a gang left almost 200 people dead in são paulo causing chaos in the city of 20 million people the killings in roraima came just days after 56 men were killed in a massacre at a prison in the city of manaus in two different riots at prisons this week in the states of amazonas and paraíba six men were also killed the violence at the monte cristo agricultural penitentiary in boa vista the capital of roraima adds to fears about an intensifying war between drug gangs for control of the cocaine trade in the amazon region in brazil the latest episode is thought to involve fighting between first capital command commonly known by its portuguese initials p c c which has roots in the prisons of são paulo in southeastern brazil and supporters of red command a drug trafficking organization that has long held sway in rio de janeiro the authorities however tried to play down the possibility that warring gangs were to blame the gangs which operate inside prisons as well as on the streets of many brazilian cities are battling for supremacy over the trade in cocaine smuggled into brazil across the porous amazonian frontier from countries like bolivia colombia and peru family of the north an increasingly influential gang in the amazon that has allied itself with red command was responsible for the attack at the prison in manaus massacring dozens of rivals from the p c c gang the attack had been planned for months according to text messages intercepted by intelligence agents mr temer the president has been chided for what some have called a response to the crisis he said nothing for two days about the killings in manaus before calling them a dreadful accident and seeking to deflect blame from public agencies because a private contractor runs the prison there just months after emerging victorious in the battle to impeach his predecessor dilma rousseff mr temer is grappling with calls from some of his own allies to resign in an effort to defend himself he sent a message thursday on twitter listing synonyms for the word accident tragedy loss disaster disgrace and misfortune although the manaus riot has fueled a debate over whether management of some prisons should be handed to private companies the violence in roraima casts scrutiny directly on state officials the boa vista prison which is run by the state has a long history of deadly riots and inmate escapes the prison was built for 700 inmates but currently holds about 1 400 carlos paixão de oliveira a prosecutor in roraima publicly criticized the management of the facility in october when inmates from the p c c gang killed at least 10 rivals from red command mr oliveira suggested at the time that the prison should be demolished and replaced if they want the inmates will carry out a new slaughter in there because no one has control of that prison he said despite the writing in blood on friday proclaiming the supremacy of the p c c the authorities contended that the latest killings did not involve between gangs but a power struggle within the p c c itself or an effort to project power by the gang we ve been on guard about something like this for some time transferring prisoners from red command to other units said uziel castro the top security official in roraima we think this had to do with an internal battle either way the scenes from the roraima penitentiary offered an unsettling reminder of how the bloodshed in the country s prisons is a problem that has been building for decades revealing a system hobbled by corruption overcrowding and mismanagement human rights groups compare the current string of uprisings to the carandiru prison massacre in 1992 in são paulo when the police stormed the facility and killed 111 inmates an appeals court recently voided the convictions of 73 police officers for their participation in the killings the problems in brazil s prisons that led to earlier episodes of carnage have intensified with the growing drug trade security experts say brazil s prison population has swelled this century as the authorities lock up more people on minor drug offenses brazil now has a prison population exceeding half a million with about 40 percent of detainees awaiting trial drug gangs that originated in prisons are expanding their sway and battling one another for territorial control of the trade this war between the criminal factions is worsening said antonio cláudio mariz de oliveira a former security official in são paulo the problem is largely a result of the lack of attention towards the prison system both by the government and the public people only react when there s an episode like this said mr mariz de oliveira then they forget about it until the next one indeed some elected officials have expressed the hardened views held by voters josé melo the governor of amazonas state said there were no saints among the dozens of inmates killed in the state s prisons this week calling the victims murderers rapists or gang members at the same time officials in mr temer s administration have tried to play down the prison crisis the situation is not out of control said justice minister alexandre de moraes ',\n",

around 700 000 euros or 738 000 a year although it was small the experiment stoked a widespread discussion about the future of work namely whether investing in a better balance for employees and treating workers well rather than squeezing them benefits the bottom line for companies and economies the trial showed that there are many benefits of a shorter working day said daniel bernmar the leader of the left party on gothenburg s city council which had pushed for the experiment they include healthier staff a better work environment and lower unemployment but the high price tag and political skepticism about the practicality of a shorter workday was likely to discourage widespread support for taking the concept nationwide the government is avoiding talking about the issue mr bernmar said they re not interested in looking at the bigger picture while a growing number of countries and companies are studying the concept of employee happiness the idea of improving it through shorter work hours has by no means gained broad traction in gothenburg the city council s conservative opposition parties derided the experiment as a utopian folly and sought to kill it citing high costs for taxpayers and arguments that the government should not intrude in the workplace the current government is also not backing a shorter workweek even the handful of progressive political groups aligned with mr bernmar s left party have not made a workday in sweden a priority in their platforms nor have large swedish companies including multinationals active around the world embraced the idea other swedish towns that previously conducted limited experiments with a shorter workweek eventually abandoned the concept citing high costs and flawed implementation a similar model in france has been controversial for more than 15 years ever since a socialist government made a workweek mandatory françois fillon a conservative politician who is considered the to become france s new president in elections this may has vowed to kill it if he wins companies of all sizes in france have complained repeatedly that the short workweek requirement has damaged competitiveness and generated billions in additional costs french unions defend the measure as protecting workers from employers who might otherwise return to more onerous workplace conditions still some large companies are beginning to explore the argument that happy workers may make better more productive employees amazon google and deloitte recently began experiments to compress the week into four days for some employees amazon which has come under fire for encouraging employees to work long hours announced last summer that it would test a workweek for a small group of employees and managers giving them 75 percent of their current pay but leaving them with the same benefits as other workers in the experiment at the gothenburg retirement home employees reported working with greater efficiency and energy when their hours were cut to six from eight a day they called in sick 15 percent less than before and perceived their health to have improved at least 20 percent according to a preliminary review issued last year at a nearby municipal retirement home where a control trial left working conditions unchanged employees reported increased blood pressure and said they perceived no improvement in their health peace of mind or alertness the review showed a final report is scheduled to be released in march the program increased gothenburg s costs by 22 percent mostly to pay for new employees but around 10 percent was offset by reduced costs to the state from people being taken off the unemployment rolls and paying taxes into the system rather than receiving state subsidies mr bernmar said modest experiments are moving ahead in a handful of small towns in sweden mostly in the public health care sector to see if the results from gothenburg can be duplicated this year four additional swedish municipalities are expected to start research programs a small but growing number of private swedish companies mainly technology are also dabbling with the concept following the lead of some established companies including a toyota service center in gothenburg that has successfully operated on a day for more than a decade the bigger issue mr bernmar argues is whether policy makers are willing to explore a connection between human happiness and health and productivity despite arguments that governments have no business in setting happiness as a public policy goal leaders in several countries including italy japan and qatar are increasingly paying attention to the concept the question mr bernmar added was should we work to live not live to work ',\n",
       " 'while many of us weren t paying attention some credit card bonuses became so large that the analysts at bernstein research wondered in november if the industry was afflicted with temporary insanity one particular bit of madness a chase offer that effectively puts 1 500 in your pocket without a lot of effort if you are a relatively big spender is close to ending and many people have just a few more days to take advantage of it but the mere existence of bonuses on top of the points and perks that come with everyday spending raises a number of questions for consumers even if you thought you had had enough of to get the best deals shouldn t you at least grab those 15 bills if you have the means or might the offers actually get better and is it time to bet against the stocks of the maniac bankers who are tossing around offers like this chase today first things first that giant bonus comes from the chase sapphire reserve card here s how it works and don t confuse it with the similarly named preferred card if the bank accepts your application you have three months to spend 4 000 once you do chase hands over 100 000 of its proprietary rewards points then you can trade them for 1 500 worth of travel as long as you book your flights or rooms through chase the card has a 450 annual fee but it gives back 300 of it each year once you purchase at least that amount in travel it also gives out a generous amount of points three per dollar spent on travel and dining plus you can swap points for miles on many airlines if you want to take your chances with seat availability in those reward schemes other perks include access to some airport lounges and a rebate for fees you pay for tsa precheck the expedited security screening or global entry which speeds international returns in cardland any offer this lucrative tends not to last this week chase said it would cut the bonus in half for anyone who applied online after jan 12 or in a branch which isn t possible for people in parts of the country where there are no chase branches after march 12 to be safe the company suggests applying online by jan 11 before it flips the switch the next day why the change of heart on a product chase introduced last summer the company always said the bonus was an introductory offer and the bank s generosity led to a 200 million to 300 million hit to its earnings so the window on a good thing is partly closing so should you take advantage of it while you can my wife and i both have done it and are glad we did it has required some mental energy to channel the right amount of spending away from our current card and track the new bills so we don t end up paying late but there is nothing that focuses the mind quite like feeling that you are beating the system this feeling of superiority may be delusional given the amount of research that suggests that we pay more when we put things on plastic than when we pay with cash but i consider myself above average in this regard as we all probably do another big question does it make sense to stick with the chase card or ditch it after the bonuses clear one useful exercise is to run your spending patterns which your card company s website ought to be able to divide into categories like dining travel and groceries through creditcardtuneup com to compare the results with those of a number of leading rewards cards it s a great tool but the site s operator has its own opinions about how much a chase point is worth versus the starwood points that i collect on my primary american express card your mileage may vary if you say swap chase or starwood points for miles and then redeem them for 10 000 plane tickets to a faraway country think about your goals for the next couple of years and evaluate accordingly in our household we are reserving judgment that is in part because starwood is in the middle of being acquired by marriott which faces the challenging task of combining two loyalty programs without driving away frequent travelers sometime in the next year or so we will find out what it is going to do standard disclaimers apply here as always don t carry a balance since interest charges will generally eat up the value of the rewards and then some also applying for too many cards in a short time could hurt your credit score a bit is the madness catching gordon smith the chief executive of consumer and community banking at chase spent more than 25 years working at american express and it was plainly obvious that the bank was aiming sapphire reserve squarely at the amex platinum card indeed less than two months after the chase card appeared in august amex issued a news release announcing new benefits for platinum card holders here is what it didn t do though offer a bribe to every new customer who wanted one of its cards its standard online offer is currently 40 000 of its own proprietary points which are 10 000 fewer than what chase s new lower bonus will be yes it s hard to compare the value of different reward currencies but these two aren t that far apart and many consumers never make the distinction and assume they are the same anyhow some american express customers have been luckier though card industry bloggers report that the company has sometimes made targeted bonus offers of 100 000 or even 150 000 points leah gerstner an american express spokeswoman noted that the company had been in the premium card market for more than three decades implying that it knew a thing or two about appropriate competitive responses to the latest shiny thing what s worked for us is a mix of targeted bonuses combined with a range of premium benefits and services ms gerstner said she added that the company had issued record levels of new cards while delivering sustainable economics to the company in their report in november the bernstein research analysts dangled the tantalizing possibility that american express might begin some kind of price war throwing its own bonuses and privileges at customers now that chase has lowered its bonus however kevin j st pierre a bernstein managing director thinks the chances of that are low they have inertia on their side with a customer base that is generally satisfied with their product and very satisfied with the service he said so how much do they need to tweak to defend that pity not the poor bankers shareholders and consumers who are determined to be the least profitable customers of thriving generous banks probably shouldn t panic about the ramifications of the banks largess at this point chase would not comment about the performance of sapphire reserve owing to the requirement to stay silent before its coming earnings announcement still it almost certainly modeled the possibility that some people would spend their bonus and then stop using the card the card s profitability will depend largely on what percentage of cardholders carry a balance and how much and for how long mr st pierre said he didn t lose much sleep over a single card offering from a bank of this size they are so large that they can afford to experiment he said a few hundred million in any quarter is a cost of doing business and they ll use it learn from it and improve the product from their perspective and move on citi s own plastic pushers have already done a bit of this its competing prestige card reduced some perks several months back though it kept a hotel benefit our strategic focus is delivering products and experiences that create long lasting relationships said chris fred head of proprietary products for citi s cards unit bonus chasers and card churners it seems are not particularly welcome still the banks face an existential crisis of sorts a generation of young adults grew up on debit cards and banks are going to have to do something to get the millions of them who don t need to carry a balance to switch to credit anyway there aren t a lot of great ways to do it other than throwing bonuses and perks at them the rest of us can keep an eye on the bonus offers via blogs like the points guy and view from the wing or on forums like flyertalk and reddit s pages then when the going gets as good as it s gotten in recent months and we want to go on a free vacation we can sweep in and gleefully pick off the juiciest offers of all ',\n",

       " 'you have probably heard it yourself the impression that millennials are financial freewheelers the theory goes that today s or spend with little regard for savings and even less regard for retiring retirement planning experts say that this assumption isn t entirely accurate though it is perennially true that most young adults don t make retirement savings a financial priority but as the experts point out millennials are in an ideal position to get started because whatever they set aside will grow and accrue interest greatly over time the value of compounding means you ll have to contribute less later said maria bruno a senior investment strategist at vanguard the investment management company she recommends that people open retirement accounts as early as they can that way the savings have more time to build and be reinvested eventually the interest an account accrues will begin to earn interest of its own the new york times spoke to five people in the to age group a small sample of millennial savers two experts from the retirement division of prudential financial offered advice and feedback on each person s profile though advice differed based on the individual situation advisers across the spectrum were consistent on two broader points young investors should take advantage of roth retirement fund options roth funds which include individual retirement accounts and 401 k s differ from traditional retirement accounts in that contributions are made after tax once money is invested earnings and withdrawals are younger workers should contribute at least as much as an employer is willing to match in a 401 k or similar program with this advice in mind read a snapshot of millennials at various stages of retirement planning mr lacasse doesn t see himself jetting off to exotic destinations at the end of his career but he does hope to have some financial security and independence he makes about 52 000 a year and contributes 4 percent of every paycheck to a 403 b account a retirement account primarily for teachers his school does not match his contributions but he did receive an initial contribution of 1 200 he currently has about 6 000 in a savings account he doesn t touch and he puts away a little from every paycheck though he would like to save more mr lacasse worries that he is not in a secure enough position to do so there s kind of a feeling of short term versus long term and unfortunately the short term comes first i need to cover my expenses he said the long term takes a major back seat for one thing student loan repayments of nearly 500 a month represent about a fifth of his monthly expenses and hinder his ability to squirrel away more the advice stephanie sherman a certified financial planner at prudential said that mr lacasse might be able to restructure his student loans to give himself more breathing room if he has a great credit score he can refinance them and make the same payment and pay them off quicker or free up more money for savings she said mr lacasse said he had already considered refinancing and was thinking about it more seriously after hearing ms sherman s advice the process seems so daunting and it keeps getting pushed aside he said now i feel more motivated to do it if she is able to break into theater or film ms craven would like to keep working for a lifetime as an actor i m going to want to tell stories and do that as long as i can she said even so she hopes by her late 60s or early 70s to prioritize family time and traveling though she has never had a job with retirement benefits she would be comfortable putting aside 5 to 10 percent of her 45 000 income on her own she already has 7 500 in savings but not in a formal retirement account her main concern is seasonal fluctuations in her salary that could derail a savings plan i m in a very busy season for work right now so i m making more money but once the tourists go away it ll be back to scraping by ms craven said the advice ms craven said she felt she wasn t doing enough to save for retirement but the experts saw things differently mollie sounds like she has it all together ms sherman said noting how much she already has in savings she didn t deny that seasonal income fluctuations were a challenge but said that there were many ways to plan around them she suggested that ms craven find a financial adviser to develop a personalized strategy and perhaps open an independent retirement account ms sherman also explained that many people in the entertainment field built retirement benefit credits through organizations that they worked for but that these benefits were not always well advertised to contractors ms craven said that she was fairly certain she had not accrued retirement credits through her performances but was interested in finding an adviser and considering a formal retirement account it does seem disheartening that the savings account that i have just sits there and doesn t grow hardly at all maybe a cent every month or so she said i d love to put some of that away and not touch it although he has worked at his current company redwood logistics for more than three years mr ruger has been hesitant to invest in its 401 k it s such a millennial thing but i don t want to have to commit to a job he said his career goal is to wind up on broadway and while he does some singing gigs on the side the older he gets the less likely he figures he is to start a acting career he doesn t have a definite vision for his retirement either if i m being totally honest i never saw myself as having that option mr ruger said he has a few thousand dollars in a checking account but no specific savings he also has a lot of college debt we re paying off these crazy student loans with these crazy interest rates mr ruger said stuff that requires money like houses and cars and retirement are not in the cards we can just pay off the interest on our student loans and our rent and work until we die further on the topic of his company s 401 k mr ruger said he was unsure how the plan worked and worried about losing his investment if he ever left the job the advice crystal vacura a retirement counselor at prudential said that mr ruger s feelings were not uncommon many people are hesitant to invest in a 401 k for reasons like procrastination or confusion she pointed out to mr ruger that 401 k contributions could usually stay invested in the original fund or could roll over into new accounts if he switched employers or went freelance she also suggested that mr ruger put aside all of the earnings from his singing gigs into a dedicated savings account if he is really not comfortable with a 401 k he should consider opening an i r a she said mr ruger particularly liked mrs vacura s suggestion of investing the money he earned from singing and said that if he had to choose between a 401 k and an i r a i d go with getting my act together and opening a retirement account through my job because they offer one and it s ridiculous that i haven t done that yet as a state employee ms king is eligible to invest in the ohio public employees retirement system and she anticipates staying with her employer for the duration i hope to retire at some point my expectation is after 30 years of service she said because i am working for a public institution 30 years is pretty much the standard she has been in her current role for only three years but was able to start contributing to opers the acronym for the ohio retirement system as a student employee and already has 15 000 in her account though she has no other formal savings ms king owns a house and contributes 10 percent of her salary to the account with the university contributing an additional 14 percent ms king is paying off student loans but expects to be by the end of the winter at which point she will be able to diversify her savings plan and increase her contributions by as much as 25 or 50 percent the advice cherita certainly seems on paying off her student loans ms sherman said she also seems very focused on redirecting that to increasing her retirement savings ms sherman and ms vacura agreed that ms king was in a good position for retirement though they recommended that she open a separate rainy day savings account ms king said the rainy day fund was her next priority after paying off her student loans and she was happy her efforts had won good reviews it s validating to hear that people who know about finance are saying i m on the right track she said ms hamilton has been planning for her retirement since she was 17 i took a class in high school and they showed me the building of compounding interest she said that prompted her to get a weekend job and put her earnings into an i r a which has grown to about 30 000 she also has a separate 401 k through her employer with a similar amount invested i want to work really hard now and save really hard so i can travel the world and not have to worry about finances in retirement ms hamilton said her husband is a strong partner in her savings plan when they married last year they agreed to live on a single income and put the rest into savings they already have more than 100 000 ms hamilton is very reluctant to touch her primary income for anything beyond basic necessities when the time came to buy new furniture she got a weekend job at restoration hardware to cover the expense the advice ms sherman of prudential said that while ms hamilton would seem to be a model of thrift she could be even more proactive perhaps by buying life insurance or opening a retirement savings plan really start to address the things that could derail your retirement as you re a fabulous saver she suggested ms hamilton said that her personal financial adviser gave similar feedback and that she was encouraged to be receiving such consistent advice about reaching her goals i may not make a million dollars a year but i feel like i can one day hopefully have a retirement that s comparable she said ',\n",

a team in place as soon as possible i believe all the s cabinet appointments will be confirmed senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky the majority leader said but democrats are calling for the process to be slowed and for the hearings to be spread out that they say would allow more time to vet the nominees our first overarching focus is getting tax returns and ethics forms said senator amy klobuchar democrat of minnesota in a letter to senators chuck schumer of new york and elizabeth warren of massachusetts the leader of the office of government ethics walter m shaub jr said on friday that the announced hearing schedule for several nominees who have not completed the ethics review process is of great concern to me he said the packed schedule had put undue pressure on the office to rush its reviews of the nominees and he knew of no other occasion in the office s four decades when the senate had held a confirmation hearing before the review was completed mr schumer responded on saturday by saying that the letter had made clear that the trump transition team colluded with senate republicans to jam through the nominees several of the nominees are millionaires or billionaires and have vast webs of financial interests that must be untangled the trump transition team issued a statement on saturday evening defending its handling of the nomination process richard w painter a law professor at the university of minnesota who served as chief ethics counsel to president george w bush said he thought none of the nominees could receive a full vote on the senate floor before the

position on them democrats have little chance of blocking any of the nominees having given up the use of the filibuster in such cases when they were in the majority but they say mr trump has handed them ample political ammunition mr sessions is certain to be asked whether he as attorney general would make good on mr trump s pledges to get a special counsel to jail hillary clinton over her email server general kelly can expect questions about whether he favors mr trump s call to build a wall on the mexican border and create a database on muslims mr pompeo is likely to be asked about his views on mr trump s support for waterboarding and his skepticism about the intelligence agencies findings on russian election meddling mr tillerson will probably face a grilling over mr trump s vow to cancel the paris climate accord mr tillerson has spent hours trying to quietly assure lawmakers that he would take a more distant stance than mr trump on the russian president vladimir v putin with

charged accusations derailed his nomination to a federal judgeship senator dianne feinstein of california the top democrat on the judiciary committee said she would press mr sessions to say where he stood on mr trump s pledges to have a special counsel further investigate mrs clinton s emails hillary s situation is done and other than some kind of gross retribution there s no reason for that to even be something to look at ms feinstein said in an interview by posing tough questions said sarah a binder a political scholar at george washington university democrats will try to lure the nominees into inflicting political damage on themselves by adopting some of mr trump s more divisive language she said the terrain was so risky that the nominees might be better served by adopting a stance usually seen only from judicial nominees don t take a position democrats intend to use all the procedural moves available to slow the process on the senate floor possibly spending up to 30 hours per nominee denying mr trump a full cabinet when he takes office republicans are indignant holding up confirmations just for delay s sake is irresponsible and it is dangerous said senator john cornyn republican of texas he added this is a dangerous world we are living in and why in the world would we want to make it even more dangerous just to let our colleagues delay for delay s sake trump

       " 'fort lauderdale fla signs of esteban santiago s unraveling had mounted over the past year but it was not until early november when he walked into an f b i office carrying an ammunition clip leaving a pistol and his infant son in his car to complain about a c i a plot against him that his behavior became disturbing enough to earn him a short stay in a psychiatric hospital unit in the months before the police were called repeatedly to his home about domestic disturbances and the national guard kicked him out because of unsatisfactory performance after nearly a decade of service mr santiago an iraq war veteran increasingly spoke to relatives and associates about voices in his head that were tormenting him then a little before 1 p m friday mr santiago 26 turned up far from his alaska home in terminal 2 of the fort international airport there law enforcement officials said he retrieved his checked luggage pulled a handgun out of his suitcase and used it to kill five people and wound six others setting off a panic that shut down the airport after running out of ammunition he lay on the floor waiting quietly to be arrested witnesses said late saturday afternoon the united states attorney for the southern district of florida announced that mr santiago had been arrested and charged on a federal criminal complaint in connection with the deadly shooting of multiple victims at fort international airport his first court appearance was scheduled for monday morning before a federal magistrate in fort lauderdale law enforcement officials said they had not determined a motive or cause for the attack and while they said they could not exclude the possibility of terrorism the initial investigation suggested that mr santiago had acted alone and that there was no evidence that he had terrorist ties it s way too early for us to really rule out anything george piro the agent in charge of the f b i s miami office said at a news conference here on saturday but family members said they had a pretty good idea of what led to the attack he said he heard certain voices that the u s government wanted to enroll him in certain groups for isis and he was very paranoid bryan santiago ruiz an older brother of mr santiago s said in an interview on saturday in peñuelas the small town in puerto rico where they grew up esteban santiago lived in anchorage and bryan santiago said he had visited him there most recently staying with him from august through october he said that the c i a controlled him through secret messages over the internet and told him the things he had to do he recalled it was on nov 7 that esteban santiago went to the f b i office in anchorage to report that his mind was being controlled by u s intelligence agencies marlin l ritzman the agent in charge of the office said on saturday during the interview mr santiago appeared agitated incoherent and made disjointed statements elaborating a senior law enforcement official said mr santiago had claimed that the c i a put terrorist propaganda on his computer f b i agents called the local police who took him to a psychiatric facility santiago was having terroristic thoughts and believed he was being influenced by isis said christopher tolley the anchorage police chief referring to the islamic state when mr santiago went into the f b i office he left a pistol and his newborn in his vehicle chief tolley said and he had an ammunition clip in his pocket the senior law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case publicly said the gun was the same weapon used in the airport shooting on friday the police confiscated the gun but returned it to mr santiago in december chief tolley said bryan santiago said his brother was held at the hospital for just a few days before being released and as far as he knew did not have any treatment like medication or therapy the fort lauderdale airport reopened on saturday as the f b i led an investigation that sprawled across the country and airport officials tried to reunite people with what they said were 20 000 items that had been recovered from the terminal left behind by passengers and airport workers fleeing for their lives esteban santiago was born in new jersey but was raised in puerto rico where he joined the puerto rico national guard in 2007 before he finished high school a classmate said he had always wanted to be a soldier in 2010 mr santiago was deployed to iraq for nine months working with the 130th engineer battalion clearing roads of improvised explosives and maintaining bridges according to the alaska army national guard his company was awarded the meritorious unit commendation guard officials said at least two members of the company were killed in insurgent attacks during the tour but there is no record indicating that mr santiago was ever involved in combat family members said mr santiago was never quite the same after his return after iraq something happened hernan rivera 70 mr santiago s uncle said saturday afternoon as he stood in his driveway in union city n j when he came back from iraq he was a different person he described his nephew as a normal kid who enjoyed reading he was a person who used to talk a lot mr rivera said and then when he came back he kept to himself he d go to his room he wouldn t talk to anybody in 2014 mr santiago moved to alaska and joined the alaska army national guard he got a job as a security guard and found a girlfriend 14 years his senior a few months ago they had a baby a law enforcement official said it was not clear whether that was the same child that he brought with him to the f b i office in november in january 2016 the girlfriend told the police that mr santiago had flown into a rage while she was using the bathroom broke down the bathroom door and was strangling her and smacking her in the side of the head while screaming at her according to a criminal complaint filed against him a month later he was charged with violating a court order to stay away from his girlfriend after the police found that he had been living with her again in march a deferred judgment was entered in the case meaning that it could be dismissed if he stayed out of trouble but the signs of unrest continued chief tolley said that once in march and twice in october mr santiago was the subject of domestic disturbance calls but each time officers lacked the basis for making an arrest in august mr santiago who had reached the rank of private first class and had won several commendations for his earlier national guard service including the army good conduct medal was discharged by the alaska guard for unsatisfactory performance despite the disturbing nature of the episode with the f b i in november it did not land mr santiago on any law enforcement watch lists or on the federal list neither did it impede his right to possess a gun at a news conference on saturday in anchorage officials with the f b i and local law enforcement said that although mr santiago was clearly incoherent during his encounter with f b i agents he was not deemed to be threatening in two other mass killings perpetrators had drawn attention from the f b i before carrying out their attacks omar mateen who killed 49 people and wounded 53 others at the pulse nightclub in orlando in june had fallen under f b i scrutiny twice for possible ties to terrorism and tamerlan tsarnaev the older of the two brothers who carried out the boston marathon bombing in 2013 was interviewed by agents looking into whether he had extremist tendencies but their investigation of him ended there on thursday night mr santiago boarded a flight in anchorage changed planes in minneapolis on friday morning and flew into fort lauderdale law enforcement officials said that he had a semiautomatic handgun in his checked suitcase and that he followed all legal procedures for transporting the weapon he went into a terminal restroom took out the gun and loaded it then returned to the baggage claim area and started shooting officials said he apparently acted alone agent piro said on saturday and the early indication is that there was no specific reason that he chose fort lauderdale international airport but we re still pursuing that and trying to really determine why he came here the suspect did cooperate with the interview team which agent piro described as a joint effort by the f b i and the broward county sheriff s office the interview went over several hours and concluded sometime this morning while people who knew mr santiago recently saw anger instability and paranoia those who knew him earlier in his life had known someone very different relatives and acquaintances in puerto rico remembered him as being quiet and shy so reserved that in his hometown peñuelas on the island s southwest coast few people knew anything about him workers at the barbershop the bakery and the furniture store and parishioners at the churches near his family s home said they did not know mr santiago or his family at all at the police station officers said they did not recognize him from the photograph that has been shown repeatedly on network and cable television since his arrest a neighbor of the family s carlos cruz a man in his 50s who has lived in the neighborhood his entire life said he remembered speaking with mr santiago just once those who did recall him described him as highly intelligent kind and very quiet part of a somewhat nerdy group who listened to american rock rather than music in spanish he spoke of joining the military seeing it as a way out of the sleepy economically stagnant region rosemarie zapata 27 who attended middle school and high school with him credited him with persuading her to join the puerto rico national guard at first she failed the exam by two points but it was mr santiago who talked her into persevering and introduced her to his recruiter she said he told me study go they will help us pay for college so why don t you try it out she said he convinced her that she could do it saying you are going to defy all odds she recalled years later she ran into him in a walgreens parking lot shortly after he had returned from iraq he was very different she said in a telephone interview from puerto rico he told me you would never want to go to iraq i saw horrible things horrible he was very different he was sad delia candelario who went to josefa vélez bauzá high school with mr santiago said he played basketball with the boys who always followed the teachers orders he was the most peaceful of all of them she said he participated in classes and all that but he was pretty shy another classmate joshua ortiz said mr santiago was so quiet that when word got out that someone from their school had committed a massacre hardly anyone could remember his name mr santiago and his friends were never known to be involved in any problem or any fight during the whole time we were in school mr ortiz said we wonder how could his life have changed so much for this to have happened josé hernández who taught mr santiago history at the school said he was brilliant and did not show any indications of being disturbed it s one of those strange cases there are students who you expect mischief from but not this one ',\n",
       " 'the united states system for taxing businesses is a mess if there s one thing nearly everyone can agree upon it is that the current corporate income tax manages the weird trick of both taxing companies at a higher statutory rate than other advanced countries while collecting less money as a percentage of the overall economy than most of them it is infinitely complicated and it gives companies incentives to borrow too much money and move operations to countries with lower tax rates now the moment for trying to fix all of that appears to have arrived with the house senate and presidency all soon to be in republican hands and with all agreeing that a major tax bill is a top priority some kind of change appears likely to happen and it may turn out to be a very big deal particularly if a tax plan that house republicans proposed last summer becomes the core of new legislation among washington s lobbying shops and policy analysis crowd it s known as a cash flow tax with border adjustment it s easier to think of it as the most substantial reworking of how businesses are taxed since the corporate income tax was introduced a century ago and it could if enacted have big effects not just in the tax departments of major corporations but in global financial markets and the aisles of your local walmart this possible revamping of the corporate tax code is less politically polarizing than the debates sure to unfold in the months ahead over health care or even over individual income taxes but the consequences for business and for the trajectory of the economy are huge the basic idea behind a d b c f t to use the abbreviation that has taken hold in a particularly nerdy corner of twitter is this right now companies are taxed based on their income generated in the united states but there are countless tricks that corporate accountants can play to reduce the income companies report and to reduce their tax burden and those tricks distort the economy two prime examples are transferring intellectual property to overseas holding companies and engaging in corporate inversions that move a company s legal headquarters to a country with lower taxes moreover because interest payments on debt are the current system makes it appealing to take on as much debt as possible even though that can increase the risk of bankruptcy when a downturn comes along the house republicans approach instead of taxing the corporate income goes after a firm s domestic cash flow money that comes in from sales within the united states borders minus money that goes out to pay employees and buy supplies and so forth there s no incentive to play games with overseas companies that exist only to exploit tax differences or to relocate production to countries with lower taxes because you ll be taxed on things you sell in the united states regardless with an income tax one of the key issues is how do you measure income said alan auerbach an economist at the university of california berkeley who is a leading advocate of the idea but with cash flow you just follow the money and the tax mr auerbach argues could spur business investment while not encouraging companies to rely on debt it allows companies to enjoy the tax savings of capital investments immediately rather than depreciating them over time and it doesn t give favorable treatment to debt as opposed to equity that alone would amount to a major shift in the tax system congressional staff members the incoming administration and armies of lobbyists will spend countless hours hammering out the details of any such proposal how it might be phased in and how to treat financial services and much more some of the most complex and politically problematic elements of the plan revolve around its treatment of international trade which creates winners and losers and some of those potential losers are powerful consider what border adjustment means when an american company exports goods under this new tax system it would not pay any taxes on its international sales while its imports would be taxed so a company that spent 80 making something that it sold overseas for 100 would pay no tax on its earnings a company that imported goods worth 80 from abroad and them sold them domestically for 100 would pay tax on the full 100 at first glance this looks as if it would boost exports and reduce the trade deficit indeed it might prove politically promising for advocates of the strategy to pitch the plan as one that would do this many economists think it won t work that way however that s because as soon as a tax with border adjustment looks likely to become law the value of the dollar should rise in currency markets and that stronger dollar could eliminate the apparent effects of the tax the dollar could rise by say 20 to 25 percent and the trade balance could remain about where it started essentially moving to this system means betting on a textbook economic theory as analysts at evercore isi put it becoming a reality even though the effect hasn t been tested in practice if the dollar doesn t strengthen as expected for example industries especially those with lean profit margins could face disaster that helps explain why some of the stiffest opposition to this tax overhaul is coming from the retail industry essentially economists are telling them trust us our models say the currency will adjust and it will all come out in the wash but if the models are wrong for companies like walmart target and many others that sell large volumes of imported goods their viability could be threatened if the models turn out to be right there is a different set of risks the united states dollar is the linchpin of the global financial system and a large move in its value triggered by changes in domestic tax policy could have unforeseen effects many companies worldwide especially banks and especially in emerging markets have debt denominated in dollars which would become more of a burden after a new dollar appreciation a big dollar rise would also effectively shift trillions in wealth from american investments overseas toward global investors with assets in the united states as jared bernstein of the center on budget and policy priorities has noted we don t really know what the distributional consequences of this tax overhaul would be it could increase the costs of imported goods that the poor spend a disproportionate portion of their income on like clothing and gasoline that would be bad news for poorer americans even as it makes the overall economy more efficient there s still a lot of work to be done to understand the consequences of the d b c f t also work to be done to find a catchier name but there s a broader point about the nature of any major policy reform the benefits of a reworked corporate tax code would emerge slowly these disruptions and costs could arrive almost instantly no matter the outcome 2017 will be a fascinating year in which core components of the tax system with economic consequences will be up for grabs ',\n",
       " 'washington as congressional republicans on friday discussed quickly moving ahead with plans for a southern border wall using money included in this year s spending bills donald j trump insisted that mexico would ultimately pay for its construction we re going to get reimbursed mr trump said during a brief telephone interview but i don t want to wait that long but you start and then you get reimbursed the congressional republicans talk led to speculation that mr trump was retreating on his campaign promise to make mexico pay for the wall mr trump insisted he is not republicans have balked at increases in domestic spending during the obama administration and are unlikely to enthusiastically rally behind a proposal that could require billions of taxpayer dollars building a wall to keep out unauthorized immigrants could also face intense opposition from a bipartisan coalition in congress that argues that a vast barrier along the border would be ineffective in stopping people who are determined to enter the country illegally and would represent a symbolic affront to the idea that the united states is a welcoming country that embraces immigration in the interview mr trump vowed that mexico would ultimately reimburse the united states he said that payment would most likely emerge from his efforts to renegotiate the north american free trade agreement with the mexican government it s going to be part of everything mr trump said of the cost of building the wall we are going to be making a much better deal it s a deal that never should have been signed but he said that the trade negotiations would take time and that he supported the idea of using taxpayer money to begin construction of the border wall in order to speed up the process the full cost of a wall as described by mr trump could be enormous attaching such a charged issue to annual mandatory government funding measures could instigate a risky political fight those who want to block money for the wall by holding up the bills could find themselves accused of shutting down the government the government accountability office has estimated it could cost 6 5 million per mile to build a fence with an additional 4 2 million per mile for roads and more fencing according to congressional officials those estimates do not include maintenance of the fence along the nearly border with mexico the chairman and the committee have no interest in threatening a shutdown said jennifer hing a spokeswoman for the house appropriations committee referring to representative rodney frelinghuysen republican of new jersey and the committee s new chairman if funding for the border wall is included in spending bills this spring it would provide money to begin construction on a barrier that was authorized by legislation passed in 2006 but was never completed ms hing said neither mr trump s transition team nor republican leaders had asked for funding to build a wall on the mexican border if and when a proposal is received we will take a careful look at it she said in an email on friday at a rally in august in phoenix hours after meeting with president enrique peña nieto of mexico mr trump vowed that america s southern neighbor would bear the financial burden of securing the border mexico will pay for the wall believe me 100 percent they don t know it yet but they will pay for the wall mr trump said they re great people and great leaders but they will pay for the wall in a twitter post on friday mr trump mocked news reports about the possible taxpayer funding of the border barrier suggesting that mexico would be forced to reimburse the american government for any costs incurred in building the wall the dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the great wall for sake of speed will be paid back by mexico later he wrote early friday vicente fox who was mexico s president from 2000 until 2006 responded to mr trump s twitter message with a barrage of outraged posts that became an internet talking point on their own in one of them he made reference to the intelligence agency reports about russian meddling in the 2016 election sr trump the intelligence report is devastating mr fox said losing election by more than 3m votes and in addition this are you a legitimate president representative chris collins republican of new york and one of mr trump s liaisons on capitol hill said on friday morning that members of his party in congress were eager to get moving on construction of a border wall even if that meant using taxpayer money to finance it in an appearance on the cnn program new day mr collins said it should come as no surprise to anyone that the united states government would have to pay for building the wall of course we have to pay the bills he said we re building the wall as a candidate mr trump s promise to build a wall to keep out immigrants from mexico was one of his most powerful speaking points he often used it at rallies to whip up his supporters and bolster his argument that illegal immigration was damaging the united states his repeated pledge to make mexico pay was in part a way to rebut one of the central criticisms of a border wall that its cost could run into the many billions of dollars democrats slammed the reports that mr trump would ask congress to fund the project if president trump asks congress to approve taxpayer dollars to build a wall which he has always said would not be paid for by u s taxpayers we will carefully review the request to determine if these taxpayer dollars would be better spent on building hospitals to care for our veterans roads and bridges to help taxpayers get to work and for n i h to find cures for cancer senator patrick j leahy of vermont the top democrat on the appropriations committee said in a statement representative nancy pelosi of california the democratic leader said she thought even republicans might balk at spending what she said

       " 'at the salk institute in la jolla calif scientists are trying to get time to run backward biological time that is in the first attempt to reverse aging by reprogramming the genome they have rejuvenated the organs of mice and lengthened their life spans by 30 percent the technique which requires genetic engineering cannot be applied directly to people but the achievement points toward better understanding of human aging and the possibility of rejuvenating human tissues by other means the salk team s discovery reported in the thursday issue of the journal cell is novel and exciting said jan vijg an expert on aging at the albert einstein college of medicine in new york leonard guarente who studies the biology of aging at m i t said this is huge citing the novelty of the finding and the opportunity it creates to slow down if not reverse aging it s a pretty remarkable finding and if it holds up it could be quite important in the history of aging research dr guarente said the finding is based on the heterodox idea that aging is not irreversible and that an animal s biological clock can in principle be wound back to a more youthful state the aging process is clocklike in the sense that a steady accumulation of changes eventually degrades the efficiency of the body s cells in one of the deepest mysteries of biology the clock s hands are always set back to zero at conception however old the parents and their reproductive cells a fertilized egg is free of all marks of age ten years ago the japanese biologist shinya yamanaka amazed researchers by identifying four critical genes that reset the clock of the fertilized egg the four genes are so powerful that they will reprogram even the genome of skin or intestinal cells back to the embryonic state dr yamanaka s method is now routinely used to change adult tissue cells into cells very similar to the embryonic stem cells produced in the first few divisions of a fertilized egg scientists next began to wonder if the four yamanaka genes could be applied not just to cells in glassware but to a whole animal the results were disastrous as two groups of researchers reported in 2013 and 2014 the animals all died some because their adult tissue cells had lost their identity and others from cancer embryonic cells are primed for rapid growth which easily becomes uncontrolled but at the salk institute juan carlos izpisua belmonte had been contemplating a different approach he has long been interested in regeneration the phenomenon in which certain animals like lizards and fish can regenerate lost tails or limbs the cells near the lost appendage revert to a stage midway between an embryonic cell which is open to all fates and an adult cell which is committed to being a particular type of cell before rebuilding the missing limb this partial reprogramming suggested to him that reprogramming is a stepwise process and that a small dose of the yamanaka factors might rejuvenate cells without the total reprogramming that converts cells to the embryonic state with alejandro ocampo and other salk researchers dr izpisua belmonte has spent five years devising ways to deliver a nonlethal dose of yamanaka factors to mice the solution his team developed was to genetically engineer mice with extra copies of the four yamanaka genes and to have the genes activated only when the mice received a certain drug in their drinking water applied just two days a week the salk team worked first with mice that age prematurely so as to get quick results what we saw is that the animal has fewer signs of aging healthier organs and at the end of the experiment we could see they had lived 30 percent longer than control mice dr izpisua belmonte said the team also saw improved organ health in normal mice but because the mice are still living could not yet say if longevity was extended dr izpisua belmonte believes these beneficial effects have been obtained by resetting the clock of the aging process the clock is created by the epigenome the system of proteins that clads the cell s dna and controls which genes are active and which are suppressed when an egg develops into a whole animal the epigenome plays a critical role by letting a heart cell say activate just the genes specific to its role but switching off all the genes used by other types of cells this process lets the embryo s cells differentiate into all the various types of cells required by the adult body the epigenome is also involved throughout life in maintaining each cell and letting it switch genes on and off as required for its housekeeping duties the epigenome itself is controlled by agents that add or subtract chemical groups known as marks to its proteins only in the last few years have biologists come to realize that the state of the epigenome may be a major cause of aging if the epigenome is damaged perhaps by accumulating too many marks the cell s efficiency is degraded dr izpisua belmonte sees the epigenome as being like a manuscript that is continually edited at the end of life there are many marks and it is difficult for the cell to read them he said what the yamanaka genes are doing in his mice he believes is eliminating the extra marks thus reverting the cell to a more youthful state the salk biologists do indeed provide what i believe to be the first evidence that partial reprogramming of the genome ameliorated symptoms of tissue degeneration and improved regenerative capacity dr vijg said but he cautioned the mice used in the study might not be fully representative of ordinary aging dr guarente said it was more likely that the yamanaka genes were not erasing the epigenomic marks directly but rather were activating the genes which are responsible for the immense health and vitality of embryonic cells this gene activation is a natural function of the yamanaka factors it is these embryonic genes that are rejuvenating the tissues in the mice dr guarente suggested and causing changes in the epigenome through their activity thomas a rando an expert on stem cells and aging at stanford said that it should be possible in theory to uncouple the differentiation program and the aging process and that if that s what s happening this is the first demonstration of that dr izpisua belmonte said he was testing drugs to see if he could achieve the same rejuvenation as with the yamanaka factors the use of chemicals will be more translatable to human therapies and clinical applications he said ',\n",
       " 'it s one of the things we are most afraid might happen to us we go to great lengths to avoid it and yet we do it all the same we marry the wrong person partly it s because we have a bewildering array of problems that emerge when we try to get close to others we seem normal only to those who don t know us very well in a wiser more society than our own a standard question on any early dinner date would be and how are you crazy perhaps we have a latent tendency to get furious when someone disagrees with us or can relax only when we are working perhaps we re tricky about intimacy after sex or clam up in response to humiliation nobody s perfect the problem is that before marriage we rarely delve into our complexities whenever casual relationships threaten to reveal our flaws we blame our partners and call it a day as for our friends they don t care enough to do the hard work of enlightening us one of the privileges of being on our own is therefore the sincere impression that we are really quite easy to live with our partners are no more naturally we make a stab at trying to understand them we visit their families we look at their photos we meet their college friends all this contributes to a sense that we ve done our homework we haven t marriage ends up as a hopeful generous infinitely kind gamble taken by two people who don t know yet who they are or who the other might be binding themselves to a future they cannot conceive of and have carefully avoided investigating for most of recorded history people married for logical sorts of reasons because her parcel of land adjoined yours his family had a flourishing business her father was the magistrate in town there was a castle to keep up or both sets of parents subscribed to the same interpretation of a holy text and from such reasonable marriages there flowed loneliness infidelity abuse hardness of heart and screams heard through the nursery doors the marriage of reason was not in hindsight reasonable at all it was often expedient snobbish and exploitative that is why what has replaced it the marriage of feeling has largely been spared the need to account for itself what matters in the marriage of feeling is that two people are drawn to each other by an overwhelming instinct and know in their hearts that it is right indeed the more imprudent a marriage appears perhaps it s been only six months since they met one of them has no job or both are barely out of their teens the safer it can feel recklessness is taken as a counterweight to all the errors of reason that catalyst of misery that accountant s demand the prestige of instinct is the traumatized reaction against too many centuries of unreasonable reason but though we believe ourselves to be seeking happiness in marriage it isn t that simple what we really seek is familiarity which may well complicate any plans we might have had for happiness we are looking to recreate within our adult relationships the feelings we knew so well in childhood the love most of us will have tasted early on was often confused with other more destructive dynamics feelings of wanting to help an adult who was out of control of being deprived of a parent s warmth or scared of his anger of not feeling secure enough to communicate our wishes how logical then that we should as find ourselves rejecting certain candidates for marriage not because they are wrong but because they are too right too balanced mature understanding and reliable given that in our hearts such rightness feels foreign we marry the wrong people because we don t associate being loved with feeling happy we make mistakes too because we are so lonely no one can be in an optimal frame of mind to choose a partner when remaining single feels unbearable we have to be wholly at peace with the prospect of many years of solitude in order to be appropriately picky otherwise we risk loving no longer being single rather more than we love the partner who spared us that fate finally we marry to make a nice feeling permanent we imagine that marriage will help us to bottle the joy we felt when the thought of proposing first came to us perhaps we were in venice on the lagoon in a motorboat with the evening sun throwing glitter across the sea chatting about aspects of our souls no one ever seemed to have grasped before with the prospect of dinner in a risotto place a little later we married to make such sensations permanent but failed to see that there was no solid connection between these feelings and the institution of marriage indeed marriage tends decisively to move us onto another very different and more administrative plane which perhaps unfolds in a suburban house with a long commute and maddening children who kill the passion from which they emerged the only ingredient in common is the partner and that might have been the wrong ingredient to bottle the good news is that it doesn t matter if we find we have married the wrong person we mustn t abandon him or her only the founding romantic idea upon which the western understanding of marriage has been based the last 250 years that a perfect being exists who can meet all our needs and satisfy our every yearning we need to swap the romantic view for a tragic and at points comedic awareness that every human will frustrate anger annoy madden and disappoint us and we will without any malice do the same to them there can be no end to our sense of emptiness and incompleteness but none of this is unusual or grounds for divorce choosing whom to commit ourselves to is merely a case of identifying which particular variety of suffering we would most like to sacrifice ourselves for this philosophy of pessimism offers a solution to a lot of distress and agitation around marriage it might sound odd but pessimism relieves the excessive imaginative pressure that our romantic culture places upon marriage the failure of one particular partner to save us from our grief and melancholy is not an argument against that person and no sign that a union deserves to fail or be upgraded the person who is best suited to us is not the person who shares our every taste he or she doesn t exist but the person who can negotiate differences in taste intelligently the person who is good at disagreement rather than some notional idea of perfect complementarity it is the capacity to tolerate differences with generosity that is the true marker of the not overly wrong person compatibility is an achievement of love it must not be its precondition romanticism has been unhelpful to us it is a harsh philosophy it has made a lot of what we go through in marriage seem exceptional and appalling we end up lonely and convinced that our union with its imperfections is not normal we should learn to accommodate ourselves to wrongness striving always to adopt a more forgiving humorous and kindly perspective on its multiple examples in ourselves and in our partners ',\n",

working at a telemarketing center he spent his free hours smoking pot and drinking at least a pint of hennessy a day he customized the black 2005 nissan altima with special wheel rims and was methodical about keeping the car looking pristine joshua grew up in topeka with his mother judi bergquist and was especially close to his older brother he liked to play practical jokes on those close to him he was so funny his mother said he had severe attention deficit disorder and graduated from an alternative high school problems with social anxiety prompted him to wear a st louis cardinals baseball cap pulled low over his face ms bergquist said joshua began hanging out with what she described as a rougher group of friends after graduating so she sent him to texas to live with her parents he returned to topeka about two years later and found work at a service but persistent money problems forced him to rely on his mother and grandmother the day he died he called me in the late afternoon ms bergquist said he was extremely upset because my mom had shut off his cellphone and he had a car payment to make he d screamed at her a few hours later she said joshua drove slowly by her house but didn t stop it was the last time she saw him alive hours later timothy and joshua met for the first time through a mutual friend the two seemed to hit it off he didn t come off as a person i couldn t get along with i was easy to get along with timothy said i rode around with josh in his car but as the night of april 23 2007 wore on their easy conversation deteriorated into bickering and the two argued loudly while drinking at a bar he said something about one of my friends so i said something about one of his friends said timothy who called someone to pick him up we were going out the door at the same time still arguing i actually opened his car door and then i walk off i just told him to get in the car that s when me and his friend we re arguing now all i see was him pull out a weapon i thought he had a gun he fired eight times and a friend of timothy s fired twice more before they fled the police said joshua was left in the parking lot with four gunshot wounds in the chest one in the left hip two in the buttocks and three in the left hand my was it was better him than me timothy said i didn t believe in fighting i just pulled out my gun i actually ran up to him when i shot him i don t blame alcohol i knew what i was doing i just saw something in his hand joshua was unarmed police said timothy s accomplice was never arrested during pretrial hearings timothy would see ms bergquist in the courtroom and at one court appearance he taunted her i actually took her son s photo and held it up and turned around and that s when i laughed at her he said ms bergquist suffering from memory loss and insomnia panicked every time she saw a tall man the loose description of timothy s accomplice if i saw anybody with that vague description i would just lose it she said finally wanting to avoid a trial ms bergquist agreed to a plea deal in which timothy would receive about 20 years timothy was impassive i didn t care about life i knew that timothy held the answers that i needed i needed reassurance from timothy that the other person was never going to bother me said ms bergquist i needed to feel safe at the same time i needed to know if timothy was working to change his life i didn t want this to happen to anyone else the first step toward a meeting came after a prison official showed timothy an article that ms bergquist had written about joshua ms bergquist also contacted holly chavez the restorative justice coordinator at the kansas department of corrections and asked whether a meeting would be possible timothy was also growing more introspective he was reading the bible as well as a book that included a passage that seemed written for him if you always do what you always did you always get what you always got the solitude of prison forced him to try to figure out who he was i had a lot of time he said you got to deal with a lot of stuff on your own it made me go back and look at the things in my life i became christian i understood forgiveness that i took a life that i can never give back what follows is a discussion of the reactions of timothy and ms bergquist as they worked with ms chavez toward a encounter the

       " 'beijing a few months after lu qiumei gave birth to her daughter in 2012 local officials visited her home and told her that she was required to be fitted with an intrauterine device for more than three decades this was national policy in china the iud was the government s most important tool for limiting couples to one child and almost all new mothers were required to get one ms lu a former advertising executive considered the demand invasive insulting and potentially harmful to her health still like hundreds of millions of chinese women before her she made an appointment with a state gynecologist and had one put in now a year after abandoning the policy the government is hoping to make it up to ms lu and millions of women like her by removing their iuds free of charge but the offer made without even a hint of an apology has provoked incredulous outrage we shouldn t even have had this in the first place and now the government wants to use it as a form of state benefit for people ms lu 36 scoffed in a phone interview from her home in the eastern city of linyi it s like they are slapping themselves in the face while iuds elsewhere can often be removed with the tug of their strings in a doctor s office surgery is usually needed in china because most devices here are designed or altered to be more difficult to extract some with shortened strings and others with no strings at all but many chinese women have chafed at the thought of the government s getting involved yet again in their private lives and for many mothers the offer has come too late for them to consider having a second child it s the equivalent of someone injuring you and then mending the wound said zhang xintian 25 who watched her mother go into surgery two years ago in the eastern province of zhejiang to remove the iud she had worn for more than two decades in china women often have the same iud from soon after childbirth until menopause while popular iuds in the united states are typically deemed effective for up to 10 years those used in china offer birth control for much longer china began demanding that women be fitted with an intrauterine device after they had one child and sterilized after they had two in the early 1980s those who refused risked that their children would be denied access to public schools and health insurance civil servants and state employees who refused lost their jobs from 1980 to 2014 according to official statistics 324 million chinese women were fitted with iuds and 107 million underwent tubal ligations or as is commonly said got their tubes tied local officials were evaluated by their ability to meet targets leading some to order that the procedures as well as abortions be performed by force on women who resisted then last year confronting an aging population and a shrinking work force president xi jinping relegated the policy to the communist party s scrap heap of discarded dogma and without so much as an expression of regret or an admission that it had perhaps made a mistake the party pivoted from punishing couples for having a second child to encouraging them to get on with reproducing to that end an official said at a recent news conference that 18 million women would be eligible for the free removal of iuds in the next three years so they could bear a second child our country provides support in terms of law finance and service systems to ensure citizens access to the free removal of iuds said the official song li of the national health and family planning commission s department of women and children but the reversal the paternalistic attitude the failure to accept any culpability for some it was too much within hours of the news conference the internet was fuming with indignation the mass implantation of iuds amounted to involuntary forced acts of mutilation han haoyue a popular columnist wrote in a post shared nearly 3 000 times on weibo china s version of twitter and now to say they are offering free removal as a service to these tens of millions of women repeatedly broadcasting this on state television as a kind of state benefit they have no shame second to none over the years many chinese women have come to hate the iud which is inserted into the uterus to block fertilization in the novel frog by mo yan the first chinese citizen to win the nobel prize in literature the main character imposes a reign of terror involving the compulsory implantation of iuds and tries to catch women who surreptitiously remove them in mainland china being fitted with an iud is called shang huan a phrase that literally means installing a loop referring to the stainless steel ring that was the state s preferred device for more than a decade despite higher rates of complications the rings were replaced in the by safer and more effective iuds according to gynecologists in china iuds used for chinese women were meant to be left indefinitely with surgery necessary to take them out dr gloria korta a gynecologist at winchester physician associates in massachusetts who toured chinese hospitals as part of a cultural exchange in 2001 said that while there was a risk of infection from having an iud implanted for many years it was small perhaps because of the problems associated with the early model there remains widespread concern in china about the iud s impact on women s health in 2012 the online portal tencent published a lengthy report arguing that many chinese women had experienced serious damage to their mental and physical health from the iud campaign because of rough surgeries and poor hygiene conditions ai xiaoming 63 a prominent documentary filmmaker said many women herself included had never been advised of potential complications and the need for regular checkups after getting an iud she had to have a hysterectomy when surgery to remove her iud was botched in the eyes of the government women are labor units ms ai said when the country needs you to give birth you have to do so and when they don t need you to give birth you don t even before the end of the policy the government allowed some women to remove their iuds if they complained of medical complications others including ms zhang s mother did it without permission paying sympathetic doctors to remove them but wang feng a sociology professor at the university of california irvine who studies the policy said the government appeared to be preparing to remove iuds on a larger scale they were anticipating the numbers how many operations need to be done as if this is another government program he said the government s eagerness appears to be driven in part by growing concern over the economic impact of the nation s plummeting birthrate now one of the lowest in the world according to 2015 data chinese women had 1 05 children on average well below the population replacement rate of more than 2 1 with fewer young people to support larger numbers of retirees in china scholars have warned of a looming demographic crisis but many couples are not interested in having a second child some because of the potential costs others because of their age cao cuihua 35 a restaurant owner in the central province of anhui and the mother of a boy said she did not plan to remove her iud because she and her husband could not afford more children i did think about having a second child but my economic circumstances don t allow it she said this national policy to have two children has come a bit too late yi fuxian a scientist at the university of who studies china s demographics said half of all chinese women eligible to have a second child were 40 or older most people have already lost the ability to give birth dr yi said by email the willingness to have children is already very low so the chinese government s offer of free surgeries will be of no avail it will have little effect on the birthrate mao qun an a spokesman for china s family planning commission defended the offer to remove iuds and said the government would also cover the costs of surgery to reverse tubal ligations and vasectomies such procedures are more complicated and critics say most chinese hospitals are not equipped for them dr dalice marriott a gynecologist at beijing united family hospital said a woman who had an iud for a long time ran the risk of having it embedded in the uterine wall that makes it much more difficult to remove dr marriott said adding that the surgery could result in bleeding infection and injury to the uterus asked about the public outcry over the government s offer to remove iuds mr mao replied we did not deliberately emphasize that it s a government benefit li yinhe a prominent chinese scholar of sex and the family defended the government s approach arguing that population control measures were not targeted against women s rights if the state doesn t engage in this then it s not only a disadvantage for men it also hurts the interests of women she said women giving up their reproductive rights is a sacrifice that is made for the whole chinese society but many women want the government to acknowledge that its original policy was wrong what they ve done to women is inhumane said xu dali 35 a mother of two sons in linyi why did the government force every women then to have an iud at that time why did it not consider the physical harm that has been inflicted on every woman ',\n",

war refugees a resurgent kurdish insurgency and a failed military coup all tied in the eyes of many turks to american negligence or malice or both president recep tayyip erdogan has responded with a furious crackdown on an array of perceived enemies including the news media and has lashed out at what he regards as western complicity while mr erdogan s critics have denounced what they see as a bald usurpation of power that has subverted democracy and polarized the country many turks frightened and uncertain are not complaining they view his authoritarianism as reassuring and angrily reject outsider comments about paranoia and conspiracy theories some are even embracing the advent of donald j trump despite his statements viewing him as a decisive strongman sympathetic to mr erdogan an islamist with little tolerance for those who dispute him in some ways political historians and scholars say what is happening in turkey parallels the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states the 2015 attacks in france and most recently the response to attacks in germany in all of them many citizens were willing to overlook or forsake civil liberties government powers grew fringe groups strengthened and spread intolerance and dissent was regarded with suspicion i think there are a lot of similar tendencies and it leads to in an extreme case what we re seeing in turkey said steven a cook a senior fellow for middle east and african studies at the council on foreign relations in washington still mr cook said it s not that far a leap to go to an extreme can you imagine if the attacks in turkey had happened in the united states on friday hilal kaplan a columnist for daily sabah a newspaper close to the government lashed out at western news coverage including an article in the new york times that has emphasized conspiracy theories coursing through turkish society that the united states is behind terrorism in turkey describing the article as an attempt to condescend and affront rather than reflecting an effort to understand turkey ms kaplan said that turks have good reason to be suspicious of the united states she pointed out that fethullah gulen the cleric and former erdogan ally who many turks believe was behind the coup attempt lives in pennsylvania and that a former c i a official had once vouched for mr gulen on his green card application in addition she called attention to something else the united states has provided military support to a syrian kurdish militia fighting islamic state extremists a militia that turkey considers an ally of the p k k the outlawed kurdish separatist organization regarded as a terrorist enemy in her friday column headlined why turkey is looking forward to trump administration she added do they really need such details if their only wish is to represent the turkish people as paranoid and erdogan as a villain in another parallel to america the turkish government has aggressively exploited tragic events to stoke patriotic feelings and to frame the broader struggle within the country as a fight to secure democracy even if democratic practices are eroded to do so the comparison was not lost on turkish scholars even those critical of mr erdogan who were in the united states when the world trade center and the pentagon were attacked i couldn t believe the extent to which there was a rise in nationalism even among academics said kemal kirisci a senior fellow and director of the turkey project at the brookings institution recalling his own memories of living in america i felt intimidated intellectually almost felt censured after the coup attempt the government moved quickly to memorialize victims and places rived by violence renaming a bridge in istanbul and a square in ankara and changing street names to honor citizens who died defending mr erdogan s government at year s end the prime minister s office delivered packages to foreign correspondents in turkey inside a black velvet box with a silver clasp was a small marble chunk described as rubble from the parliament building in ankara retrieved after an attack was carried out during the coup attempt a note said that the rock is presented to you as a symbol of turkey s devotion to democracy and like american leaders who exhort citizens to maintain daily routines after terrorist attacks the turkish prime minister binali yildirim urged turks this week to carry on our citizens should not change the flow of their normal lives mr yildirim said in a speech if they do it will be serving the purposes of the terror group mr erdogan and his allies see a double standard in the west s reaction to turkey and say that some of the same measures turkey is taking to combat terrorism like resorting to emergency rule have been embraced in the west particularly in france it is this disconnect between how turkey perceives its own experience and the west s reaction to events in turkey that has contributed to turkey pulling away from its nato allies and moving closer to russia in france there is emergency rule for three months and again for three months and lately for six months in total for a year mr erdogan said in september is anyone from around the world asking france why did you declare emergency rule for a year mr erdogan emphasized that the violence turkey has faced is far greater than in countries like france my brothers turkey was the scene of terror incidents so heavy that they cannot be compared with france and more importantly we faced a coup attempt he said from this perspective i believe my country will understand the extension of emergency rule and support it in a speech on friday mr erdogan underscored the deep traumas turkey has suffered in recent years i do not believe any other country exists that went on its way standing upright after living with what we have gone through since 2013 mr erdogan said we became a unique example in history we showed democracy can be protected together with security challenges mr erdogan s supporters say they are especially upset over how the west has reacted to turkey s response to terrorism saying they had expected solidarity not criticism this is an obvious very serious and problematic disrespect against turkey s right to defend itself against terror said mustafa yeneroglu a member of parliament with mr erdogan s islamist justice and development party mr yeneroglu the head of parliament s human rights committee said turkey faced the same conundrum any country faces when traumatized by terrorist acts if there is no security there would be no room to enjoy the liberties he said this situation leads to prioritizing security while answering questions security or liberty this is not only valid for turkey but for all other liberal democracies turkish liberals say they understand the need for extraordinary measures but they make two counter arguments one is that turkey s broad crackdown in putting so many journalists and intellectuals in jail has gone too far and is seemingly unrelated to fighting terrorism another is that even with emergency rule the country has become less safe on the contrary we have faced more attacks more terror said yaman akdeniz a lawyer and professor at bilgi university in istanbul who represents many jailed journalists he continued there is emergency rule in france but there is no other country limiting fundamental rights and freedoms on this scale orhan kemal cengiz a prominent human rights lawyer who was briefly detained after the attempted coup put it this way yes isis is attacking the p k k is attacking there was this coup d état attempt but what is this to do with all these journalists there are over 150 journalists in jail and with every passing day they arrest more and more people marc pierini a visiting scholar at carnegie europe in brussels who was a former european union ambassador to turkey said the purges in the military the courts and the police have paradoxically compromised the country s ability to protect the public mr pierini also took issue with the government s contention that its response to threats has been appropriate as we ve seen after the coup the reaction is way outside of the formal rule of law you started arresting police and gendarmes now writers actors journalists so there is no limit he said when you start pulling

       " 'some of the most fascinating conversations about class anxiety aren t happening on cable news networks these days but on a more unexpected place on television shows like atlanta and insecure which have explored a profound if largely ignored economic issue black downward mobility on the johnson family is led by dre a marketing executive and bow a doctor they have four children in private school and a house in an affluent predominantly white neighborhood in los angeles they took a vacation to disney world estimated to cost more than 20 000 but despite the family s seeming stability is largely about class tension a central dilemma is dre s battle between his financial aspirations and racial authenticity his and his loyalty to his roots one of the best episodes this season jack of all trades opens with dre anthony anderson and bow tracee ellis ross learning of their young twins career test results diane marsai martin might be in a position of power in a political organization while jack miles brown is likely to be a member of a unionized group of skilled laborers despite jack s obvious excitement about and talent for the manual trades his parents become obsessed with redirecting his career trajectory worried that he will be pigeonholed like dre s father pops laurence fishburne in a job for the rest of his life as pop s presence reminds us while dre s parents worked hard to provide him with an education dre did not inherit wealth making his status both new and fragile this is a legitimate worry because more and more members of the middle class are finding themselves in an economic downslide with little hope that the next generation will earn more than the one before in 2015 the pew research center released a report detailing that the number of american households earning a income had reached its lowest point in over 40 years and the gap between the wealth of white and black families has widened to its highest level since 1989 according to a pew report from 2014 black male children raised in households in the late 1970s and early 80s have fallen out of the middle class at particularly higher rates than white male children after becoming adults another pew report found on shows like donald glover s atlanta on fx and issa rae s insecure on hbo both about a group of professionally striving and financially struggling and both along with nominated for golden globes the theme of black downward mobility is put into high relief comedy in the black community is almost always about struggle said mary pattillo author of black picket fences privilege and peril among the black middle class and while exploring class differences is not new for black sitcoms it is important that these themes are reproduced and restaged for each generation the specifics might be different but every generation returns to this theme because the precarity of the black middle class has not disappeared on atlanta we meet earn a princeton dropout who grew up in a family and who works at an airport kiosk he quits that job to manage his cousin an rapper named alfred miles known as paper boi brian tyree henry who has a song on the radio but makes a living as a drug dealer earn s economic instability is exacerbated when his girlfriend and his daughter s mother van zazie beetz loses her job as an elementary schoolteacher because it was the only constant source of income for the family atlanta offers up a realistic portrait of the vulnerability that the black middle class faces today said jessica s welburn a sociologist at the university of iowa who researches downward mobility while the election of the first president gives many a sense of progress racial disparities have also intensified and limited what has typically been a pathway to the middle class for like a college degree or a government job knowing this still try to break through these barriers with obviously mixed results the jacket the season finale of atlanta offers up one of the most pointed critiques of structural racism that i have seen on television this year neither earn s childhood nor his princeton education can protect him from the constraints that he and his friends find themselves under after earn wakes up in a strange house in a strange bed without his jacket we follow him on an increasingly desperate search in increasingly dangerous situations he finally arrives outside the home of the uber driver who has his jacket only to witness him being shot by the police as extraordinary as that trauma might be for most americans the show portrays the sort of everyday violence to which and latinos of various classes are vulnerable if race is intimately tied to class so is gender as ms rae s insecure so poignantly reminds us the main conflict on the series is its female protagonists issa and her best friend molly yvonne orji navigating the muddy waters of millennial dating we first meet issa who works at a nonprofit and her boyfriend lawrence jay ellis on shaky ground despite his georgetown degree lawrence is an entrepreneur unable to finalize his business plan or find a corporate job he settles on working at best buy and later with encouragement from issa sets aside his dream of developing an app to take a gig at a tech and while the season concludes with a breakup their relationship was perhaps doomed from the beginning by his inertia his unemployment and their economic insecurity through molly a lawyer who brilliantly between corporate and colloquial vernacular the show explores how class mobility often differs for women and men after a string of disappointing romantic encounters molly ends up dating jared langston kerman a witty caring guy whom issa jokingly calls because he works at enterprise molly ends their relationship the first of two times after she and her friends find out he did not attend college averil y clarke author of inequalities of love black women and the barriers to romance and family said black women are plagued by a very common racial problem they like most women are encouraged to pursue the script go to college get a good job and get married and have kids she added but when it comes to dating black women s class aspirations are more likely to be unfulfilled than white women their femininity and sense of value more likely to feel under assault historically whether it was the striving of the jeffersons or the fresh prince of or the settings of shows like sanford and son roc or thea class differences have dominated black sitcoms in the era that these three recent shows are all created by kenya barris created might enable them to attend differently to these nuances of lives ms rae said in an interview with vox this isn t a show exclusively about like the struggle of being black instead it s just regular black people living life by setting her show in south los angeles she is able to reveal the spectrum of class diversity as she noted in an interview with the daily beast yes there s poverty there there are gang members there but there s also affluence there s middle class and everybody meshes together likewise mr glover said in an interview with vulture i wanted to show white people you don t know everything about black culture in that same interview he underscores that one key difference is how he depicts class diversity when mr glover heard a suggestion that paper boi live in a traplike home he refused we were like no he s a drug dealer he makes enough money to live in a regular apartment he added there were some things so subtle and black that people had no idea what we were talking about taken together these sitcoms remind us of the centrality of race not just to our conversations but to policies around income inequality that the coming years may yield a hiring freeze on the federal work force the continuing decline of unions and more suffering for both and is no laughing matter but as the adage goes sometimes we simply have to laugh to keep from crying ',\n",
       " 'san francisco in 1949 a life magazine photographer named gjon mili made a pilgrimage to the french riviera to see pablo picasso mili had come up with a way to photograph trails of light and he wanted to shoot picasso drawing in midair with a light pen a process that would leave no trace except on film picasso loved it the result published in life and exhibited at the museum of modern art was picasso s celebrated series of light drawings of bulls and centaurs and the like photographs that captured him in the act of creating the ultimate in ephemeral art picasso is long gone but some 68 years later google has been calling on dozens of artists animators and illustrators with a update of mili s concept a virtual reality setup that enables people to paint with light that actually stays where you put it at least for viewers wearing a vr headset in place of gjon mili are drew skillman and patrick hackett a pair of video game developers turned virtual reality enthusiasts who live in san francisco they were trying to build a chess application one night a couple of years ago when they discovered it had an unexpected side effect as you moved the chess pieces around in virtual space they left trails of light behind sensing that their bug was in fact a feature the two dropped the chess project immediately and hurled themselves at the light trails hoping to develop a tool for drawing in three dimensions in april 2015 seven months after they had cobbled together a rudimentary system they called tilt brush google bought their company for an undisclosed sum which is how mr skillman and mr hackett have come to be ensconced in the company s offices near the downtown waterfront here with google s support tilt brush has attracted a team of developers and evolved into a sophisticated tool for drawing painting even sculpting in space it was released in april as a free to the new htc vive an 800 virtual reality system produced by the taiwanese manufacturer htc in partnership with valve an american video game developer it s on sale as a 30 software package from valve s online store reviewers immediately dubbed it the vive s killer app this is hardly the kind of reception the two inventors were expecting when they started working on it in mr skillman s apartment a studio in south park the little neighborhood that has been a hub for san francisco s digerati since the 1990s not in our wildest dreams said mr skillman a slightly built with a neatly trimmed beard and a modest unassuming manner tilt brush got its name because in its earliest versions you would draw or paint on a surface that could be tilted in any direction in virtual space but because the htc vive includes not just a virtual reality headset but also a pair of controllers and two tracking sensors that map your movement in space the program was revamped to enable you to paint or draw anywhere within a area no surface required one controller serves as a palette with dozens of colors and effects the other acts as a brush or pen to watch someone use it is a bit unnerving since the person appears to be making marks in midair but you can t actually see those but put on a vive headset and step between the sensors yourself as i did in a windowless room in google s new york offices and the illusion of delusion disappears instead you suddenly see what has been produced a phantom creation in three dimensions something you can walk around walk through poke your head inside do everything except touch google s investment in virtual reality pales beside facebook s 2 billion purchase of the vr pioneer oculus still tilt brush is part of a growing effort one that began with the introduction in 2014 of supercheap cardboard headsets that work with smartphones and continues with the recent release of a stunning virtual reality version of google earth as a free download for vive owners over the past year google has invited more than 60 people to try tilt brush and offer feedback and this week the company is unveiling their work and participation you would never want to create an artistic tool with only engineers said mr skillman that s just absurd according to tory voight google s tilt brush program manager those who have joined this program include dustin yellin a brooklyn artist known for his collages encased in layers of glass and jonathan yeo a british painter whose portrait of kevin spacey as the fictional american president francis j underwood was exhibited last year at the smithsonian institution s national portrait gallery jeff koons whose art works have sold at auction for as much as 58 million had early access though he was not part of the artists in residence program bob mankoff roz chast and other cartoonists for the new yorker have also checked it out as has alex hirsch the young animator behind disney s hit television series gravity falls last june mr hirsch posted a sample creation on twitter along with an enthusiastic status update drawing in virtual reality makes you feel like a wizard god but the first to try it was glen keane a figure who in his 37 years at disney had brought the warmth of animation to such characters as ariel in the little mermaid aladdin tarzan and pocahontas when i left disney in 2012 mr keane said recently in his studio a vintage bungalow on a quiet residential street in west hollywood calif i told them it was because i know there s something new coming i don t know what it is but i need to leave to find it he was still looking when he met regina dugan then the leader of google s secretive advanced technology and products group which was experimenting with virtual reality first he partnered with the group to make a virtual reality short called duet a charming piece released in 2014 about two babies growing up that was shortlisted for an academy award duet broke new ground since animation in virtual reality had almost exclusively been but though he d spent a lifetime drawing on paper mr keane had always dreamed of being able to make the paper disappear the goal would be to animate not on paper but in space he said enter tilt brush which mr keane encountered when mr skillman introduced himself at a visual effects conference in san francisco though still in a primitive state it was maturing rapidly and mr keane soon became a convert in september 2015 seven months before its release he previewed its capabilities with step into the page a video the edges of the paper are no longer there he exclaimed in a as he did a loose freehand sketch of ariel in virtual space this is not a flat drawing this is sculptural drawing scott mccloud the graphic artist whose book understanding comics is considered the ultimate guide to the art form got to play with tilt brush when google invited him to its silicon valley headquarters in august i don t mind saying i m a little bit obsessed with this program he said as we sat in his small office in a mall in the los angeles exurb of thousand oaks one thing that appeals to me the most is it s still very early everyone is asking fundamental questions we re still trying to figure out what people are going to use it for i love it when technology is in that stage so what are people going to use it for mr mccloud threw out a few suggestions performance art virtual sculpture industrial prototyping i doodle with it said mr yeo the painter who spoke by telephone from london i describe it as a sketchbook what it won t produce is anything resembling comics as they currently exist in the medium some call flatland for denizens of flatland who have learned to work within the constraints of this can be problematic mr mankoff the cartoon editor at the new yorker came up with some characteristically drawings during the two days he spent using tilt brush with ms chast and other colleagues at google s new york offices but though he professes to have enjoyed the experience he seems unlikely to lead the new yorker out of flatland you ll probably find a sharp divide between older and younger cartoonists he said or it may just not work but that s no reason not to try it one suggestion the new yorker team had cubes and cylinders and other shapes to draw on so you re not starting from zero in space google has since implemented a similar idea other than that mr mankoff offered with a grin the advice i would have for google is more cats you can t go wrong with cats mr keane has a different item on his wish list currently works created in tilt brush are as motionless as a new yorker cartoon they re essentially static and mr keane is an animator to me the thing to conquer is to be able to animate in real time in space he said as i viewed a tilt brush drawing called victory dance in his studio the piece captures a brief moment in time seconds after his daughter s high school choir had won a national championship but it begs to be brought to life just like you have a spatial dimension you ve got to have time as a dimension mr keane continued there s no reason you can t do that i m not smart enough to figure it out but drew is ',\n",
       " 'she skipped almost every class her sophomore year and still maintained perfect attendance the trick was to drop in for the start of third period wait for attendance to be recorded for the day and then leave with a bathroom pass by the time her mother found out about the scheme skylynn vazquez was failing every subject most days saquan bright did not bother to show up at boys and girls high school in brooklyn he chose to roam the streets with his friends but then ms vazquez and mr bright found a school designed for students like them brooklyn high school for leadership and community service in clinton hill which is operated by brooklyn community services one of eight organizations supported by the new york times neediest cases fund leadership one of 57 transfer schools in new york city established to help students struggling in traditional schools has 202 students ages 16 to 21 by the time students reach leadership they have either dropped out of their regular schools or neared that point because of low grades or poor attendance many come from unstable homes living with single parents in shelters and temporary housing and have spent time in the criminal justice system and 82 percent of the students qualify for free lunch because of their family s income the flexible school schedule which allows for free periods enables students to concentrate on courses required to graduate and the school provides an optional paid internship program which is appealing to students some of whom help support their families or who are legally emancipated and support themselves before leadership mr bright could not keep up with the demands at boys and girls high school he struggled to pay attention in class and could not finish tests in time still he was not tested for a learning disability until he was enrolled at leadership now he receives services at leadership and extended time for tests and his grades have improved at her previous school in bushwick ms vazquez purposefully broke the rules she wore hats at school every day even though they were forbidden and each one was taken away there was a point where i didn t have any of my hats she said all 30 of my hats were locked in the dean s office she enrolled at that school midway through her freshman year after moving from florida she recalled skipping classes and darting off to play basketball and video games with a handful of friends most of whom have since dropped out she said we were a bad influence on each other she said if one of us wasn t in the mood to go to class we d all leave we pushed each other to do the wrong thing in march 2014 ms vazquez s mother enraged by the discovery of what her daughter had been doing spoke with administrators at the school who suggested that her daughter enroll at leadership ms vasquez nervous about again switching schools did not want to go but when she arrived she immediately found a support system there classes were small with 20 to 25 students allowing a nurturing learning environment students are on a basis with all the teachers including the principal respect can be calling someone by their last name but sometimes when you call someone by their first name you feel like maybe you re on a different level stacey fischler the school s program director said students have access to advocate counselors who are similar to social workers and help them with issues beyond academics sometimes referring them to mental health services or youth shelters each counselor assigned to 40 to 50 students is tasked to the point of pestering with making sure they all go to school my priority is to make sure you get your education said heather hansen a counselor whether that is going to your house and knocking down your door or calling you like a lunatic all day or bothering your parents that s my goal ms vazquez smiled as she scrolled through those daily morning texts at 6 25 a m on nov 2 rise shine scholars the grind continues two days later at 6 44 a m rise shine tgif i don t think they sleep ms vazquez said laughing it s a very supportive school more than 14 000 students attended transfer schools in new york city as of the school year the latest for which the department of education provided data graduation rates for the schools are much lower than the overall rate for new york city public schools which increased in recent years to 70 5 percent in 2015 although the class of 2015 at leadership had a 5 6 percent graduation rate that rate improves over additional years typical of many transfer schools about a quarter of students graduate within six years according to department of education data despite lower rates the schools are serving students who may have otherwise dropped out never receiving a diploma you re working with a population that can be changed that does need help and doesn t get targeted often ms hansen said you re working with a population that is getting a second chance and it s nice to be able to give that at the end of the day it can be frustrating and taxing but you get to see them walk across the stage and that s the main goal for mr bright graduation day seemed unlikely two years ago in spring 2014 he fell behind again started ditching classes and almost dropped out that august when he was standing on a street corner in a car passed by shots rang out hitting him in the abdomen members of his family and of the leadership staff surrounded his hospital bed there s a lot of love there he said he returned to school with renewed commitment the leadership family also kept ms vazquez in school i have good friends and a good support system when i get to school every morning she said i didn t think i d get this far but now i see a difference in myself in how i react and how i say and do things i ve become a totally different person and a lot of it comes from this school both mr bright and ms vazquez are looking forward to graduation mr bright who will turn 22 this month is allowed to finish this school year before he ages out of the public school system he needs to pass one more regents exam for algebra his most dreaded subject so brooklyn community services has allocated 500 in neediest cases funds to provide him with tutoring more than of leadership students including mr bright and ms vazquez participate in an program they have paid internships at places including burlington coat factory child care centers and the brooklyn veterinary group last semester ms vazquez 20 received an internship at 3 black cats café and cakery in brooklyn where she worked in the kitchen it was the first job ms vazquez said that she took pride in to bake something from scratch and perfect it she said knowing that it represents your work that is new for me the internship ended in november but she hopes to work at another restaurant her love for cooking started in her grandmother s kitchen they followed traditional puerto rican recipes including pasteles a dish of plantains meat and olives now she cooks to remember her grandmother who died last spring after graduation in march she hopes to continue her passion and has applied to culinary schools in upstate new

       " 'washington russian warplanes have carried out airstrikes to support turkey s offensive in northern syria against the islamic state an important evolution in a budding partnership the deepening ties threaten to marginalize the united states in the struggle to shape syria s ultimate fate the air missions which took place for about a week near the strategically important town of al bab represent the kremlin s first use of its military might to help the turks in their fight against the militant group the russians seized an opening to try to build a military relationship with turkey a nato member as the united states has sought to keep the emphasis on taking raqqa the islamic state s capital the russian bombing is a remarkable turnabout from november 2015 when a turkish fighter jet shot down a russian attack plane that had violated turkey s airspace russia and turkey had already been involved in a joint effort to establish a in syria one that does not involve the united states at the same time ties between the united states and turkey have come under growing strain as the turkish president recep tayyip erdogan has become increasingly alarmed about the kurdish forces known as the y p g the united states has aligned itself with those forces to combat the islamic state in syria some analysts say russia appears to have arrived at an accommodation in which the turks are moving to establish a security zone in northern syria to preclude syrian kurds from setting up an autonomous region in return the turks appear to be backing off their efforts to unseat president bashar of syria who with russian help is strengthening his hold on the country s major cities to the south the rapprochement is largely tactical said james f jeffrey a former united states ambassador to turkey russia can live for now with a turkish enclave in northern syria if it does not threaten the assad regime and it allows russia to exploit the u s shift to turkey s rival the y p g by providing air support to the turks against the islamic state which the u s inexplicably is not providing donald j trump has spoken positively though in vague terms about the possibility of cooperating with russia in the fight against the islamic state also known as isis or isil but the obama administration s efforts to forge a common political and military strategy with the kremlin on syria collapsed after russia supported syrian forces and fighters with its air power in the brutal retaking of aleppo turkey began the operation at al bab east of aleppo without coordinating with the united states and without the benefit of american airstrikes this is something that they ve decided to do independently col john dorrian the spokesman for the operation against the islamic state said in november turkey appeared to have assumed that it would make short work of the islamic state fighters there but the fighting has been stiff in late november the turkish military s problems were compounded when three of its soldiers were killed in what turkish forces said was a syrian airstrike mr erdogan later spoke by phone with vladimir v putin the russian president who assured him that russia had not been involved in the air attack according to turkish news reports the improving ties between the two autocratic leaders opened the door to greater cooperation the turkish military spoke publicly about the russian role in a jan 2 statement that noted that russian warplanes had struck targets the previous day about five miles south of al bab american officials who asked not to be identified because they were discussing intelligence said that russian airstrikes in the al bab area began at the end of december and that russian aircraft were flying near al bab as recently as friday the effectiveness of the russian air operations which have mainly involved dropping dumb or unguided bombs is unclear as turkey s casualties have mounted in the al bab operation turkish officials have complained about the lack of american air support and have even made veiled threats that turkey might suspend allied combat flights against the islamic state in iraq and syria from its major base at incirlik which would be a major blow to the air campaign american officials suggested that the holdup in carrying out allied airstrikes in recent weeks was related to a turkish decision to ban the americans from flying reconnaissance drones in and around al bab to help identify and confirm targets as well as bad weather the turkish military said that measure was needed to ensure that no potentially hostile aircraft flew over its troops but it has hampered the united states ability to carry out airstrikes without endangering civilians operating without the benefit of precise intelligence the united states recently engaged in what officials called a show of force operation in which american aircraft flew low over al bab and dropped flares but last week the turks agreed that the united states could fly drones and other aircraft to gather intelligence which paves the way for the coalition to carry out airstrikes against the islamic state in al bab american officials said the united states regards the kurdish forces as some of the most effective fighters in the campaign against the islamic state in syria but in deference to turkish sensitivities the americans have declined to arm them directly the turks however regard them as nothing more than an arm of the kurdistan workers party an insurgent kurdish group in turkey and iraq the turks have blamed the group for killing dozens of turkish security forces in recent weeks by any measure the nascent cooperation between russia and turkey is a striking development the situation was far different when russian warplanes arrived at latakia syria in september 2015 to help the assad government take on rebel groups including some backed by the united states and turkey relations were thrown into a crisis after a turkish fighter jet shot down a russian attack plane and the russian pilot was fatally shot by syrian rebels as he was parachuting down mr putin denounced the as a stab in the back russia responded by deploying the an advanced system at latakia and imposed economic sanctions against turkey but over the past year the calculations of the two countries have changed while president obama warned that syria would become a russian military quagmire the russians working with iran forces and the syrian military helped mr assad take back aleppo in the waning months of the obama administration without substantial russian casualties still russia has to reckon with the fact that the syrian military lacks the troops to control all of the country at the same time turkey s immediate objectives have shifted worried about the possibility that kurdish fighters might link up separate cantons to establish an autonomous enclave across northern syria as well as about the presence of islamic state fighters near its borders turkey sent its own forces into northern syria in august the turkish offensive which has enlisted the support of syrian opposition groups that turkey has backed succeeded in taking the town of jarabulus but it has become bogged down near al bab the last major town west of raqqa still held by the islamic state the russians notified the united states about the flights using a special hotline between russian forces in syria and the american air war command at al udeid air base in qatar the hotline s goal is to deconflict air missions carried out by the russians and the

       " 'at first blush there s a baffling quality to julian assange s latest star turn in our shambolic national story he belongs in jail for waging his war against the united states by exposing its secrets the conservative fox news host sean hannity has said of him an operative with blood on his hands sarah palin once called him yet last week brought the sight of mr hannity speaking with mr assange in glowing terms about what drives him to expose government and media corruption through clinton campaign hacks that american intelligence has attributed to russia and ms palin hailed him as a great truth teller even apologizing for previous unpleasantries cue sound of needle sliding across record album o k the fact that wikileaks splash was bad for the democrats and good for donald j trump may have a bit to do with their change of heart but what s up with mr assange who seems equally comfortable being a hero of the american left as he is being one of the american right or even of russian putinists what does he want anyway the answer has been in front of us all along and the current imbroglio over russia wikileaks and their role in mr trump s victory or more to the point hillary clinton s loss might be viewed as the realization of the vision mr assange had when he started wikileaks over a decade ago mr assange spelled it out in prescient terms in an essay he posted online in november of 2006 the year of wikileaks founding he wrote it long before becoming the polarizing figure he is today a cypherpunk folk hero with an outsize reputation for being messianic impetuous and all too cavalier with the personal data that come his way he s currently living in the ecuadorean embassy in london where he was granted asylum from swedish authorities who are investigating a rape accusation against him that he says is false and politically motivated yet even his toughest critics acknowledge how clearly he saw the politically disruptive potential of technology back when some of us were getting our first blackberries it s what prompted him to start wikileaks which pioneered something extremely important and very dangerous to large organizations that keep lots of secrets digitally as the journalist glenn greenwald told me in an interview last week from the start mr assange said wikileaks prime directive was to expose hidden data sets that reveal illegal or immoral behavior in government and big business but in the essay he also wrote in more ambitious terms about forcing regime change through data and technology rather than through the old barbaric means of assassination as mr assange saw it power was held by vast networks of conspirators who shared vital information in secret giving them a superior understanding of reality that enabled them to hold on to power the technology revolution he wrote was providing the conspirators with the means to achieve what he called an even higher total conspiratorial power but it was also making them more vulnerable to sabotage so that a governing conspiracy could be slowed until it falls stupefied unable to comprehend and control the forces in its environment as an example he pointed to two closely balanced and broadly conspiratorial power groupings the democratic and the republican parties in the united states consider what would happen if one of these parties gave up their mobile phones fax and email correspondence let alone the computer systems he wrote they would immediately fall into an organizational stupor and lose to the other the essay got new attention when wikileaks working in tandem with the guardian the new york times and other outlets released extensive diplomatic cables in 2010 making wikileaks more of a household name no one seemed to grasp what mr assange was hinting at more clearly than the conservative writer john sexton who foresaw the events of 2016 in a post that was published on breitbart news and his own blogin 2010 you can take his example further by imagining what would happen to say the d n c if it suffered a massive wikileak of secret data mr sexton wrote referring to mr assange s essay it seems entirely possible that a leak of the contents of their email for one month would be exceedingly damaging to them and here we are over six years later mr assange s essay has resurfaced yet again after major data breaches of the email accounts of the democratic national committee and the clinton adviser john podesta committed allegedly by hackers and fed to the world via wikileaks clinton aides have said the breach impeded their ability to communicate electronically afterward causing them to resort to holding more meetings but far more damaging were the spilled secrets they forced the resignations of the democratic national committee chairwoman debbie and of the interim chair donna brazile from her analyst job at cnn and they provided mr trump with a steady stream of fresh data points which wikileaks fed out incrementally creating a running story that the american news media voraciously seized upon political scientists will debate for years to come how decisive the leaks were in the election outcome but the emails were undeniably in the mix of an election decided by fewer than 100 000 votes in three key swing states so in the end one political party was technologically compromised in a way the other wasn t and that party did indeed lose to the other it s a straight line from mr assange s initial essay but if wikileaks disclosures abetted mr trump how does that square with mr assange s goals to undercut authoritarian conspirators and create incentives for more humane forms of governance mr trump was less transparent than mrs clinton was during the campaign we re still waiting for those tax returns and he made a number of statements lock her up that were unique to modern american politics a wikileaks journalist sarah harrison recently wrote in the times that wikileaks was a news organization committed to disclosing vital information not picking political sides mr assange addressed the question differently in an interview last month with the italian journalist stefania maurizi of la repubblica hillary clinton s election would have been a consolidation of power in the existing ruling class of the united states he said mr trump and his allies he said do not by themselves form an existing structure so it is a weak structure which is displacing and destabilizing the central power network within d c that he said could herald change both good and bad a weak power network in washington of course is just what president vladimir v putin of russia wanted to see too given russia s own authoritarianism and opacity try independent journalism there if you dare it s a wonder and for some cause for suspicion that it s not a bigger wikileaks target mr assange told repubblica that while he had released plenty of documents wikileaks has no staff members who speak russian and he told my times colleagues jo becker steven erlanger and eric schmitt last summer that russia was a bit player on the world stage compared with the united states and china their article showed how wikileaks releases often benefited russia at the expense of the west despite american assessments that it is likely not directly tied to russian intelligence services though mr assange does not as a rule reveal sources he has repeatedly said he is confident that the clinton campaign and d n c email caches that wikileaks received did not come from a state party he maintains that the united states has failed to offer conclusive proof of the russian government s direct role and he is not alone on friday the intercept a news outlet by mr greenwald who led the guardian team that shared a pulitzer prize in 2014 with the washington post for coverage of edward snowden s revelations on mass surveillance declared the intelligence report underwhelming mr greenwald has been highly critical of mainstream news reports that in his view have been too quick to accept intelligence reports pointing to russia s role that has added to the fun house mirror aspect of the latest assange turn given that mr greenwald s past work was celebrated by people who are so solidly opposed to mr trump now but mr greenwald has long criticized mainstream american journalists as being too credulous with government intelligence claims see weapons of mass destruction unlike perhaps mr hannity and ms palin he is being consistent what s changed is the political earth around me he said and the same thing has happened to julian that earth is still shifting where mr assange turns up on it next is anyone s guess ',\n",
       " 'wealth and influence in the technology business have always been about gaining the upper hand in software or the machines that software ran on now data gathered in those immense pools of information that are at the heart of everything from artificial intelligence to online shopping recommendations is increasingly a focus of technology competition and academics and some policy makers especially in europe are considering whether big internet companies like google and facebook might use their data resources as a barrier to new entrants and innovation in recent years google facebook apple amazon and microsoft have all been targets of tax evasion privacy or antitrust investigations but in the coming years who controls what data could be the next worldwide regulatory focus as governments strain to understand and sometimes rein in american tech giants the european commission and the british house of lords both issued reports last year on digital platform companies that highlighted the essential role that data collection analysis and distribution play in creating and shaping markets and the organization for economic cooperation and development held a meeting in november to explore the subject big data bringing competition policy to the digital era as government regulators dig into this new era of data competition they may find that standard antitrust arguments are not so easy to make using more and more data to improve a service for users and more accurately target ads for merchants is a clear benefit for example and higher prices for consumers are not present with free internet services you certainly don t want to punish companies because of what they might do said annabelle gawer a professor of the digital economy at the university of surrey in england who made a presentation at the organization for economic cooperation and development meeting but you do need to be vigilant it s clear that enormous power is in the hands of a few companies maurice stucke a former justice department antitrust official and a professor at the university of tennessee college of law who also spoke at the gathering said one danger was that consumers might be afforded less privacy than they would choose in a more competitive market the competition concerns echo those that gradually emerged in the 1990s about software and microsoft the worry is that as the big internet companies attract more users and advertisers and gather more data a powerful network effect effectively prevents users and advertisers from moving away from a dominant digital platform like google in search or facebook in consumer social networks evidence of the rising importance of data can be seen from the frontiers of artificial intelligence to mainstream business software and certain data sets can be remarkably valuable for companies working on those technologies a prime example is microsoft s purchase of linkedin the business social network for 26 2 billion last year linkedin has about 467 million members and it houses their profiles and maps their connections microsoft is betting linkedin combined with data on how hundreds of millions of workers use its office 365 online software and consumer data from search behavior on bing will power a set of insights that we think is unprecedented said james phillips vice president for business applications at microsoft in an email to employees satya nadella microsoft s chief executive described the linkedin deal as a linchpin in the company s goal to reinvent productivity and business processes and to become the digital marketplace that defines how people find jobs build skills sell market and get work done ibm has also bet heavily on data for its future its acquisitions have tended to be in specific industries like its 2 6 billion purchase last year of truven health which has data on the cost and treatment of more than 200 million patients or in specialized data sets useful across several industries like its 2 billion acquisition of the digital assets of the weather company ibm estimates that 70 percent of the world s data is not out on the public web but in private databases often to protect privacy or trade secrets ibm s strategy is to take the data it has acquired add customer data and use that to train its watson artificial intelligence software to pursue such tasks as helping medical researchers discover novel disease therapies or flagging suspect financial transactions for independent auditors our focus is mainly on nonpublic data sets and extending that advantage for clients in business and science said david kenny senior vice president for ibm s watson and cloud businesses at google the company s drive into business software is fueled by data building on years of work done on its search and other consumer services and its recent advances in image identification speech recognition and language translation for example a new google business offering still in the test or alpha stage is a software service to improve job finding and recruiting its data includes more than 17 million online job postings and the public profiles and résumés of more than 200 million people its algorithms distilled that to about four million unique job titles ranked the most common ones and identified specific skills the job sites careerbuilder and dice are using the google technology to show job seekers more relevant openings and fedex the giant package shipper is adding the service to its recruiting site that is just one case said diane greene senior vice president for google s cloud business of what is becoming increasingly possible using the tools of artificial intelligence notably machine learning to sift through huge quantities of data to provide data services you can turn this technology to whatever field you want from manufacturing to medicine ms greene said li director of the stanford artificial intelligence laboratory is taking a sabbatical to become chief scientist for artificial intelligence at google s cloud unit she sees working at google as one path to pursue her career ambition to democratize a i now that the software

       " 'as the dust settles on russian interference in the united states election journalists are confronting an aspect that has received less scrutiny than the hacking itself but poses its own thorny questions moscow s ability to steer western media coverage by doling out hacked documents reporters have always relied on sources who provide critical information for reasons the duty tricky but familiar is to publicize information that serves the public interest without falling prey to the source s agenda but in this case the source was russia s military intelligence agency the g r u operating through shadowy fronts who worked to mask that fact and its agenda was to undermine the american presidential election by releasing documents that would tarnish hillary clinton and other american political figures but whose news value compelled coverage moscow exploited the very openness that is the basis of a free press its tactics have evolved with each such operation some of which are still unfolding thomas rid a professor of security studies at king s college london who is tracking the russian influence campaign said it goes well beyond hacking it s political engineering social engineering on a strategic level great powers have long meddled in one another s affairs but russia throughout 2016 developed a previously unseen tactic setting up fronts to seed into the press documents it had obtained by hacking doing public relations work in order to get the hacked material out as an exclusive story with the daily caller or gawker or the smoking gun that is new mr rid said that public relations work was initially done by two web presences that appeared this summer guccifer 2 0 and dcleaks each posing as in the mold of julian assange the wikileaks chief though neither acknowledged it and the links were not immediately known online security experts later concluded that both were russian fronts guccifer 2 0 claimed to be a romanian freedom fighter who had hacked the democratic national committee using twitter s private message service the account conducted weekslong exchanges with journalists pointing them to certain documents that had been hacked from the d n c and other targets whoever is doing this understands media they understand the way that media works and how to manipulate media said sheera frenkel a buzzfeed news reporter who interacted with the fronts throughout the summer dcleaks established separately and with its own sets of hacked documents claimed to be launched by the american hacktivists who respect and appreciate freedom of speech the fronts sold the act by peppering their messages with slang and emojis when ms frenkel asked guccifer whether it would release more d n c documents the reply came yeah baby journalists who interacted with the accounts say their tone and facility with english varied widely suggesting each was run by multiple users a reporter with motherboard a technology site quizzed guccifer on the technical aspects of the hacking and on rudimentary romanian guccifer failed both lending credence to theories that it was a front those suspicions were initially restricted to security experts trickling out only after firms such as threatconnect were able to unmask the fronts in detailed reports in july for instance dcleaks published emails belonging to retired air force gen philip breedlove the intercept a site covered the emails in a story that portrayed mr breedlove as trying to foment hostility against russia the story did not note russian links to the hack its lead author lee fang said he had no interactions with dcleaks and pointed out that the group s suspected russian ties were not widely publicized at that time some reporters were offered documents exclusively a familiar tactic of government press offices and public relations firms that want to shape coverage in september dcleaks contacted peter hasson a reporter at the daily caller a site with an offer access to hacked emails belonging to colin powell the former secretary of state the daily caller s story also did not note the growing belief that the documents had been hacked by russia and leaked as part of an influence operation mr hasson said he was unaware of the alleged russian links at the time after awareness grew the front organizations dropped the pretense the newest group called itself fancy bears hack team a breathtakingly overt reference to fancy bear the name that some western security groups use for g r u hackers tom cheshire a reporter with the british network sky news who has dealt with fancy bears said they behaved almost more like a p r firm really and were very businesslike doling out scoops and trying to shape coverage it s the sort of horse trading you do with all sorts of sources really mr cheshire said hitting on a key to the operation s impact the way that it played within the bounds of established journalistic norms any leak by any source russian agent or citizen poses a similar set of quandaries for reporters do you emphasize the hacking itself in your coverage knowing that this will undercut the source s agenda but could also be a disservice to readers by putting less focus on newsworthy information in the release do you withhold newsworthy documents even only temporarily to check their veracity and provenance what if they have already been reported by other outlets that were shown the documents first if they did turn out to be hacked as part of a hostile foreign operation does that really make their contents less newsworthy these are old questions for journalists but they have taken on new urgency with the scale of russia s hackings and aims though the calculus of reporting on leaks may be familiar one aspect of the russian operation stands out the lengths to which the fronts go to mask their identities and motives because the internet gives any outlet the potential to reach millions all it takes is one leak to send the document flying across the web last year hackers infiltrated the united states agency most likely in retaliation for accusations of doping among russia s olympic athletes but fancy bears struggled to place the stolen documents with american or british outlets reporters who saw the files said their news value did not outweigh the risk of serving russian interests when fancy bears offered the files to the associated press the reporters instead published a story on the group itself fancy bears ultimately persuaded sportswriters with spiegel a prominent german outlet to report on emails that appeared to show american athletes requesting medical exceptions to take restricted drugs the article noted a possible russian link only in the final lines alongside a quote from an american official arguing that the leak was intended to distract from doping if mainstream outlets pass on a hacking fronts can always pass the documents to peripheral outfits who will lend them less weight but can still send them across social media that has often included the website infowars which was founded by the radio host alex jones and often publishes conspiracy theories guccifer 2 0 approached mikael thalen a writer for infowars with d n c documents that showed democrats plans for attacking paul manafort a campaign manager to donald j trump who had worked on behalf of the ukrainian president viktor yanukovych a kremlin ally mr thalen had come to believe after many interactions with the front groups that they would reach out based on who would best carry the story the way they wanted it carried he feared that moscow was hoping infowars by publishing the files would muddy the water around accusations against mr manafort indirectly aiding mr trump s campaign breaking with infowars usual reliance on such files he declined to publish the documents because everyone has secrets even if it s only a few embarrassing personal emails and because no network is impenetrable skilled hackers can dig up compromising material on virtually any target democracies which give privilege to competitive politics and free media are particularly susceptible an open society is by choice more vulnerable than a closed society to some form of influence operation said mr rid that is why we re strong but it s also why we re weak the more that journalists and readers understand the motivations of foreign government leakers he argued the better they will be able to place those leaks in context undercutting the hackers agenda without hiding newsworthy information he compared this to a healthy body developing antibodies against a disease foreign influence operations that cannot be wholly immunized against while maintaining democratic openness still some media trends polarization fake news the nature of social media cut against those hopes this polarized election presented itself as a target of opportunity of the first order mr rid said reporters may at times be hindered by a lack of transparency between media organizations which are often highly competitive and prize speed and scoops this has left reporters vulnerable because they cannot easily pool lessons on spotting foreign operations or say warn one another that a certain front is exaggerating the newsworthiness of its latest leak the more light shone on this the more information you have when dealing with a source the better decisions you re going to make mr cheshire said mr thalen the infowars reporter said he was increasingly turning down leaks that he knows his audience would read avidly and reward with acclaim but that he considered exaggerated to advance russian interests still he was unsure it had made much difference a lot of people have swayed their reporting with their biases and i didn t want to do that he said people are believing what they want to be true ',\n",
       " 'covington la sour grapes explained bob marino 79 weighing in on the recent spycraft bombshell from the corner table of a local mcdonald s sour grapes agreed roger noel 65 sitting next to him bunch of crybabies reed guidry 64 offered from across the table the subject of conversation was the report released by united states intelligence chiefs on friday informing donald j trump of their unanimous conclusion that president vladimir v putin of russia ordered an extensive but covert cyberoperation to help mr trump win the election the russians had hacked and leaked emails unleashed trolls on social media and used their propaganda machine to spread stories harmful to hillary clinton in washington the report was viewed as extraordinary both for its timing raising sharp questions about the s legitimacy on the verge of his taking office and for its assertions describing the operation as russia s boldest effort yet to meddle with american elections to spread discontent and to undermine the u s democratic order but interviews with trump supporters here in louisiana a state the won by 20 points and in indiana a state he won by nearly the same margin found opinions about the report that ranged from general indifference to outright derision from the parts of the report i ve seen said rob maness a retired air force colonel who twice ran for senate here as tea party favorite it seems silly there are genuine concerns about russia s cyberoperations he said but the notion that they changed the outcome of the election was absurd the report made no determination on how they affected the election of the comments he had seen from fellow trump supporters on facebook and in emails he added 90 percent of them are like what s the big deal the russians may have very well gotten involved several people said they added that kind of interference should be combated but many assumed that foreign actors had long tried to play favorites in american elections and that the united states had done the same in other countries elections even if the russians did do it which some were more willing to concede than others what difference did it make people did not need the russians to make up their minds about mrs clinton mr trump s election opponent blaming her loss on the russians was as one trump supporter here said just being sore losers i don t think the russians posed as big a problem to the clintons as the clintons posed to themselves said paul emenes 49 while he sold ribs shoulders and chops at a frigid outdoor farmers market in covington russian hacking was concerning sure mr emenes said he added that as long as mr trump was not involved himself it doesn t change the way i view him tina gunaldo 44 taking blankets off the citrus trees in her mandeville la front yard after the previous night s frost had a similar attitude trump is trump she said do i think he s going to become more of a friend to russia because of this no i don t i think i hope his focus will be on making america great again ms gunaldo would not reveal whom she voted for but she did say mr trump s slogan resonated with her it apparently resonated quite widely in this parish which he won by more than 50 points but it was a quiet support she said she knew of only one yard in the whole subdivision with a sign that yard belonged to thurston yates sr i don t believe it mr yates 78 said flatly of the intelligence report he was standing in the yard under his make america great again flag which he bought at a gun show several months ago why would putin even want trump mr yates who is retired from a career in pharmaceutical sales was not concerned about what mr trump might do in office but said he was deeply alarmed about what president obama might do before he leaves office it was mr obama who was too soft on russia who let mr putin get away with things mr yates continued mr trump would be much tougher but mr yates then added why is everybody so afraid of russia i m not against putin this last sentiment was not uncommon even among those who were troubled by the hacks few felt that russia was a serious threat the country was a basket case and not the powerful foe it once was said mr marino from his seat at mcdonald s others said that north korea the islamic state and china were the real threats russia could even be a potential ally in some fights suggested valarie kubacki 54 a real estate broker in valparaiso ind ms kubacki said she perceived russia as somewhere in the middle between friend and enemy but agreed with mr trump that the united states could work with them to defeat the islamic state also known as isis or isil we may have to line up with people who may not be our friend to make that happen she said that those on the right seemed to be warming to russia was not seen as a particularly unusual development though some joked about the incongruity of the left putting such faith in the central intelligence agency as they watched their son skate with his boy scout group at the public ice rink in downtown valparaiso monty and mary willis both registered republicans considered the ramifications of the intelligence report the idea of a fair election had been placed in doubt ms willis said we were concerned about money being involved in the election now you re talking about espionage the willises who both work in real estate might be republicans but they were not trump voters in fact they had last voted for a republican presidential candidate in 2008 when senator john mccain of arizona ran the party seemed to have changed in recent years they said and the incoming administration had them deeply worried our president being in cahoots with the russian government mr willis said yes i m very concerned about that in louisiana david gubert 56 eagle 20 cigarettes in the cab of his pickup with stacks of firewood for sale behind him in the bed like the willises he ruminated on what it would mean if the russians had gotten involved and

       " 'miami by the time donald robertson a retired architect arrived at fort international airport s terminal 1 on friday afternoon the mass shooting in terminal 2 which left five people dead had been over for at least an hour the accused gunman esteban santiago was in police custody and the airport had largely returned to its normal rhythm passengers were noshing charging their phones watching television things were so sedate that mr robertson did not even realize there had been a shooting but as he made his way past the gate mr robertson looked up and saw a stampede of people including what looked like law enforcement agents racing toward him it was tremendous he said it was like a herd reacting everyone around me was diving under chairs a rumor about a possible second gunman had spread across the airport via social media news sites and word of mouth people panicked and the airport was shut down a turn of events that upended what had seemed like an orderly finale to a tragic afternoon what followed that single rumor was a rush of terror for travelers and airport workers as they fled to the tarmac were separated from loved ones injured themselves in the tumult hid in kitchens and storage rooms and hunkered down behind luggage trucks chaos and uncertainty unfolded over the next 12 hours through it all travelers said they were frustrated every step of the way by the dearth of information about whether they were safe where to go once the airport was shut down and how they could retrieve the thousands of items 23 000 according to a tally by airport officials that were scattered across terminals for the thousands who fled the terminals seeking refuge on the tarmac or hiding wherever they could food and water quickly became scarce bathrooms were nonexistent passengers on some planes that were either preparing to take off or trying to reach a gate were stuck on board for up to seven hours travelers said that some level of pandemonium is to be expected after a shooting and they praised law enforcement for the swift response but it was the aftermath of the rumor which was debunked relatively quickly that left them bewildered and angry nobody gave us information and as time went on we were treated more and more like suspects mr robertson said referring to the by law enforcement and orders for people to raise their hands as they walked from the airport down side roads when they decided to clear the terminal that created terror and it was real terror people were really really really terrified and crying sheriff scott israel of broward county fla said he issued the order to close the entire airport as a safety precaution after he received information that perhaps gunfire had happened and an active shooter was in another terminal at that point he said the safety of the people at the airport was paramount i made a decision to clear the airport sheriff israel said in an interview i worked with our swat team and other swat teams to clear the entire airport and the parking garage to make sure we didn t have any other active shooter it was a voluminous undertaking and we did it as horrific and horrible as this scene was until that point he said the plan was by the book had the misinformation of the active shooter not surfaced he said we would have had buses to the airport within 30 minutes sheriff israel said he could not remember how long it took to confirm there was no second gunman the authorities debunked the rumor about 30 to 45 minutes after it had started to spread raising questions about whether the airport could have been reopened right away by then law enforcement was already sweeping the airport and garages it is still unclear how the rumor began several travelers said in interviews that they heard what they believed to be gunshots in terminal 3 something that sounded like loud pops sheriff israel said that he was told somebody saw a bloody person and assumed a second gunman was loose providing accurate information to passengers and airport and airline staff members also proved challenging law enforcement typically can access wireless emergency alerts the system that sends amber alerts but alerts were not used to inform people that the danger had passed or instruct them on what to do next some airports have internal communication systems for employees to send important messages it is unknown whether this was in place at the fort lauderdale airport instead news accurate and otherwise traveled through word of mouth or was gleaned from cellphones airports can put out messages to employees and that is important because passengers will tend to follow directions from uniformed employees in the know said douglas mansel the aviation security manager at oakland international airport in oakland calif all airports have emergency plans approved by the federal aviation administration including for scenarios the fort lauderdale airport s director mark e gale was not available to comment on airport protocols or on how events unfolded on friday sheriff israel said that communication proved tricky with so many people spread out across different areas including on the tarmac and in garages it was hard to get information out i tried to tell as many people verbally he said communication is critical but there is no way to communicate to thousands anne buongiorno 56 who was visiting from canada had to evacuate terminal 2 twice the first time after the shooting she and her daughter jumped under a seat their hands over their heads her husband was in the bathroom terrified they followed a surge of people down a staircase but people were shoving one another she fell down and broke her rib she and her daughter ended up on the tarmac and were told to lie on the ground near a luggage truck a while later they were told to go back inside a similar scenario played out as the report spread of the possible second gunman ms buongiorno said she again wound up among thousands of people on the tarmac clusters of people ran back and forth fleeing what they feared was a threat as the rumor took hold ms buongiorno hid behind a truck and waited nearly for five hours before being led to a hangar and later put on a bus for the cruise port nobody gave her information about where to go so she used to ipad to find a hotel got in a long line for a cab and went there the next day she was back at the airport waiting for word about how to get her belongings and fly back to canada it was the first time in my life i was so afraid she said her voice quavering at the memory i m afraid still when i heard somebody talk over there i m afraid others joined the long line of people who were told to walk out of the airport along a set of railroad tracks which skirted a marshy area

       " 'family members say that esteban santiago the suspect in the fort lauderdale airport shooting in which five people were killed seemed troubled when he came back from military service in iraq his brother described him as more furious after his deployment in 2010 with a puerto rico national guard unit his aunt said that after coming home mr santiago lost his mind after mr santiago s arrest in the shooting emerging details of his military service led some to blame the rampage on the mind of a veteran haunted by stress disorder a common pattern when veterans are arrested in violent crimes but experts not connected to mr santiago s mental health treatment say it may be a mistake to blame ptsd mr santiago who served for eight years in the national guard and army reserve and saw combat in iraq in 2010 exhibited symptoms that do not appear to fit the disorder they say and more closely resemble schizophrenia a condition unrelated to military service mr santiago s family said he reported hearing voices and had other hallucinations but said he was never given a diagnosis of ptsd in november he walked into an f b i office in alaska and told agents that his mind was being controlled by a united states intelligence agency the delusions the hallucinations are far more consistent with psychosis than ptsd said dr donald c goff a psychiatrist at new york university and a leading expert on schizophrenia so is the timing of the onset mr santiago deployed to iraq when he was 20 years old which is the age when many males with schizophrenia begin to exhibit symptoms dr goff said cautioning that he could not comment on mr santiago specifically without reviewing his medical records generally it s in the first year of college or military service or some other stressful event that we see schizophrenia he said it s not that deployment is the cause of the psychosis but the stress may contribute to the symptoms coming out the level of stress mr santiago experienced on deployment is unclear he went to iraq with the puerto rico national guard s 1013th engineering company and was charged with keeping highways clear of roadside bombs violence had dropped drastically in the country by 2010 nonetheless two soldiers in his company were killed by a roadside bomb after his tour mr santiago was awarded the combat action badge which is given only to service members who are actively engaged with the enemy there is nothing to say that a person can t have psychosis and ptsd said claude m chemtob a professor of psychology at new york university who has studied the link between ptsd and aggression but he said the two disorders are characterized by different symptoms ptsd sufferers can struggle with anxiety sleeplessness flashbacks and anger in rare cases the disorder results in increased violence and aggressiveness but paranoid delusions are not typical that is a cardinal symptom of psychosis dr chemtob said but inevitably people s prejudice toward veterans is going to lead them to emphasize ptsd veterans have complained that too often they are labeled with the disorder and that ascribing all violent acts among veterans to the psychological scars of war perpetuates damaging stereotypes many have argued that is what happened with eddie ray routh the former marine corporal who killed chris kyle a member of the navy seals and the author of american sniper in 2013 mr routh s medical records revealed he had persistent delusions that he was being devoured from the inside by parasites and that his were pig people who wanted to eat him but a doctor at a veterans hospital gave him a diagnosis of ptsd veterans have struggled with the reputation for being dangerously unstable since at least the vietnam war the stigma was stoked in part by hollywood narratives like rambo and is still pervasive today said bill rausch the executive director of got your 6 a nonprofit group that tracks the public image of veterans according to a survey by the group in 2016 83 percent of respondents said they believed veterans were more likely to have mental health problems respondents also said they thought veterans were more likely to be unemployed and abuse drugs in fact in terms of employment and drug use the opposite is true the public sees veterans as broken and they often shape the narrative to fit their perceptions mr rausch said when the news of the fort lauderdale shooting broke he said my first thought was that i hoped no one was hurt my second was that i hoped it wasn t a veteran because i knew if they were it would spark a simplified explanation that would never happen with a civilian tying everything back to war after telling the f b i in november that his mind was being controlled mr santiago was taken to a civilian psychiatric hospital the law prevents patients from being held involuntarily if they are not an imminent threat to themselves or others mr santiago was released after four days anyone who has ever known someone with mental illness knows it s extremely complicated and hard to deal with mr rausch said blaming on military experience keeps us from having a real conversation about how to fix things this isn t a veteran problem it s an american problem ',\n",
       " 'charleston s c the federal trial to determine whether dylann s roof will receive the death penalty for his murderous rampage at an church has become a delicate balancing act pitting the desire of prosecutors to convey the fullness of grief for the nine devout victims against the due process rights of an unrepentant white supremacist who largely declines to defend himself in three days of testimony last week prosecutors questioned 20 spouses children grandchildren and friends of the victims to draw painfully poignant portraits of men and women who were pillars of their church families and community jurors heard not only the tributes of the bereaved but in some cases the voices of the dead recordings of the rev clementa c pinckney lecturing proudly about the history of emanuel a m e church the rev depayne middleton doctor booming a soulful a cappella solo the rev sharonda praying in a crescendo at the funeral of a friend the government s lawyers called two or three witnesses to render a portrait of each victim testimony about one of the deceased the youngest tywanza sanders remains for monday the prosecution plans to rest its case that day and mr roof who is representing himself has said he will not call any witnesses closing arguments are expected on tuesday mr roof 22 stared straight ahead or down at the defense table avoiding eye contact with witnesses who lost composure on the stand and jurors who sometimes dabbed away tears when a prosecutor would conclude his gentle questioning which could draw on for more than an hour judge richard m gergel of federal district court would call for mr roof dressed in a sweater and slacks would rise slightly from his seat and announce no questions that dynamic has prompted a series of challenges by mr roof and pointed exchanges between judge gergel and david i bruck the veteran capital defender whom mr roof has sidelined about how much is too much it is not fair to allow that much testimony to be heard by the jury when i am not presenting any evidence from my family or anyone else in mitigation mr roof argued on wednesday in a motion that judge gergel denied if i don t present any mitigation evidence the evidence will take over the whole sentencing trial and guarantee that i get the death penalty found guilty in december on 33 counts including 18 that carry a potential death sentence mr roof has rejected mr bruck s strategy of presenting evidence about his background and mental health that might mitigate against his execution the lawyer has been relegated to the role of standby counsel allowed to sit beside mr roof and offer guidance but not to question witnesses or to object to the government s evidence the usually mr bruck has not been able to contain his frustration at several points last week with the jury out of the courtroom he pleaded with judge gergel to rein in the prosecution and to empower him to object to testimony this is sentencing it is not a memorial service said mr bruck who has often expressed his admiration for the victims and his sorrow for their families it has become a runaway freight train mr bruck told judge gergel that mr roof did not have the capacity or courage to offer objections and consistently ignored the suggestions he passed along in notes he said he had advised mr roof to move for a mistrial judge gergel has had none of it he lectured mr bruck that he had twice held competency hearings and determined that mr roof met the legal thresholds to stand trial and represent himself a constitutional right i have not noticed the bashfulness to make an objection any time he feels it appropriate the judge told mr bruck on friday he asked mr roof if he felt uncomfortable doing so no mr roof replied saying no more the judge has however cautioned julius n richardson an assistant united states attorney to restrict the number of victim impact witnesses and the length of their testimony at some point it s too much judge gergel said i m worried about the cumulative effect yet he also acknowledged the emotion of the memories offered from the stand there is no antiseptic way to do this he said although they gradually acceded to judge gergel s suggestion to streamline their case prosecutors have argued that the scale of the massacre justified a large number of witnesses he is the one who chose to kill nine people mr richardson said of mr roof who according to testimony wore shoes to a closed hearing last week bearing a symbol of white supremacy he is the one who chose to go into a church to do it and he s the one who chose to do it to particularly good people impact statements at capital trials and the legal questions surrounding them rose to prominence in the 1980s as victims rights advocates won public support including the passage of a law that altered the federal rules of criminal procedure but in 1987 the united states supreme court ruled that such evidence in capital cases was a constitutionally unacceptable risk four years later it reversed that position when it ruled in payne v tennessee victim impact evidence is simply another form or method of informing the sentencing authority about the specific harm caused by the crime in question chief justice william h rehnquist wrote for the majority such evidence has become a staple of capital proceedings before timothy mcveigh was sentenced to death for the 1995 oklahoma city bombing which killed 168 people prosecutors called 38 victim impact witnesses mr roof noted in a motion more than a dozen testified at the 2015 trial of dzhokhar tsarnaev who received the death penalty for the boston marathon attack that left three people dead and more than 250 wounded researchers have repeatedly found that such evidence has substantial effects on jurors who are weighing capital punishment mr roof s choice to not call witnesses means that jurors will not hear that evidence which tends to dampen the emotional effect of grieving relatives said scott e sundby a law professor at the university of miami who has studied juror behavior in capital cases victim impact witnesses cannot by law opine about the penalty they prefer but the jurors in charleston have heard stories of intense suffering and loss one after another prosecutors began by eliciting heartfelt reminiscences of family gatherings and final conversations then pivoted to the excruciating moments of discovery after the killings of june 17 2015 i dropped the phone and just started jumping and fell on the floor and stayed there for two hours recalled bethane middleton brown ms doctor s sister i couldn t move jurors saw an affecting video of chris singleton the son of ms rapping a tribute to his charismatic mother took your life in the middle of the church and i just pray mama that you weren t hurt they heard malcolm r graham a former north carolina state senator describe the deep void left by the death of his sister cynthia hurd a longtime county librarian who served as his mentor and political guide i m alive i m fit but something is missing he said i can t go to the store and replace it i can t reinvent it walter jackson jr seemed to find cruel irony in his grandmother susie jackson s being taken in a hate crime she was 87 when she passed and that s someone who s gone through racism discrimination segregation he said yet she was still that kind of person who still had that unconditional love for everyone daniel l simmons jr told of his initial bewilderment that his father the rev daniel simmons sr a vietnam veteran with a license to carry a concealed weapon had not done more to protect the churchgoers as he always had his family he got his answer after receiving the keys to his father s car from the coroner and finding the gun inside when i opened the car it was sitting on the front seat mr simmons said he took it off before he went to church death penalty critics complain that the testimony here has traded on the inherent nobility of the victims to advance what they consider the most ignoble of punishments one that many members of the families say they oppose they note the paradox that a death sentence for mr roof may bolster support for maintaining a penalty that has been inflicted disproportionately on some said the impact evidence may produce grounds for an appeal henderson hill a lawyer who founded the center for death penalty litigation and who attended the proceedings last week said the tenor amounted to a whistle for a life for a life this is so far past the pale of what is acceptable practice that i find it just unrecognizable as a capital sentencing proceeding he said i ve never seen this kind of celebration of life even in black churches where the traditions are that services go on forever

       " 'about 25 years ago a conversation between me and one of the greatest biologists of the 20th century took a weird turn i was talking to william d hamilton who was famous for coming up with the theory of kin selection which explains patterns of altruism among close relatives in various species including ours this and other seminal ideas had earned hamilton a place in the pantheon of thinkers who ushered in the modern darwinian understanding of social behavior richard dawkins in the preface to his landmark 1976 book the selfish gene paid tribute to hamilton and the three other dominant figures in social biology whose ideas formed the book s foundation i was interviewing hamilton at the university of michigan where he was on sabbatical from oxford a video camera was rolling i had been researching a book about evolutionary psychology and i was hoping to create a documentary on the subject the documentary never materialized and hamilton died in early 2000 my interview with him sat unwatched until earlier this year when i tracked down the tape containing it during the interview i was trying to steer hamilton toward philosophical topics and at one point he went further than i had expected he said i m also quite open to the view that there is some kind of ultimate good which is of a religious nature that we just have to look beyond what the evolutionary theory tells us and accept promptings of what ultimate good is coming from some other source that s an unusual thing for a great evolutionary biologist to say but the most unusual part was still to come hamilton continued in his british accent i could enlarge on that in terms of the possible existence of extraterrestrial manipulators who interfere and so on but i think this would be getting too far from the general topic of discussion well maybe but this sounded at least as interesting as the general topic of discussion i asked him if he meant that there was some kind of transcendental purpose that we humans are generally oblivious to he answered yes yes there s one theory of the universe that i rather like i accept it in an almost joking spirit and that is that planet earth in our solar system is a kind of zoo for extraterrestrial beings who dwell out there somewhere and this is the best the most interesting experiment they could set up to set up the evolution on planet earth going in such a way that it would produce these really interesting characters humans who go around doing things and they watch their experiment interfering hardly at all so that almost everything we do comes out according to the laws of nature but every now and then they see something which doesn t look quite right this zoo is going to kill itself off if they let you do this or that so he continued these extraterrestrials insert a finger and just change some little thing and maybe those are the miracles which the religious people like to so emphasize he reiterated i put it forward in an almost joking spirit but i think it s a kind of hypothesis that s very very hard to dismiss the headline almost writes itself scientist says miracles can happen the subhead would add extraterrestrials may play a role but that s the headline you d write if you were just trying to maximize clicks if you wanted to capture the philosophical significance of what hamilton was saying you d take another tack rather than focus on miracles you d focus on the idea of higher purpose the idea that there s some point to life on earth that emanates from something that is in some sense beyond it and in hopes of generating as many clicks as possible notwithstanding the philosophical significance you d put this in listicle form laying out several misconceptions that hamilton had implicitly dispelled you could call these the three great myths about evolution and purpose myth number one to say that there s in some sense a higher purpose means there are spooky forces at work when i ask scientifically minded people if they think life on earth may have some larger purpose they typically say no if i ask them to explain their view it often turns out that they think that answering yes would mean departing from a scientific worldview embracing the possibility of supernatural beings or at the very least of immaterial factors that lie beyond scientific measurement but hamilton s thought experiment shows that this isn t necessarily so you may consider aliens spooky but they re not a spooky force and they re not supernatural beings they re just physical beings like us their technology is so advanced that their interventions might seem miraculous to us as various smartphone apps would seem to my but these interventions would in fact comply with the laws of science more to the point if you ask how hamilton s aliens had initially imparted purpose to life the answer is that they did so in concrete fashion by planting simple material on earth a few billion years ago confident that it would lead to something that would keep them entertained keeping them entertained being in this scenario life s purpose which leads to myth number two to say that evolution has a purpose is to say that it is driven by something other than natural selection the correction of this misconception is in some ways just a corollary of the correction of the first misconception but it s worth spelling out evolution can have a purpose even if it is a wholly mechanical material process that is even if its sole engine is natural selection after all clocks have purposes to keep time a purpose imparted by clockmakers and they re wholly mechanical of course to suggest that evolution involves the unfolding of some purpose is to suggest that evolution has in some sense been heading somewhere namely toward the realization of its purpose which leads to myth number three evolution couldn t have a purpose because it doesn t have a direction the idea that evolution is fundamentally directionless is widespread in part because one great popularizer of evolution stephen jay gould worked hard to leave that impression as i and others have argued gould was at best misleading on this point and anyway even gould admitted that yes on balance evolution tends to create beings of greater and greater complexity a number of evolutionary biologists would go further and say that evolution was likely given long enough to create animals as intelligent as us in fact that idea is implicit in hamilton s saying the aliens could have set up evolution in such a way that it would produce these really interesting characters humans this part of hamilton s scenario requires no intervention on the part of the aliens because he believed that evolution by natural selection has a kind of direction in the sense that it is likely given long enough to produce very intelligent forms of life when speaking more precisely as he did in other parts of the interview hamilton would say that the human species per se wasn t in the cards that it wasn t inevitable that the first intelligent species would look like us with these three myths dispelled you re left with this philosophically liberating upshot you can entertain the possibility that evolution has a purpose a kind of goal a telos as philosophers say without departing from a strictly darwinian view of evolution without abandoning belief in natural selection as evolution s only engine and without surrendering your credentials as a modern scientifically minded kind of person in case you re still feeling a little uneasy about becoming a purpose ponderer i should emphasize that not all teleological scenarios that pass scientific muster involve space aliens indeed some scientists have suggested that natural selection has a purpose that wasn t instilled by any kind of intelligent being this scenario emerges from one version of physicist lee smolin s theory of cosmological natural selection smolin thinks our universe may itself be a product of a kind of evolution maybe universes can replicate themselves via black holes so over time over a lot of time you get universes whose physical laws are more and more conducive to replication so that s why our universe is so good at making in some variants of smolin s theory such as those developed by the late cosmologist edward harrison and the mathematician louis crane intelligent beings can play a role in this replication once their technology reaches a point where they can produce black holes so through cosmological natural selection you d get universes whose physical properties were more and more conducive to the evolution of intelligent life this might explain the observation that the physical constants of this universe seem to permit the emergence of life crane in a recent dialogue on my website meaningoflife tv told me that in this scenario human life and i don t mean on an individual scale but as a whole has a purpose in the same sense that a chicken s egg has a purpose the purpose of a chicken s egg is to create a chicken crane isn t using language carelessly here some philosophers are comfortable talking about animals having a purpose imbued by natural selection to spread their genes so if biological evolution is a product of cosmological natural selection it has a purpose in a defensible sense of that term and we re part of that purpose so add another item to our listicle myth number four if evolution has a purpose the purpose must have been imbued by an intelligent being that said one interesting feature of current discourse is a growing openness among some scientifically minded people to the possibility that our world has a purpose that was imparted by an intelligent being i m referring to simulation scenarios which hold that our seemingly tangible world is actually a kind of projection emanating from some sort of powerful computer and the history of our universe including evolution on this planet is the unfolding of a computer algorithm whose author must be pretty bright you may scoff but in 2003 the philosopher nick bostrom of oxford university published a paper laying out reasons to think that we are pretty likely to be living in a simulation and the simulation hypothesis has gained influential supporters neil degrasse tyson director of the hayden planetarium and america s de facto astronomer laureate finds it plausible the visionary tech entrepreneur elon musk says there s almost no chance that we re living in base reality the new yorker reported earlier this year that two tech billionaires it didn t say whether musk is one of them have gone so far as to secretly engage scientists to work on breaking us out of the simulation i m guessing that will take awhile and meanwhile i d like to note an irony when an argument for higher purpose is put this way that is when it doesn t involve the phrase higher purpose and further is cast more as a technological scenario than a metaphysical one it is considered intellectually respectable i don t mean there aren t plenty of people who dismiss it i m talking about how people dismiss it the bostrom paper drew flack but a lot of it was from people who thought the chances that we re living in a simulation are way less than 50 percent not from people who thought the idea was wholly crazy if you walked up to the same people who gave bostrom a respectful hearing and told them there is a transcendent god many would dismiss the idea out of hand yet the simulation hypothesis is a god hypothesis an intelligence of power created our universe for reasons we can speculate about but can t entirely fathom and assuming this intelligence still exists it is in some sense outside of our reality beyond the reach of our senses and yet presumably it has the power to intervene in our world theology has entered secular discourse under another name personally i m fine with that i think discussion of higher purpose should be respectable even in a scientific age i don t mean i buy the simulation scenario in particular or the space alien scenario or the cosmological natural selection scenario but i do think there s reason to suspect that there s some point to this exercise we earthlings are engaged in some purpose imbued by something and that even if identifying that something is for now hopeless there are grounds for speculating about what the point of the exercise is i won t elaborate much on this since i ve done that elsewhere arguing that higher purpose can be framed as a hypothesis and that evidence for or against the hypothesis can be marshaled but i will say that the evidence i see for purpose includes not just the direction of biological evolution but the direction of technological evolution and of the broader social and cultural evolution it drives the evolution that has carried us from bands to the brink of a cohesive global community and if the purpose involves sustaining this direction becoming a true global community then it would seem to include moral progress in particular our purpose would involve transcending the psychology of tribalism that can otherwise divide people along ethnic national religious and ideological lines which would mean in light of recent political and social developments in the united states and abroad that our work is cut out for us ',\n",
       " 'pittsburgh the miami dolphins won the coin toss sunday and kicked off to the pittsburgh steelers a decision that in retrospect seemed a tad misguided but then it was not as if electing to receive would have been a wiser choice a more prudent if somewhat unorthodox strategy would have been doing something else entirely with the football hiding it for example maybe beneath the dolphins parkas because without the ball the steelers offense could not score and if the steelers offense could not score then the dolphins might actually have stood a chance of winning sunday s playoff game at heinz field instead of absorbing a comprehensive demolition the defeat which reaffirmed pittsburgh as a formidable a f c contender held less suspense than a romantic comedy all of 2 minutes 45 seconds elapsed before pittsburgh scored on an exquisite 50 yards by antonio brown that preceded another exquisite by brown 62 yards which preceded a scoring rush by le veon bell who accounted for all 78 yards on that drive excluding a penalty all on runs 10 in a row it was as if the steelers kept giving him the ball because they had grown bored of demoralizing miami through the air finishing with 167 yards bell set the team postseason record in his playoff debut he missed the playoffs two seasons ago with a hyperextended knee last year a torn knee ligament sidelined him the steelers have been eagerly waiting for their redoubtable trio of bell brown and quarterback ben roethlisberger who completed his first 11 passes for 188 yards to play in the postseason together they combined for all four touchdowns scored across the first seven series one was a before halftime in a performance that showcased pittsburgh at the apex of its intimidating might we can attack in different ways bell said all of them are devastating especially those that involve brown who turned two short passes into long touchdowns and bell not since barry sanders perhaps has the n f l seen a running back as destructively patient as bell he takes the handoff then he waits i m standing back there and i m watching and i m like uh are you going to go any time here roethlisberger said of bell the length of bell s pause varies from play to play but it allows him to survey the field set up his blockers and find creases accelerating through he leaves defenders in his wake then drags them through it he s a man for all situations or circumstances coach mike tomlin said when miami s defensive coordinator vance joseph was asked last week how he prioritized containing brown bell and roethlisberger he chose bell first if you can t contain bell you can t contain a b joseph said using brown s nickname the dolphins overwhelmed by the challenge did neither the burden of preparing for the steelers now belongs to the kansas city chiefs who will host pittsburgh on sunday afternoon in a rematch of a week 4 game the steelers won by 29 points that night but there is folly in perceiving past as prologue the dolphins resurfacing in the postseason after an absence elicited much joy not only in south florida but also in western pennsylvania where the steelers seethed all week eager to avenge an october rout that win ignited miami s recovery from a start and foretold the steamrollering that running back jay ajayi who rushed for 204 yards that day would administer to defensive game plans even thinking about that defeat angered the steelers defensive coordinator keith butler who said it really challenges your manhood the steelers pride themselves on playing a physical style shoved around that day they vowed to inflict pain sunday we just wanted to get out there and be as physical and as violent as we could be safety mike mitchell said like i said our was to tee off on them it wasn t to wrap up and make tackles ajayi exceeded 200 yards twice more during the regular season he never came close sunday smothered by pittsburgh s front he finished with 33 yards on 16 carries we always can get better but we was cooking today defensive end stephon tuitt said it was fun to cook the essence of mitchell s proclamation the goal was to tee off on them i can t say that enough permeated the rest of the defense which nearly turned miami s suboptimal quarterback situation even more dire midway through the second quarter starting a fourth consecutive week in place of the injured ryan tannehill knee matt moore left the pocket and after releasing a pass encountered linebacker bud dupree he did not hit moore so much as nearly dislodge moore s head from his body you just see a sack said dupree who had not yet seen a replay moore crumpled to the field and lay there as a skirmish that began near the miami sideline expanded closer to midfield it seemed to take less time for moore to be examined for a concussion and other injuries than he spent on the ground he missed one play i got checked out i felt fine moore said it was more of my jaw than anything else i felt good i came back in and i was fine on that drive the dolphins kicked a field goal to draw to within but on their next two series on either side of halftime moore was losing the ball and soon enough the game for the dolphins pittsburgh which has won eight straight has not lost since nov 13 when dallas pilfered a late victory that earned the wrath of roethlisberger who demanded afterward that the steelers play with more discipline and accountability those elements returned and so did the a f c north crown borrowed for a year by cincinnati the steelers reached this stage of the playoffs last season before losing at denver they did not have bell or even brown who sat with a concussion now they have both and roethlisberger who said he would play next week despite an injured ankle encased afterward in a walking boot and a healthy offensive line and a snarling defense but still i m not excited about this guard ramon foster said after the win why it s bigger than this week he added referring to the coming game

       " 'tehran with the death of ayatollah ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani on sunday iran s political factions knew immediately that any space by reformers to maneuver had just significantly decreased change had come and it did not favor those seeking to turn iran into a less revolutionary country with more tolerance and outreach to the west especially the united states mr rafsanjani a former president who helped found the islamic republic had been the one man too large to be sidelined by conservative now he was suddenly gone dead from what state media described as cardiac arrest and with no one influential enough to fill his shoes iran s reformists and moderates who would use mr rafsanjani s regular calls for more personal freedoms and requests to establish better relations with the united states to advance their political agendas suddenly felt exposed and weakened who would now warn publicly against islamic fascism when the sought to influence elections who would state openly that there should be a nuclear compromise mr rafsanjani said things others would not dare to say all agreed and his voice had at least created some tolerance for debates will be happy but this is the start of a period of anxiety for many said fazel meybodi a cleric from the holy city qum who supports reforms in iran his death disturbs the fragile balance we had in iran there simply are no replacements for mr rafsanjani analysts from all factions say his death also reflects the dwindling number of leaders from the generation that overthrew the shah nearly four decades ago most are now in their 80s or even older it is a very powerful reminder that iran is at the beginning of a major leadership transition that will play a very psychological role in iran s politics said vali r nasr a middle east scholar who is dean of the johns hopkins school of advanced international studies i think this in some ways rattles iran s political system in that it underscores the fact that with everything else going on syria the nuclear deal there will be a passing of the baton to the next generation mr nasr said two of mr rafsanjani s most important protégés hassan rouhani the current president and mohammad khatami a former president both owe their political careers to him but mr rouhani up for this year is fighting for his political life mr khatami who has been sidelined by conservative adversaries for years is now even weaker mr rouhani managed to create a coalition to win the elections in 2013 with mr rafsanjani s support having successfully negotiated a nuclear agreement with the united states and other big powers partly from encouragement by mr rafsanjani mr rouhani promised a bright economic future for iran which has yet to happen with the demise of his mentor and protector iran s president will find it hard to gather the same level of support he received four years ago with the backing of mr rafsanjani analysts say he was a very powerful figure for mr rouhani to rely upon said mohammad marandi a professor at tehran university who is close to iran s leaders many worked with him because of that support the passing of mr rafsanjani complicates the president s position and makes his less certain mr khatami won presidential elections in 1997 after having received mr rafsanjani s support and led iran through an era of greater personal freedoms and western outreach that was quashed by unelected centers of power it is mr khatami who should take on the burden of the late ayatollah hashemi rafsanjani s responsibility said mohammadreza shamsolvaezin a former reformist politician and activist but mr khatami is all but paralyzed politically the judiciary has ordered all iranian media not to carry his picture or even quote his website besides appearances at theater plays religious gatherings and art exhibitions mr khatami has remained silent mr rafsanjani could speak more freely than others not only because of his revolutionary credentials but also because of his friendship with ayatollah ali khamenei whom he helped become supreme leader in 1989 ayatollah khamenei who has skillfully played all iranian factions would never go as far as to completely isolate mr rafsanjani even when he supported protests that followed the disputed 2009 presidential election while the presidential candidates mir hossein mousavi and mehdi karroubi were placed under house arrest in 2011 for their criticisms mr rafsanjani was stripped of several functions but never purged in a statement ayatollah khamenei lamented the passing of mr rafsanjani still it was clear to many that ayatollah khamenei regarded him not only as a friend but a rival whose absence could now make the role of supreme leader even more powerful the loss of a comrade and ally with whom i share a friendship that dates back to 59 years ago is difficult and said a statement posted on ayatollah khamenei s website on sunday he also referred obliquely to their disagreements differences in views and interpretations of islamic law in various points of this long time could never break the friendship the statement said after him i cannot think of anyone with whom i share such long history and experience along the highs and lows of historical moments joined in on the mourning giving public statements of condolence but with the realization that the political wind in iran would now blow even more in their favor for them mr rafsanjani had been a wild card who could evoke rulings from the founder of the islamic republic ayatollah ruhollah khomeini that would oppose their rigid narrative of isolation and mr rafsanjani was especially dangerous they said because of his conviction that iran had changed and that establishing relations with the united states was the only way to secure the future of the islamic republic mr rafsanjani also had cordial ties with the leaders of saudi arabia iran s principal rival in the middle east who share a mutual hostility with ayatollah khamenei also have faulted mr rafsanjani for having founded a chain of affordable universities during the reconstruction that followed the war some conservatives now blame these schools for having helped sow what they regard as the dangerous modernist aspirations of iran s middle class many conservatives in iran also suspected mr rafsanjani of having used his contacts to undercut ayatollah khamenei on issues where ayatollah khamenei would choose ideology over diplomacy mr rafsanjani preferred pragmatism and change to keep the ruling system in power the invisible hands of the late ali akbar rafsanjani are gone said hamidreza taraghi a political analyst who has close relations with many of iran s top leaders this means an end to secret meetings by reformists and moderates seeking closer ties with america from now on we can make decisions much easier and with more coordination ',\n",
       " 'ayatollah ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani a former president of iran and a founder of the islamic republic who navigated the opaque shoals of his country s theocracy as one of its most enduring wiliest and wealthiest leaders died on sunday in tehran he was 82 his death was announced by iranian state television as his career seesawed through periods of revolutionary zeal and confrontation with powerful conservative rivals he was portrayed as a machiavellian and often ruthless player in the power struggles among iran s elite factions protected by his close association with ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the revolutionary leader who overthrew the shah in 1979 known as a pragmatist and centrist inclined toward economic liberalism and political authoritarianism mr rafsanjani was accused by critics of corruption in amassing his fortune and of a readiness for harsh tactics to deal with dissent at home and abroad argentina has accused mr rafsanjani and other senior iranian figures of complicity in the 1994 bombing of a jewish community center in buenos aires in which 85 people died in 1997 a german court concluded that the highest levels of iran s political leadership had ordered the killing five years earlier of four exiled iranian kurdish dissidents in berlin the events added weight to american assertions that iran was a sponsor of terrorism mr rafsanjani was president from 1989 to 1997 yet many western analysts believed that he sought a less confrontational relationship with the united states than other powerful figures in the iranian hierarchy for whom hostility toward washington was a touchstone of ideological purity mr rafsanjani for instance was credited with suggesting that death to america be dropped from the litany of slogans at tehran s friday prayers a weekly moment of fervor in iran s political and religious calendar in the closing stages of the war which lasted from 1980 to 1988 mr rafsanjani was appointed acting commander in chief of iranian forces and was widely credited with persuading the leadership in tehran to accept a united nations resolution that ended the fighting for much of his career he maintained roles in parliament and on influential clerical panels under the tutelage of ayatollah khomeini and then less durably of his successor ayatollah ali khamenei mr rafsanjani s clout declined sharply during the presidency of mahmoud ahmadinejad from 2005 to 2013 a populist conservative mr ahmadinejad had a strong following among poor iranians many of whom resented the affluence that endeared mr rafsanjani to his wealthier compatriots in 2013 mr rafsanjani was disqualified from standing in presidential elections and swung his political weight behind a moderate longtime associate hassan rouhani who won the vote and went on to bring many of mr rafsanjani s supporters into his cabinet and to negotiate the nuclear agreement with the united states in 2015 but mr rafsanjani himself an ayatollah clashed with ayatollah khamenei the supreme leader over the extent to which iran should modify its bellicose stance toward outsiders in march mr rafsanjani wrote on twitter that the world of tomorrow is one of negotiations not the world of missiles ayatollah khamenei responded enemies continue strengthening their military and missile sectors how can anyone say the era of missiles has passed without identifying mr rafsanjani by name ayatollah khamenei said people say that tomorrow s world is a world of negotiations and not a world of missiles if they say this thoughtlessly it shows they are thoughtless however if this is intentional then this is treachery for all that analysts in tehran sensed that the pendulum was swinging toward the moderate camp in which mr rafsanjani played a defining role ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani was born on aug 23 1934 in the village of bahraman near the town of rafsanjan in iran s southeastern kerman province he was one of five sons and four daughters born to mirza ali hashemi bahramani a prosperous pistachio farmer and mahbibi safarian hashemi at 14 he left his home village to study theology in the muslim holy city of qum iran where he became a disciple of ayatollah khomeini by some accounts at the time of his death mr rafsanjani was the last surviving member of an inner circle of islamic revolutionaries active during ayatollah khomeini s exile from 1964 to 1979 fighting an often bloody contest with the notorious savak secret police loyal to shah mohammed reza pahlavi from 1963 to 1978 mr rafsanjani was jailed five times for his opposition to the shah but he remained in close contact with exiled clerics including ayatollah khomeini who was living in najaf iraq during that period in 1962 he married effat marashi whose family included several respected shiite clerics they had five children two daughters fatemeh and faezeh and three sons mohsen mehdi and yaser information on survivors was not immediately available in the turbulence after ayatollah khomeini returned to iran mr rafsanjani was elected to parliament known as the majlis and became its speaker serving in that position until 1989 in many accounts of the maneuvering after ayatollah khomeini s death in 1989 mr rafsanjani was credited with promoting ayatollah ali khamenei as supreme leader possibly in the mistaken belief that he would prove a pliant figure instead ayatollah khamenei built his own power base but mr rafsanjani s dealings often trading on his close relationship with ayatollah khomeini earned him the nickname kingmaker during his presidency mr rafsanjani faced the challenge of reconstruction after the war with saddam hussein s iraq while his economic liberalism and privatization policies were popular among iran s entrepreneurial classes many poor iranians perceived no improvement in their plight as president mr rafsanjani showed little tolerance of dissent while he sought improved ties with the west he insisted on iran s right to develop its nuclear program and did not lift a fatwa declared by ayatollah khomeini that enjoined muslims to kill the writer salman rushdie moreover critics asserted that the rafsanjani presidency coincided with the spread of corruption and the infiltration by the islamic revolutionary guards corps of important economic enterprises by 2013 mr rafsanjani was said to have built a family business empire that owned iran s second biggest airline exercised a near monopoly on the lucrative pistachio trade and controlled the largest private university azad the family s business interests also included real estate construction and oil deals in 2003 forbes magazine said mr rafsanjani s personal wealth exceeded 1 billion his time as president left a bitter legacy for many iranians who struggled to get by in parliamentary elections he fared badly and was awarded a seat only after the intervention of a clerical panel prompting him to withdraw from the legislature in 2005 mr rafsanjani sought to run for the presidency again but lost in a runoff to mr ahmadinejad whose tenure until 2013 was marked by nuclear policies increasingly strained ties with the west and a mounting catalog of economic sanctions over tehran s efforts to expand its nuclear capability in presidential elections in june 2009 mr rafsanjani supported the moderate mir hussein moussavi who lost to mr ahmadinejad the outcome was widely disputed and many iranian protesters died or were detained challenging the authorities in the streets the protesters included mr rafsanjani s youngest daughter faezeh who had campaigned for women s rights and was arrested in large demonstrations against mr ahmadinejad s victory in september 2009 mr rafsanjani seemed to be sidelined when the authorities barred him from addressing friday prayers in tehran on quds day an annual display of solidarity with palestinians mr rafsanjani had delivered the quds day sermon for almost 25 years but the authorities in 2009 feared his address would provoke antigovernment protests mr ahmadinejad s second term was marked by mounting disputes with the united states and israel over tehran s nuclear ambitions and its advances in missile technology in 2011 iran sided with president bashar of syria during the arab spring along with the hezbollah shiite militia in lebanon setting tehran against mr assad s western adversaries including the united states in may 2013 mr rafsanjani announced plans for a comeback entering his name for presidential elections that june calculating that after the years of decline under mr ahmadinejad iranians would think that mr rafsanjani s reputation as a pragmatist and modernizer would offset some of the opprobrium attached to his staggering wealth at the time he argued that iran was in an economic danger zone because of mr ahmadinejad s amateurism but he was disqualified by the guardian council an electoral vetting body controlled by mr rafsanjani had long served on another critical panel the assembly of experts which is charged with choosing a successor to the supreme leader in 2016 mr rafsanjani polled first in tehran s voting for the assembly of experts whose role had assumed greater importance since ayatollah khamenei was treated for prostate cancer in 2014 in the manner of iran s competing power centers however a ayatollah ahmad jannati who was already the head of the guardian council was elected by the assembly of experts as its chairman the vote signaled new obstacles for the modest changes sought by mr rouhani in running the islamic republic in another controversy in may 2016 mr rafsanjani was drawn into a ferocious debate over a meeting between his activist daughter faezeh and fariba kamalabadi a leader of the baha is a minority religious group regarded by the clerical hierarchy as impure pagans mr rafsanjani showed little sympathy for his daughter calling the baha is heretics and saying publicly that his daughter had committed a wrong deed and should be ashamed of herself ',\n",

made by the company were programmed to cheat on emissions tests the executive oliver schmidt a german who is the former top emissions compliance manager for volkswagen in the united states was arrested on saturday by investigators in florida on a charge of conspiracy to defraud the united states he is expected to be arraigned on monday the arrest of mr schmidt is an escalation of the criminal investigation into emissions cheating by volkswagen and comes amid talks between the company and the united states justice department about what penalties the carmaker should accept as part

and environmental office based in auburn hills mich for more than a year he and other volkswagen officials repeatedly cited false technical explanations for the high emissions levels the authorities said in september 2015 mr schmidt and other volkswagen officials formally acknowledged the existence of a defeat device that allowed volkswagen cars to cheat emissions tests volkswagen s and belated confession angered officials from the california air resources board and the environmental protection agency and it is likely to have vastly increased the cost to the company from the scandal it has already agreed to pay 16 billion to owners of diesel vehicles and will probably have to pay several billion dollars more in fines volkswagen eventually said that it had fitted 11 million diesel cars worldwide with illegal software that made the vehicles capable of defeating pollution tests the software enabled the cars to sense when they were being tested for emissions and turn on systems to curb emissions at the cost of engine performance but those controls were not fully deployed on the road where cars spewed nitrogen oxide at up to 40 times the levels allowed under the clean air act james liang a former volkswagen engineer who worked for the company in california pleaded guilty in september to charges that included conspiracy to defraud the federal government and violating the clean air act but mr schmidt s arrest brings the investigation into the executive ranks the arrest came as volkswagen and the justice department neared a deal to pay more than 2 billion to resolve the criminal investigation into the emissions cheating the company or one of its corporate entities is expected to plead guilty as part of the deal the settlement could come as early as next week barring any hiccups according to people with knowledge of the negotiations the german automaker has been eager to put the justice department investigation behind it before donald j trump is sworn in on jan 20 american prosecutors had traveled to germany in recent months to interview volkswagen executives according to german prosecutors the criminal case against volkswagen and the potential guilty plea set it apart from other recent auto industry investigations in settlements with general motors and toyota over their handling of safety defects for example the companies agreed to pay large fines but did not plead guilty prosecutors are also mulling criminal charges against takata the japanese manufacturer under criminal investigation for its defective airbags volkswagen has already agreed to pay up to nearly 16 billion to resolve civil claims in what has become one of the largest consumer settlements ever in the united states involving half a million cars under the settlement most car owners have the option of either selling their vehicles back to volkswagen or getting them fixed provided the automaker could propose a fix that satisfied regulators the scandal has affected many volkswagen and audi models including the audi a3 and volkswagen beetle golf jetta and passat diesel cars ',\n",
       " 'jerusalem a palestinian driver plowed a truck into a group of israeli soldiers as they were getting off a bus in jerusalem on sunday afternoon killing four and injuring 17 others according to the police and witnesses the police called the episode an act of terrorism micky rosenfeld a police spokesman said the attacker had been shot and the police released images showing the truck s windshield riddled with bullet holes the dead included three female soldiers and one male soldier the israeli military confirmed several people were hospitalized some with critical injuries prime minister benjamin netanyahu visited the scene of the attack and said the perpetrator was by all indications a supporter of the islamic state this is part of the same pattern inspired by islamic state by isis that we saw first in france then in germany and now in jerusalem this is part of the same ongoing battle against this global scourge of the new terrorism he added mr netanyahu has often made the comparison between local attacks against israelis and those in the rest of the world though the attacks in israel are more broadly viewed as being more connected to the conflict while the israeli security services have described a few palestinian attackers as having been inspired by the ideology of the islamic state no direct links have been established between them and the organization the attack on sunday occurred on the armon hanatziv promenade a popular tourist spot between east jerusalem and west jerusalem that offers sweeping views of the old city the four soldiers killed were erez orbach 20 from alon shvut in the west bank yael yekutiel 20 from givatayim near tel aviv shir hajaja 22 from maale adumim in the west bank and shira tzur 20 from haifa the violence ended several months of relative calm in the contested city after a period of frequent stabbings shootings and car attacks it also underlined the volatility of the situation at a time when donald j trump has promised to move the united states embassy to jerusalem from tel aviv a potentially explosive step that american administrations have avoided for decades palestinian officials say it would destroy the chances of any peace process by prejudging the outcome and some have said it would constitute a declaration of war against palestinians mahmoud abbas the president of the palestinian authority in the west bank said on friday that the palestinians would view any such change in the status quo in jerusalem as the crossing of a red line mosque preachers addressed the proposed embassy move in their sermons during friday prayers apparently on the instruction of the palestinian authority the palestinians demand east jerusalem as the capital of a future palestinian state israel captured the area from jordan in the 1967 war and claims sovereignty there hamas the islamic militant group that holds sway in gaza praised sunday s attack without taking responsibility for it fawzi barhoum a hamas official described it as a courageous and heroic operation in gaza city people were handing out sweets to in celebration nickolay mladenov the united nations special coordinator for the middle east peace process condemned the attack in a statement it is reprehensible that some choose to glorify such acts which undermine the possibility of a peaceful future for both palestinians and israelis he said there is nothing heroic in such actions the palestinian official news agency wafa identified the driver of the truck as fadi ahmad 28 a resident of the nearby palestinian neighborhood of jabel mukaber in east jerusalem ribhi ewiysat a resident of the neighborhood said that a large number of israeli security forces had entered the area and were at the attacker s house chaim newman a tour guide who was accompanying the group of soldiers at the scene told israel radio the soldiers got off the bus and we were getting organized when suddenly the truck came with great speed and rammed into the group civilians and soldiers began shooting and this prevented a worse tragedy he added he rammed them a number of times going into reverse and forward in order to hurt more people chen lendi sharon a paramedic from the magen david adom ambulance service said there was chaos on the scene when she arrived i saw a truck that rammed youngsters getting off the bus next to the armon hanatziv observation point ms lendi sharon said that at least 10 people were trapped under the bus or were lying on the grass by the road the attack occurred around 1 30 p m dozens of soldiers were getting off buses at the site as part of a routine educational tour of jerusalem aged 18 to 21 they were cadets from an officers course israel radio reported about two hours after the attack the truck a white flatbed with a crane on the back remained at the scene and an ambulance was still removing bodies dovy meyer a spokesman for the united hatzalah ambulance service who was at the scene said that around 100 soldiers had been milling about when the attack occurred a spate of deadly stabbings shootings and car attacks began in october 2015 and quickly spread from jerusalem and the west bank to cities around israel more than 30 israelis and two american visitors were among those killed in the attacks more than 240 palestinians have been killed during that period many of them while carrying out or intending to carry out attacks according to israeli officials several attackers have come from the jabel mukaber neighborhood mr netanyahu said the neighborhood had been encircled by security forces

       " 'seattle for a technology to crack the mainstream there is an unspoken understanding it shouldn t make the people who use it want to throw up and yet there was a reminder at last week s international ces trade show in las vegas of how far virtual reality has to go until everyone is ready to fasten goggles to their faces at a news conference intel the chip maker provided virtual reality headsets to about 250 attendees so they could watch a video from the perspective of sky divers hurtling out of a helicopter in wingsuits intel also passed out motion sickness bags to everyone in case anybody felt inclined to vomit an unfortunate side effect of turbulent virtual reality experiences for some people laura anderson an intel spokeswoman said the company had provided the bags out of an abundance of caution and to be tongue in cheek about our immersive experience no one used the bags she said it is time for a reality check for virtual reality one of the most hyped technologies of last year sales of the most capable headsets have been sluggish by most estimates held back by high costs a lack of content and the complexity and awkwardness of the products less expensive mobile headsets that use smartphones as their screens are selling better but are far more limited in what they can do many technologists and early adopters of virtual reality remain unchanged in their conviction that the technology will eventually change how entertainment including games and movies is experienced by the masses the major virtual reality headsets from oculus htc and sony went on sale to the public only last year and those who thought they would find a large audience within months of release had unrealistic expectations virtual reality s advocates say this is going to be a long slog as the technology continues to improve more content becomes available and awareness increases said jan dawson an analyst at jackdaw research virtual reality now appears to be headed for a phase in the evolution of new technologies known as the trough of disillusionment said sunny dhillon a venture capitalist at signia venture partners which has invested in virtual reality according to the technology research firm gartner this stage of the hype cycle for new technologies comes after a period of inflated expectations but before a phase in which their benefits become commonly accepted the excitement around virtual reality took a huge leap in march 2014 when facebook announced it planned to acquire oculus for 2 billion and the social network s chief executive mark zuckerberg suggested that virtual reality could be the next big thing in technology after mobile that deal sparked a wave of creating products for virtual reality and a related technology called augmented reality which overlays digital imagery on a view of the real world as seen through smartphones and headsets last year 1 48 billion was invested in in that category compared with 331 million the prior year estimated pitchbook a financial data firm many of those were funded before major headsets went on sale to the public entrepreneurs raising money in the future are likely to encounter tougher questions about what kind of use their products are getting all the major headsets have launched the numbers are coming in said alex rosenfeld the founder of vrideo a that acted as a hub for virtual reality videos you re going to have some companies here that don t survive if the industry is going to continue to attract dollars there s going to have to be real numbers vrideo was one of those that did not make it mr rosenfeld announced at the end of november that he was shutting the company down he said investors were skeptical about whether vrideo could compete against larger players like google s youtube and facebook not pessimistic about the overall future of virtual reality the companies that make the major headsets do not report their sales and all of them said they were pleased with the results so far superdata research a technology research firm estimated that oculus had sold 360 000 headsets and htc 450 000 since their products went on sale in march and june respectively both of those headsets require pcs with powerful processors the firm estimated that sony which began selling a virtual reality headset in october has sold about 750 000 sony s headset was seen as a potentially big boost to the virtual reality industry because it is less expensive than rival headsets and relies on a playstation 4 console more than 53 million of which have already been sold a bundle with the playstation vr headset and specialized controllers sells for 500 while comparable bundles from htc and oculus sell for just under 800 each less expensive sony and oculus headsets are available without controllers designed for virtual reality still the sony sales were fewer than superdata and others had expected the holidays were pretty disappointing for many in the industry said doug renert a venture capitalist with tandem capital i m not all that surprised in a bright spot samsung said last week at ces that is had shipped more than five million of its gear vr headsets which act as a cradle for a mobile phone with lenses that create a image from the phone s screen samsung often runs promotions in which it gives away a headset with the purchase of a samsung smartphone price drops on technology are likely to be a big factor in mainstream acceptance of virtual reality starting monday a company that makes gaming pcs cyberpower will begin selling a 499 computer that can play virtual reality content when used with an oculus headset that is hundreds of dollars less than the normal cost ergonomic challenges with virtual reality headsets are likely to take longer to overcome the more powerful headsets must be tethered by thick cables to pcs or consoles which can tangle up players legs when these rigs occlude their view of the real world some players have come up with clever solutions to this problem by repurposing ikea lamps to dangle the cables above their heads at ces a called sixa showed a wireless adapter called rivvr that eliminates the need for those cables with wireless v r will be ready for the mass market said mykola minchenko chief executive of sixa which plans to sell its adapter for 200 mr renert the venture capitalist said his firm had invested in several working in virtual reality including sixa despite slow sales of headsets though the companies are working on technologies in other categories too he is confident that virtual reality will one day be a mainstream technology comparing its evolution to devices from apple that were flops and hits we re not at the newton stage but i don t think we re at iphone

       " 'dublin an assembly of irish citizens convened by parliament is considering changes to one of the most divisive policies in the country the ban on abortions which has been enshrined in ireland s constitution since 1983 the group a citizens assembly led by mary laffoy a supreme court judge does not have the power to change the law but its mandate from parliament to examine the full range of medical legal and ethical issues surrounding abortion suggests a willingness to revisit the ban one of the most stringent in the western world over the last three months the assembly has received more than 13 500 comments from the public more than 1 000 of which have been published online so far it pored over these submissions at the grand hotel malahide over the weekend along with testimony from experts and is scheduled to issue a report later this year abortion was already illegal in ireland before 1983 but the eighth amendment gave the right to life of the unborn equal status to the right to life of the mother under the constitution the amendment was enacted through a voter referendum and can be altered or abandoned only via another referendum several highly publicized cases since then have contributed to and reflected a shift in the public s mood however in 2012 a woman savita halappanavar died from septic shock while having a miscarriage after a hospital denied her an abortion that might have saved her life and last year a united nations committee ruled that ireland had violated a woman s rights by forcing her to travel abroad for an abortion even though severe congenital defects had been diagnosed in the fetus legal uncertainty over how to define the unborn has long dogged the amendment and the assembly was seen as one response to the panel s criticisms it is common for women in ireland to travel to countries such as britain and the netherlands for abortions figures from britain s national health service showed that more than 3 400 women gave irish addresses to british abortions clinics in 2015 that said ireland remains a conservative society and the roman catholic church opposes any change in the law we believe that every unborn child irrespective of his or her medical condition or the circumstances of his or her birth has the right to be treated equally before the law the bishops conference said in a statement submissions posted online expressed a wide range of views with many of them offering deeply personal perspectives leslie spillane a woman in her 20s from cork in southwestern ireland wrote that several of her friends had traveled abroad to terminate their pregnancies these friends of mine are also the lucky ones they have been able to borrow the money for the travel and they have had friends they could tell she wrote abortions happen everyday making them illegal doesn t stop woman needing or wanting them or inflicting them on themselves there will always be coat hangers broken bottles painkillers stairs to fall down fists to hit medicines to swallow in a phone interview she said that even if you don t agree with abortion it s not morally acceptable to force your views onto others defenders of the law were equally adamant abortion in our firm belief is the taking of human life irrespective of the stage of pregnancy wrote kathleen gleeson and her husband raymond gleeson from county kerry in southwestern ireland valerie marjoram a woman in her 30s in county kildare just west of dublin described herself as a feminist who opposed abortion on religious grounds i find it appalling that a certain brand of feminism would put more effort into obtaining the legal sanction of murdering one s own child than fighting for the right to carry a child to term without losing one s pay career path promotion college place she said in a phone interview the fact that abortion is legal in any country has led to a culture of selfishness where even life can be rescheduled if it happens at the wrong time the eighth amendment has been subject to legal and political challenges over the years in 1992 ireland s highest court upheld the right to an abortion if the mother s life is at risk including from suicide but how to interpret that right remains in dispute in 1992 voters approved an amendment to the constitution to allow women to travel abroad for abortions and to receive information about abortion services abroad and in that year and again in 2002 voters rejected amendments that would have removed the threat of suicide as grounds for a legal abortion conor o mahony a lecturer in law at university college cork says the continued contentiousness reveals problems with the wording of the ban the eighth amendment doesn t work as a means of regulating abortion whether you are coming from the or abortion rights perspective he said in a phone interview and the evidence i would give you is that neither side has ever been happy with how that amendment has been interpreted and applied over the years he said that public opinion had been gradually shifting in favor of legalizing abortion particularly in cases involving severe fetal abnormalities or rape but predicted that the debate would continue for years even if a referendum was to take place in the near future gerard whyte a professor of law at trinity college dublin said in a phone interview that it would be unwise to simply repeal the amendment as some advocates seek if there is no constitutional protection for the unborn then there is a problem and we re into uncharted territory he said i m simply warning about a situation whereby people decide to repeal the eighth but don t add anything else ',\n",
       " 'in an effort to give back to his hometown community in florida carol city the star rick ross decided to fulfill a childhood dream he bought a checkers franchise why a checkers one reason seemed to rise above them all the no 1 fries in the game mr ross says in a video released in december the video shows mr ross driving around town in his ford truck puffing cigars and relating stories from his childhood in the downtrodden community which is in the miami area at a certain point mr ross begins talking about the burger joint he frequented as a teenager across the thoroughfare from the carwash where he worked there was a mcdonald s that was closer but checkers he says was more affordable i made 30 a day from 8 in the morning to 8 at night mr ross says i went to checkers checkers does not typically pursue celebrity endorsements but when mr ross applied to purchase the carol city franchise last summer he seemed so genuine in his affection for the chain that checkers recognized a marketing opportunity as straightforward as a still it did not want a typical campaign scott wakeman director of marketing for checkers restaurants inc and the company s ad firm fitzgerald company in atlanta turned to the digital media upstart woven digital the firm has heavy traction among mr ross s primary audience young men on the entertainment sites that it owns like uproxx dime and brobible woven has also specialized in productions that on the surface do not feel like ads to mr wakeman it seemed like a perfect way to take advantage of mr ross s charisma and authenticity it just felt like such a unique opportunity he said the video which is 3 minutes 31 seconds long was filmed over two days in carol city in late september mostly as mr ross drove his truck around spliced in is footage of pickup basketball games and bikers popping wheelies the first mention of checkers comes about halfway through the video checkers invests the bulk of its annual marketing budget about 20 million in standard television spots mr wakeman said by contrast the rick ross ad has been distributed only on social media channels and uproxx but mr wakeman said he believed the unusual authenticity of the video and the compelling way mr ross related his story would resonate with viewers more than anything checkers had tried in the past we don t think of it as an advertisement mr wakeman said adding of mr ross we wanted to create a piece of content that captured his love for the brand last year woven teamed up with millercoors on a series of short documentary videos that profiled entrepreneurs with expertise in making items like watches and surfboards or in one case doing calligraphy the series sponsored by coors banquet beer and run across uproxx was intended to reach an audience that has become adept at avoiding traditional advertising according to brad feinberg senior director of media and digital marketing for millercoors it was a success receiving more than 33 million views this is content that people want to see they re intrigued by it they seek it out mr feinberg said and putting it in long form is something you can do in the digital space that is very cost prohibitive in other places storytelling might sound incompatible with the attention spans of millennials but it can have its advantages young men in particular have demonstrated a willingness to sit through longer pieces of content if it aligns with their values and gives them something of value in return said leah swartz senior content specialist for futurecast a part of the barkley agency of kansas city mo that focuses on research into millennials her team considers this a rewriting of the old abcs of sales rather than the mantra always be closing brands must now think about how they can always be helping you have to think about helping your consumer what you re providing what benefits you re giving how you re making their lives more fulfilled ms swartz said for checkers turning a story about a hit rapper s upbringing into a selling point for hamburgers and chicken wings was a bit of a gamble mr wakeman said in the video there are only a couple of references to checkers products such as mr ross s unequivocal praise of the french fries but mr wakeman said the documentary format allowed mr ross s true voice to shine through food and value are our two big brand pillars and i think they come through in the spot in a cool way mr wakeman said it wasn t a script it was just rick talking about what he loves about the place the video also captures moments of spontaneity the producers originally intended just to film mr ross outside the checkers but on the way there he sent out a message on instagram offering free burgers to any fans who wanted to meet him in carol city about 200 people showed up and the cameras rolled as he shook hands and ripped open bags of food benjamin blank the chief executive of woven said the company was not trying to conceal that the video was an advertisement but he said he thought the content itself was meaningful and captivating enough that viewers ultimately would not mind being sold to there were plenty of things rick could have gotten involved with from a business standpoint mr blank said but his reason for getting involved with checkers was a great story ',\n",

what were their demands many of the men seemed not to know they hung around the food trucks and milled about the parking lots unsure why they had stopped working and unsure what it would take for work to resume no one knew what that was about one recalled recently a year later the reason for the strike remains unclear even as the agency tasked with ridding the waterfront of organized crime the waterfront commission has questioned dozens of longshoremen under oath one told the commission he learned of the strike early that morning when it was too dark to see the face of the man giving the order it could have been anyone it was the old d d deaf and dumb the classic longshoreman s response popularized in the 1954 film on the waterfront in that movie the longshoremen were reluctant even frightened to talk to the authorities whether a priest or a detective because the mob controlled the waterfront in the years since much has changed around new york harbor the heavy lifting is done not by hand but by cranes and human voices are scarcely heard amid the beeping of the straddle carriers giant insectlike machines that move containers back and forth but even as new york and new jersey s

is up for a job where the nephew of another famous mobster pulled down more than 400 000 in a single year because he was almost never off the clock not even when he was at home sleeping where three consecutive presidents of a newark longshoremen s union were convicted of extortion there is physical evidence as well like the 51 900 wrapped in cellophane that was discovered buried in the backyard of a longshoreman it was according to federal agents in a 2010 affidavit the tribute that a group of newark longshoremen paid the genovese crime family each christmas you will need another generation or two to get the mob out of this port because they are very well entrenched said one longshoreman who requested anonymity because of a concern for his safety and his livelihood those who step out of line he said face being reassigned from jobs unloading container ships to the cruise ship terminals where the work and the pay is far less while investigators say the mob and the waterfront remain entwined both institutions are much diminished today pushed to the margins of new york city the finger piers that once extended from much of manhattan and brooklyn are mostly gone these days the most famous shipping line in the city is the circle line which does sightseeing tours container ships generally head across the harbor to new jersey toward the ports of elizabeth newark and bayonne they unload at a number of terminals one of which is owned by a canadian teachers pension fund the pay is pretty good on the docks plenty of longshoremen make well over 100 000 but the work is often dreary and dangerous it s a funny thing about this port a hiring agent at port newark named pasquale pontoriero was overheard saying in a 2009 wiretap a few years before his license was revoked because he had associated with organized crime figures i call it the broadway of broken dreams perhaps the starkest difference at the port today is in how many machines there are and how few people a century ago new york harbor employed 40 000 longshoremen who unloaded ships with hook and sling and brawn today the entire workforce is just under 3 400 longshoremen many perched behind the controls of cranes and straddle carriers yet amid all the transformation some investigators say racketeers and mobsters are still as present as the barnacles attached to the piers in the view of walter m arsenault the executive director of the waterfront commission the fundamental relationship between the waterfront and the mob remains unchanged since on the waterfront the only difference is now it s in color mr arsenault said he based that assessment on several indicators such as the number of relatives of figures who continue to hold choice jobs many of which involve little work and pay unusually high salaries like the union shop steward position held by ralph gigante the nephew of the boss of the genovese family the late vincent chin gigante ralph gigante earned 419 000 in 2014 and has said he believes he holds the union office for life until death do us part there is also the fact that some of the same new york and new jersey union officials whom federal prosecutors have in the past accused of racketeering have since risen to the top ranks of the east coast waterfront union the international longshoremen s association one is harold j daggett the garrulous president who owns a yacht the obsession and has been spotted by his members riding in a bentley one longshoreman said he had been surprised to catch sight of a holster strapped to mr daggett s ankle during a meeting the justice department which has lost two cases against mr daggett has described him as an associate of the genovese crime family whose rise through the union ranks was part of the mob s plan a good portion of the justice department s evidence against him came from the testimony of an aged mob turncoat george barone who had once been a waterfront enforcer for the genovese family and who described mr daggett as thoroughly under the mob s control but mr daggett on trial in 2005 took the witness stand and portrayed himself as a mob target describing a 1980 episode in which mr barone had put a gun to his head and threatened to kill him and his family an incident that so terrified mr daggett he urinated in his pants according to news accounts during that trial one of mr daggett s a reputed mobster named lawrence ricci went missing several weeks after the men were acquitted mr ricci s decomposing body was found in the trunk of a car outside a new jersey diner the murder which mr arsenault said is the last known waterfront killing remains unsolved mr daggett declined through the longshoremen s association s spokesman to be interviewed but alluding to his brushes with the justice department mr daggett joked at a union conference in puerto rico in 2015 that when he was invited to the white house for a labor meeting i thought i might have a better chance ending up in the big house but there i was your i l a president at the white house but mr daggett s lawyer in that 2005 trial george daggett his cousin said in a recent interview that the mob on the waterfront is a myth something that has not been true for half a century mr daggett who frequently represents longshoremen in litigation with the waterfront commission said that the agency prefers to pretend we re still in the 50s they can t say we got rid of the mob because then there s no reason for them to be in existence george daggett said i challenge them to prove mob influence on the piers what have they come up with a couple of guys here and a stray guy there the mob s grip over the new york waterfront began nearly a century ago and was predicated on a few simple facts the work was uneven depending on a ship s arrival time and yet the cargo needed to be unloaded quickly so that produce did not spoil and the shelves of america s stores could remain stocked gangsters quickly realized that the piers were the choke point of the economy and that a dizzying array of rackets were available to them they pilfered cargo as it came ashore and extorted truckers who had come to collect cargo or drop it off and most cruelly the mob controlled which of the longshoreman would be selected to work theirs was some of the most dangerous work in the country but longshoremen had to beg to get it at the on the piers where longshoremen would gather each morning in the hope of joining the group that would work on an arriving ship it was common for a man to place a toothpick behind his ear a signal that he would kick back some of his pay all this began to change with containerization as goods were no longer shipped loose but packed into containers that stacked efficiently and transferred easily between ships and trucks and trains with cranes doing the lifting the number of longshoremen plummeted by more than 90 percent today advances in automation threaten to reduce the number of longshoremen even further as the workforce dwindled the remaining jobs became well paid this was a result of a shrewd move by the longshoremen s association the union negotiated a flat fee today roughly 5 a ton that the shipping industry would pay into various funds to provide an income for longshoremen and supplement the benefits and income of those who would work fewer hours as a result as global trade has soared the few longshoremen who remain have seen their paychecks grow the waterfront today has largely receded from the city s consciousness and even its geography and to some extent so has the mob decimated by mass prosecutions over the last three decades new york s five crime families have struggled to adapt while there have been some new profitable ventures like online gambling the waterfront still exerts its own pull mr arsenault referred to the waterfront as the mob s last candy jar in recent years the union has brazenly recommended friends or relatives of organized crime figures for jobs on the docks said phoebe s sorial the general counsel for the waterfront commission she said the union has sought waterfront jobs for people who posted bail for organized figures and people who are in business with organized crime figures along with any number of relatives in 2014 for instance the union recommended the daughter of one of new york s most famous mobsters benjamin lefty ruggiero played by al pacino in the film donnie brasco mr arsenault said adding that other such cases abound you can t throw a rock on either side of the waterfront without hitting a brother son or daughter of a made member mr arsenault said using the terminology for someone who has been inducted into a crime family the waterfront commission was formed in 1953 to fight organized crime on the docks for many years before it came under new leadership in 2008 it was a and sleepy agency since then it has focused on extensive background checks mapping the familial relationships between mobsters and longshoremen an elaborate genealogy project the gigantes for instance have 10 relatives mostly nephews and grandsons working on the waterfront according to the commission this kind of blatant nepotism was impressive if not especially unusual and yet mr daggett the union president objects to the assumption that these sorts of arrangements necessarily signal corruption there is an old saying he once proclaimed at a public hearing slightly stretching the degree of kinship in the adage the son or a nephew should not carry the sins of a father or an uncle many of those with relatives in organized crime say the insinuation that they themselves are mixed up in racketeering is hurtful untrue and yet maybe inescapable when i started out people were a little standoffish because of fear because of my ancestors james anastasio said his father s uncle was albert anastasia once the head of what the press called murder inc he was lord high executioner as his 1957 obituary in the daily news put it although once they got to know me and realized i had nothing to do with that they treated me as a normal person mr anastasio who runs a training institute for longshoremen and is also an executive at a crane company said that in his long career on the waterfront i ve never really come across the mob as far as i know no the mob is no longer on the waterfront he added i can t say there are not small pockets of bad people but as far as big influence not that i ve seen in my lifetime george daggett the lawyer and cousin of the union president said that the waterfront commission has taken to harassing some longshoremen with relatives reputed to be organized crime figures he cited a lawsuit he had brought on behalf of a longshoreman in new jersey named pasquale falcetti jr mr falcetti he said was denied a port registration card by the waterfront commission for no other reason apparently than who this kid s father is pasquale uncle patty falcetti a convicted racketeer and reputed leader in the genovese family currently finishing a federal prison sentence the union has complained about such aggressive tactics and the longstanding antipathy between the longshoremen s association and the waterfront commission may have been the driving force behind the strike last year and yet a spokesman for the longshoremen s association james mcnamara said the union did not give the order for the strike and urged the longshoremen to return to work what we had heard mr mcnamara said was the men were seemingly protesting against the waterfront commission and what was perceived as harassment as for the presence of organized crime along the waterfront mr mcnamara said the mob had no influence anymore they just don t he said it s a highly automated highly sophisticated industry he added you just don t hear about that at all anymore but another viewpoint was offered two years ago by sabato sal catucci a legendary waterfront figure who operated the stevedoring company that ran the red hook docks in brooklyn until 2011 at a public hearing before the waterfront commission in 2010 he protested investigators insinuation that the ports were under mob control he was so wary of being tarred as a mobster that he even chose what to wear with care i didn t come in here with a black shirt today because i don t feel that i wanted to be stereotyped he said yet just a few years later mr catucci now locked in a battle over a contract to operate the red hook port accused the longshoremen s union of threatening him during negotiations he had been told he would be taken out in a box according to a lawsuit he filed one vice president of the union shoved me and threatened to knock me out mr catucci said in a 2014 affidavit in which he claimed that some of the waterfront s most powerful figures are or are associated with thugs who get their way by intimidation and force investigators insist that the same rackets that gave life to on the waterfront continue today mr arsenault checked off the various forms of thievery and extortion both big and small that he learned of through his investigations containers occasionally disappear most likely the result of theft truckers in order to be allowed to retrieve their container and leave the port have been encouraged to buy overpriced bottles of water or even girl scout cookies from the longshoremen he said robert stewart a longtime anticorruption prosecutor who until last year had worked in a role for 13 years to rid a longshoremen s local in bayonne of organized crime said that mob influence on the waterfront was a tad better than in the past you don t have bodies showing up he said but he said he wondered whether the mob had not simply directed its attention to a different source of income for years investigators have suspected that the mob s most lucrative targets on the waterfront are the longshoremen benefit funds including what is known as the container royalty fund the fund that pays extra wages to longshoremen each year as compensation for the diminished work that came with containerization the funds are worth a great deal of money one received more than 95 million in 2014 they also tend to be rather opaque it is an awfully inviting target and knowing the cast of characters involved here to think they re not getting a piece of this is unrealistic mr stewart said the list of employees at the benefits fund said one law enforcement official include an accountant and a director of operations who are the children of dead organized crime figures but john nardi the president of the new york shipping association a trade group that has a role in managing the funds said he had seen no evidence of misconduct based on people s names you can make a lot of assumptions he said however he said all monies are accounted for ',\n",
       " 'times insider delivers insights into life at the new york times in a large newsroom the collaboration between a reporter and a photographer often depends on the whims of their respective assigning editors who calculate strengths weaknesses and most of all availability who s up to cover that fire who s up to shoot it the resulting slapdash teamwork between writer and photographer can end as quickly as it began they may work together the next day or never again but for many years now i have been fortunate to work with exceptional new york times photographers for extended periods of time while writing a national column called this land lately i have been collaborating with todd heisler a stunningly gifted photographer and a great companion before todd i traveled for several years beside the recently retired nicole bengiveno whose profound empathy comes through in her camera s every click and who deserves some formal commendation for having put up with a certain hack me for so long and before nicole there was ángel franco who retired last month to end a storied times career and who began the this land column with me 10 years ago this month the template for our relationship indeed for this land was established in early 2007 as we headed out to do our inaugural column one on logan a small west virginia city struggling with a fatal mine disaster and the decline of king coal mr franco and i began by walking the streets noticing the coal train running through the city s core the dust settling on buildings along the tracks and the jesus christ carved from anthracite prominent in a store s window display noticing that was the word for it at one point we went to a small diner and engaged in a brief exchange with the waitress after she had taken our order i asked did you hear what she said and mr franco repeated her words exactly are we ready yet children there it was as with todd and nicole as with so many other photographers and may god forgive any reporter who uses the term my photographer mr franco is an attentive observer witnessing and listening always in that diner i knew that my times colleague embraced the storytelling worth of the small and quiet moment this is going to be fun i thought for the next two years mr franco and i produced a column a week just about and wound up filing dispatches from each of the 50 states this of course was madness our weeks would often begin on monday at newark liberty international airport and end on friday or saturday even sunday with frantic efforts to figure out where to go to next louisiana montana maine the only way we were able to maintain some semblance of sanity by the way was by having the great cate doty help us with possible story ideas travel logistics and dinner recommendations she was a full partner in this misbegotten venture i also owe a debt of gratitude to then national desk editor suzanne daley and then deputy national editor david firestone both of whom were integral in allowing this land to begin you can look it up we went to a retirement home in penney farms fla to visit the coroner in the wizard of oz to havana ill to report on the asian carp infesting the illinois river to kalaupapa hawaii to meet the last residents of a colony to which those with leprosy also known as hansen s disease were once relegated to nashville to witness an execution by electric chair to bethel alaska to explore the games of bootleggers to bill wyo population five maybe to stay in a new hotel catering to railway workers to cottage grove wis to meet the pastor who baptized jeffrey

odd fellows where we felt perfectly at home kalispell mont lake mead nev ainsworth neb newport ind pascagoula miss greensburg kan hollywood md sylva n c the datelines blur into one american story captured in all its breadth by mr franco and his camera i often had no idea what to do for the next column one saturday morning while scanning online newspapers for ideas i noticed a news brief about a farewell breakfast in a v f w hall in mohave valley ariz for a high school graduate named resha kane after the meal she was to be taken by motorcycle escort to las vegas to catch a flight to fort hood where she would begin her army career in exchange for college tuition i called my good friend mr franco who of course got it immediately we flew out the next day and were present when ms kane who looked much younger than her 18 years said her goodbyes mr franco s memorable photograph of this young woman in fatigues saying goodbye to her father the fear of her unknown of our unknown conveyed in her eyes hangs in the newsroom once again he had noticed and captured that small and quiet moment working closely with mr franco for two years i could not help but be blown away by his fierce dedication to his art by his determination to capture a moment s essence and by his unflagging reportorial curiosity which led to my favorite moments on assignment the evening debriefing sitting in a booth at a chili s or texas roadhouse hard against some interstate mr franco and i would pore over what we had just seen and heard comparing notes dissecting motives framing the story to come one modest testament to mr franco s art is in how i remember our travels it s not my opening paragraphs or closing kickers that i recall but rather mr franco s photographs which return me so completely to the mississippi despair of a fema trailer to the joy of a small maine amusement park to the expansive wonder of a remote south dakota spot known as the center of the nation it is a rare privilege to

       " 'as is so often the case the party doesn t really get going until everybody is good and drunk then after much wine vodka and awkward conversation comes a fabulous eruption of runaway hedonism maybe you think coming to this shindig wasn t such a bad idea after all you ve known such moments surely when the spectacle of people going stark raving wild carries its own irresistible anarchic logic a feeling of vital connection saturates the room like the fizz from an exploded bottle of champagne alas the thrill is a lonely cascade of fireworks in a night of damp squibs and the briefly beautifully animated revelers go back to being their soggy miserable selves that s what happens in terms of both plot and performance toward the end of the first half of the present the sydney theater company s sprawling and confused adaptation of a sprawling and confused play written by a young anton chekhov this fitful australian import which opened on sunday night at the barrymore theater chronicles the bad behavior at one birthday celebration the mistress of these revels i am happy to report is the extraordinary screen star cate blanchett making a broadway debut ms blanchett is portraying the hostess and birthday girl anna a ravishing widow who is unhappily turning 40 ms blanchett knows how to hold a stage and if necessary hijack it her performances in a streetcar named desire at the brooklyn academy of music and uncle vanya at new york city center both for the sydney theater company were as brilliant as they were brave such commanding charisma is useful if you re attempting to hold together a badly assembled party or for that matter play but here ms blanchett s inventiveness is as sorely taxed as that of her character anna s party turns into the kind of disaster that ends not only in tears but also bloodshed this production on the other hand feels moribund from the beginning frantic attempts at resuscitation by ms blanchett and her valiant leading man and unforgettable in uncle vanya a tireless richard roxburgh as a hapless homme fatale only occasionally succeed in eliciting a pulse the present which has been adapted by andrew upton ms blanchett s husband and directed by john crowley is the chekhov play that almost got away though the scholarship on its origins is uncertain it appears that chekhov began writing it as an student and it exudes a youthful passionate untidiness its manuscript a whopper in length wasn t published until nearly two decades after his death an uncut version would take at least five hours this one is three the eminent playwrights michael frayn and david hare among others have done their best to domesticate this shaggy behemoth mr frayn reconceived it as an elegant sex farce under the title wild honey seen briefly on broadway in the while mr hare s adaptation hewed closer to the more brooding tragicomic template usually associated with chekhov that version is called platonov and i saw a fine production of it at london s national theater last summer directed by jonathan kent it was set in the period in which it was written and the vestiges of decorum served as an appropriately chafing corset for the flabby plot mr upton drags the story out of the twilight of the czars and into the morning after of the as in the original script it s a period of profound uneasiness when a nation s future is murky and its citizens unsure of their roles but despite the inclusion of several soliloquies on recent russian history it s hard to comprehend what they re reacting against here exit the robber barons and the real aristocrats enter the oligarchs and their murderous henchmen farewell balalaikas hello the clash as for those without a fixed part in the new scheme of things they re the same old kvetchers of yore doomed to circular philosophizing and drinking chief among these is mikhail platonov mr roxburgh a provincial schoolteacher of vaulting wit and unfulfilled aspirations he knew anna when she was the young trophy wife of a powerful general now dead it s at the general s summer dacha rendered with all the personality of an ikea showroom by the show s designer alice babidge that anna has chosen to celebrate her birthday her guests include her stepson sergei chris ryan who as a youth was best friends with nikolai toby schmitz and mikhail who is married to nikolai s sister sasha susan prior though mikhail is a bloviator a womanizer and a mean drunk sasha loves her husband so more problematically do all the other women in the play who in addition to the patrician anna include sergei s wife sophia jacqueline mckenzie a humanitarian physician and nikolai s girlfriend maria anna bamford it s hard to fathom the attraction but apparently once you ve had your first whiff of him mikhail is as addictive and dangerous as crack cocaine maybe it s because he s livelier and more subversive than the other guys who include anna s rich older suitors alexei martin jacobs and yegor david downer but like most of his contemporaries mikhail can t stop talking about how directionless his life is such flailing is common in chekhov but usually you understand the specific idiosyncratic places his characters are coming from in this version everyone seems to be flailing interchangeably in the same stale vacuum for all eternity setting the play s third section in what looks like a dreamscape only compounds the impression ms blanchett does bring colorful shades of excitement to being bored her anna plays a great game of dramatically uninterested chess and her response to a rambling speech by mikhail at the lunch table is priceless hint it involves the removal of an undergarment that comes just before that bacchanal i wrote about earlier it s one of the most memorable party sequences i ve ever seen a volcanic channeling of a displaced class s fear anger and disgust these people want to blow up their world and in a way they do most

       " 'on the night of nov 16 a group of executives gathered in a private dining room of the restaurant la chine at the waldorf astoria hotel in midtown manhattan the table was laden with chinese delicacies and 2 100 bottles of château lafite rothschild at one end sat wu xiaohui the chairman of the waldorf s owner anbang insurance group a chinese financial behemoth with estimated assets of 285 billion and an ownership structure shrouded in mystery close by sat jared kushner a major new york real estate investor whose donald j trump had just been elected president of the united states it was a mutually auspicious moment mr wu and mr kushner who is married to mr trump s daughter ivanka and is one of his closest advisers were nearing agreement on a joint venture in manhattan the redevelopment of 666 fifth avenue the fading crown jewel of the kushner family empire anbang which has close ties to the chinese state has seen its aggressive efforts to buy up hotels in the united states slowed amid concerns raised by obama administration officials who review foreign investments for national security risk now according to two people with knowledge of the mr wu toasted mr trump and declared his desire to meet the whose ascension he was sure would be good for global business since the election intense scrutiny has been trained on mr trump s company and the potential conflicts of interest he will face but with mr kushner laying the groundwork for his own white house role the meeting at the waldorf shines a light on his family s business kushner companies and on the ethical thicket he would have to navigate while advising his on policy that could affect his bottom line unlike the trump organization which has shifted its focus from acquisition to branding of the trump name the kushner family business led by mr kushner is a major real estate investor across the new york area and beyond the company has participated in roughly 7 billion in acquisitions in the last decade many of them backed by opaque foreign money as well as financial institutions mr kushner s will soon have a hand in regulating the anbang talks which have not previously been reported began roughly six months ago well before the s victory mr kushner s spokeswoman risa heller noted that was however just as mr trump clinched the republican nomination while the talks are far along representatives for mr kushner said some points remained unresolved ms heller declined to outline the financial terms under discussion mr kushner who declined to be interviewed for this article has hired a leading washington law firm wilmerhale to advise him on how to comply with federal ethics laws should he join the white house staff as an adviser to the president the firm has concluded that one potential sticking point a federal law is not applicable though not all ethics experts agree while the law prohibits federal officials from hiring relatives for agencies they lead mr kushner s lawyers argue among other things that the white house is not an agency and is therefore exempt as for conflicts of interest mr kushner would be required to make limited financial disclosures which could give the public a clearer picture of his holdings and unlike mr trump who as president will be exempt from laws he would have to recuse himself from decisions with a direct and predictable effect on his financial interests jamie s gorelick a wilmerhale partner who served in the clinton administration said that while plans were not final mr kushner was taking significant steps to extricate himself from the family business mr kushner is committed to complying with federal ethics laws and we have been consulting with the office of government ethics regarding the steps he would take she said he will resign as chief executive of kushner companies and though the law does not require it she said he would divest substantial assets she did not name them but ms heller said they would include his stake in 666 fifth avenue just how meaningful that plan is remains to be seen mr kushner s representatives declined to detail his personal financial interest in kushner companies properties and they said he intended to keep his interest in other properties beyond 666 fifth avenue he also has a stake through a family investment vehicle in a private equity firm run by his brother joshua with investments of its own mr kushner who turns 36 on tuesday has emerged as one of the most powerful figures in mr trump s orbit already he is involved in steering policy making personnel choices and serving as the middleman between foreign leaders the white house and the in ways that could affect his business even as companies like anbang see opportunity in entering into new ventures with the s mr kushner played a pivotal role in persuading mr trump who made the wall street powerhouse goldman sachs a bête noire of his presidential campaign to appoint the firm s president gary d cohn as his chief economic adviser according to several people involved in the transition like a number of people interviewed for this article they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal matters goldman sachs has lent the kushner companies money and is an investor in a real estate technology company by mr kushner and his brother mr trump has said that his an orthodox jew will play a central role in dealings with israel describing him as so talented that he could help do peace in the middle east mr kushner s company has received multiple loans from israel s largest bank bank hapoalim the incoming trump administration will inherit a justice department investigation into allegations that the bank helped wealthy americans evade taxes indeed despite a lack of foreign policy experience mr kushner is emerging as an important figure at a crucial moment for some of america s most complicated diplomatic relationships such is his influence in the geopolitical realm that transition officials have told the obama white house that foreign policy matters that need to be brought to mr trump s attention should be relayed through his according to a person close to the transition and a government official with direct knowledge of the arrangement so when the chinese ambassador to the united states called the white house in early december to express what one official called china s deep displeasure at mr trump s break with longstanding diplomatic tradition by speaking by phone with the president of taiwan the white house did not call the s national security team instead it relayed that information through mr kushner whose company was not only in the midst of discussions with anbang but also has chinese investors ethics experts said that while the law is narrowly drawn mr kushner s mix of roles leads inevitably to ethical questions matthew t sanderson a lawyer at caplin drysdale and former general counsel to senator rand paul s presidential campaign said deals like the one with anbang might not be illegal under the rules but raise a strong appearance that a foreign entity is using mr kushner s business to try to influence u s policy without knowing details of mr kushner s holdings and divestiture plans he said the merits of his proposal are hard to assess even if he divests his stake in certain properties mr sanderson added it strikes me as a that still poses a real issue and would be a drag on mr trump s presidency and cause the american people to question mr kushner s role in policy making like the mr kushner built on the fortune of a successful father in the 1980s his father charles kushner took over the new construction business started by his own father a holocaust survivor from poland charles expanded into office buildings and apartments eventually assembling a 1 billion real estate business and becoming a leading democratic donor contributing to politicians in new jersey and new york and winning appointment to the board of the port authority of new york and new jersey but the company was upended when charles became engulfed in a nasty family feud over how the business s proceeds were to be distributed the fight which played out in a federal courthouse in newark resulted in a plea deal for charles who in 2005 was sentenced to two years in prison for tax evasion witness tampering and making illegal campaign donations the family infighting was so bitter that at one point charles hired a prostitute to seduce his videotaped the encounter and sent the footage to his sister jared 23 at the time of his father s conviction had recently graduated from harvard he was studying for an m b a and law degree at new york university in 2006 when he bought the new york observer at the time an influential weekly newspaper known for its coverage of the city s elite and real estate it is unclear exactly when he assumed control of the family business the company now says he became chief executive in 2008 but contemporaneous news accounts rarely describe him that way until 2012 nevertheless mr kushner quickly became the company s public face as it expanded across the hudson river into manhattan much as mr trump had left queens for the big city decades before charles kushner was released from federal custody in august 2006 he immediately resumed a significant role in the business and remains heavily involved today still it was with jared as headliner that the company soon made its biggest play ever 1 8 billion for the skyscraper at 666 fifth avenue that would remain at the center of its story to this day it was the highest price ever paid for a single office building in the united states and more than three times what its seller had paid six years earlier around this time mr kushner met the woman he would marry ivanka trump the headlines blared as the new york tabloids celebrated a match made in real estate heaven everything was looking up until suddenly it wasn t within a year after the deal the overheated lending market seized up and kushner companies struggled to repay its considerable loans and to hold on to 666 fifth avenue to the rescue over the next few years came the carlyle group a giant private equity firm vornado realty trust then a of two of mr trump s largest properties and inditex owner of zara the fashion retailer founded by amancio ortega the spanish tycoon who is one of the world s wealthiest men in the end mr kushner s company survived and he and ms trump became fixtures on the international circuit in august they were spotted with wendi deng an of rupert murdoch on the yacht rising sun owned by the entertainment mogul david geffen several weeks later they were photographed watching the united states open tennis finals with the art collector dasha zhukova wife of the russian oligarch roman abramovich a member of president vladimir v putin s inner circle since 2012 kushner companies has been on a buying spree it has acquired at least 120 properties mostly a mix of existing commercial and residential buildings in new york and new jersey according to data compiled by real capital analytics a research firm recent deals include the 340 million acquisition of the jehovah s witnesses headquarters in the shadow of the brooklyn bridge and 345 million for a nearby plot of undeveloped land mr kushner s company also bought several floors of the old new york times building for 295 million in 2015 from lev leviev an israeli who is chairman of one of the largest real estate development companies in russia increasingly the company is branching out across the country to philadelphia baltimore toledo ohio and kansas city mo in chicago it owns the building that houses the midwest headquarters of att in all the company owns more than 20 000 apartments and approximately 14 million square feet of office space as the kushners have expanded their businesses they have also by necessity expanded their universe of investors and creditors lenders have included private equity giants like blackstone the french bank natixis and goldman sachs another lender is deutsche bank which recently reached a 7 2 billion settlement with the justice department over its sale of toxic mortgage securities but it remains under investigation over allegations that it disguised trades that helped russian clients move money offshore beyond real estate mr kushner has moved into the wall street health care and tech spaces he has an indirect investment in thrive capital a venture capital firm valued at about 1 5 billion that is run by his brother joshua the company has made more than 100 investments in dozens of companies both in the united states and abroad among them is oscar a health insurance company founded in 2012 to take advantage of the affordable care act which mr trump has vowed to dismantle oscar s investors have included li who is one of hong kong s richest men and china s ping an insurance which has close ties to relatives of former prime minister wen jiabao of china the kushner brothers have counted the russian billionaire tech investor yuri milner and the chinese billionaire founder of alibaba jack ma as investors in another endeavor cadre a real estate investment company they started with a friend goldman sachs has invested in both tech ventures but the money behind many of mr kushner s investments remains a mystery while the company lists dozens of partners on its website it does not disclose the individuals behind those companies one of the newest kushner projects a luxury apartment tower that opened in november in jersey city got nearly a quarter of its financing about 50 million from chinese investors who are not publicly identified the investors are beneficiaries of a federal program that grants visas and a path to permanent residency in exchange for investments of 500 000 the program known as has become popular with real estate developers as a cheap form of financing in fiscal year 2015 the state department issued 9 764 of the visas overwhelmingly to applicants from china but the program which must be renewed periodically by congress has lately come under fire the government accountability office has issued several reports raising concerns about what it termed the program s insufficient background checks and lax safeguards against illicit financing one applicant the agency found failed to report potential financial ties to a string of chinese brothels then there are the kushners continuing negotiations with anbang s mr wu one of the most politically connected men in china in 2015 mr kushner began pursuing a grand vision for 666 fifth avenue the renowned architect zaha hadid was asked to come up with a design to resculpt the office building adding apartments a hotel and a mall and nearly tripling its height to 1 400 feet but the plan needed money and while mr kushner had managed to hang on to his family s flagship building it still had a lot of debt with a 1 1 billion loan coming due in 2019 and a good portion of the commercial office space vacant anbang which got its start as an auto insurance company in 2004 had become one of the most aggressive chinese buyers of united states real estate and had begun investing in hotels but it had encountered problems of its own its byzantine ownership structure had given rise to concern on wall street and in washington the times reported last year that anbang is owned by a few dozen companies which in turn are owned by a number of shell companies that are controlled by roughly 100 people many of whom have ties to a county in china that is the home of mr wu whose own power stems in part from marriage in his case he married zhuo ran a granddaughter of deng xiaoping the leader who brought china out of the chaos of the mao era mr wu also counts as a central business partner the son of a people s liberation army marshal and he has recruited several former government insurance regulators to serve on his board anbang s structure has stoked such suspicion about its true ownership that some wall street firms including morgan stanley have opted not to advise the company on united states mergers and acquisitions because they cannot get the information needed to satisfy their know your client guidelines anbang s deep ties to the chinese state have also led to a break in presidential protocol presidents have long stayed at the waldorf but when mr obama visited new york for the opening of a session of the united nations general assembly in september 2015 he decided to seek other accommodations american officials were vague about the reasons for the change at the time a senior national security official cited security counterintelligence and cybersurveillance concerns national security concerns have also complicated anbang s efforts to acquire other properties in the united states one deal to buy the hotel del coronado in san diego fell apart in october amid concerns from the committee on foreign investment in the united states which comprises the heads of nine federal agencies and is charged with reviewing the national security risks of transactions involving foreign governments or companies the hotel del coronado is near a naval base and deals involving proximity to national security infrastructure typically receive heightened scrutiny anbang was however able to acquire the other hotels in the same collection last year anbang tried to purchase the starwood hotels chain outbidding marriott with a 14 billion offer it was widely reported that the deal would be subject to review by the committee but though the parties expressed confidence that it would pass muster ultimately anbang walked away from the deal before submitting the kind of detailed inside information that process would entail and while anbang s planned 1 57 billion purchase of des fidelity guaranty life first announced in november 2015 was cleared by the committee also known as cfius it stalled after the new york state department of financial services demanded more information about anbang s shareholding structure but anbang was nothing if not savvy company officials had cultivated a relationship with benjamin m lawsky who had earlier led the financial services agency from may 2011 to june 2015 it was mr lawsky by then a consultant who introduced anbang to kushner companies according to people with knowledge of how the discussions came about mr lawsky declined to comment mr kushner led the negotiations his spokeswoman ms heller confirmed kushner companies would disclose little else about the joint venture except to say that anbang would become one of the equity partners in the building s redevelopment if an agreement is finalized anbang declined to comment it was just coincidence that mr kushner s nov 16 dinner at the waldorf with mr wu took place the week after the election ms heller said adding that it had been in the works for a while by the time of the meeting mr kushner had decided to hand off certain business relationships including the one with anbang to others at kushner companies according to ms heller and it was for that reason that he invited his father and laurent morali the president of kushner companies she said he planned to sell his stake in 666 fifth before the closing of any anbang deal but she declined to name the potential buyers or the price mr kushner hoped to get ms heller stressed in her statement that the united states has not found anbang to be a enterprise an important technical point given that the constitution s emoluments clause prohibits the acceptance of payments and gifts from foreign governments should it consummate its deal with anbang she said kushner companies will seek any necessary approvals from the federal government she expressed confidence that any deal would pass muster with the foreign investment committee citing the fact that it did not block the chinese company from buying the waldorf astoria come jan 20 when mr trump is scheduled to be inaugurated that committee will be made up of his cabinet members and the process is such that the president has the final say it is a process with which mr trump has some familiarity during the campaign he repeatedly criticized hillary clinton for supporting as secretary of state and member of the foreign investment committee a deal that benefited donors to her family s charitable foundation while giving the russians control of about 20 percent of america s capacity on china mr trump has talked a tough game accusing beijing of currency manipulation and raising the possibility of a trade war but whether that is only a negotiating tactic remains to be seen the has his own financial entanglements with china he owns a 30 percent stake in a partnership that owes roughly 950 million to a group of lenders that includes the bank of china and one of his biggest tenants at trump tower is another bank the industrial and commercial bank of china with anbang a magnet for controversy mr kushner has kept the negotiations under wraps but a week after the nov 16 dinner at the waldorf mr kushner s father and mr wu met at the hotel for lunch after the elder mr kushner departed mr wu was clearly elated i love you guys he exclaimed in english to his remaining entourage according to one person present ',\n",
       " 'washington the speed of republican efforts to repeal the affordable care act has stunned health industry lobbyists leaving representatives of insurance companies hospitals doctors and pharmaceutical makers in disarray and struggling for a response to a legislative quick strike that would upend much of the american health care system the senate is expected to take the first step by thursday morning approving parliamentary language in a budget resolution that would a repeal bill that could not be filibustered in the senate house and senate committees would have until jan 27 to report out repeal legislation health insurance and health care for millions of americans are at risk but far from reflecting the magnitude of the moment the most prominent message from lobbyists that lawmakers saw in their first week back at work was a narrowly focused advertisement from the u s chamber of commerce demanding the repeal of obamacare taxes especially an annual fee imposed on health insurance companies to help pay for the expansion of coverage under the health law more than 20 million people could lose their health insurance and states could lose billions of dollars in medicaid money said kenneth e raske the president of the greater new york hospital association but he added many health care executives don t want to get on the wrong side of the new administration or the republican majority in congress health care professionals are not totally silent but industries that were integral to the creation of the affordable care act in 2010 are keeping their voices down as republicans rush to dismantle it some republican lawmakers are openly fretting about their leaders repeal strategy saying they must develop an affordable care act replacement before they repeal it five republican senators proposed on monday to extend the deadline for drafting repeal legislation by five weeks until march 3 one of the five senator bob corker of tennessee said the extra time would allow congress and the trump administration to get the policy right as they try to arrange a smooth transition to a new system of health coverage but the naysayers are getting no cover from a major lobbying and advertisement blitz like the ones that blanketed the airwaves in 2009 and 2010 to block the repeal effort said senator richard j durbin of illinois the no 2 senate democrat we need two or three republicans to join us doctors are telling congress to proceed with caution insisting that no one should lose coverage the american college of physicians representing 148 000 specialists in internal medicine has sent letters to senators urging them to vote no this week on the budget resolution hospitals were expecting to receive tens of billions of dollars in additional revenue for treating people who were newly insured under the health law and they are alarmed at the prospect that it may now be repealed but they say if congress goes ahead and rolls back the expansion of coverage it must also restore tens of billions of dollars that the health law cut from medicare payments to hospitals top executives from state hospital associations will fly to washington this week to develop their strategy many also plan to visit offices on capitol hill where they will warn of the potential damage if congress repeals the health law without guaranteeing similar coverage for those who would lose it a coalition of consumers and liberal advocacy groups is spending more than 2 million on television advertisements urging congress to stop its attack on the law the ads by the alliance for healthcare security are aimed at a handful of republican senators including lisa murkowski of alaska jeff flake and john mccain of arizona susan collins of maine dean heller of nevada lamar alexander and mr corker of tennessee and shelley moore capito of west virginia but by washington standards that is a pittance pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america an industry lobbying group set aside 150 million in 2009 to support the law s passage some lobbyists have tacitly accepted the likelihood that major provisions of the health law will be repealed setting their sights instead on shaping its replacement they fear that if they come out strongly in opposition to repealing the law they will lose their seats at the table as congressional republicans and the trump administration negotiate a replacement for now passage of the budget resolution this week looks likely the real fight is expected to come two to three weeks from now when two house committees and two senate committees produce legislation to repeal the affordable care act and must answer to republicans who say a replacement measure must be ready at the same time at least a republican senators have expressed doubts about the republican leadership strategy of using the budget resolution to legislation to repeal the law with a delayed effective date to allow time to find a replacement in the future repeal and replacement should take place simultaneously mr corker said last week senator tom cotton of arkansas said on msnbc it would not be the right path for us to repeal obamacare without laying out a path forward members of the house freedom caucus are also pressing leaders to embrace a replacement bill before they eviscerate the existing law and that concern is not confined to congress gov john r kasich of ohio a republican has also warned congress against repealing the law without a replacement what he has asked will happen to the 700 000 people who have gained coverage under the expansion of medicaid in ohio senator rand paul republican of kentucky said that he spoke on friday with donald j trump and that mr trump agreed a replacement measure must be ready i think he consistently has said and i think many people who look at this say gosh you re going to repeal this huge dramatic thing and not have a replacement on the same day mr paul said on monday i mean doesn t make a lot of sense to do that many of the lobbyists who might have slowed the process appear flummoxed in part because they were expecting hillary clinton to win the election some companies anxious about changes in health policy said they were afraid to speak out because they feared that mr trump would attack them on twitter as he has badgered boeing ford general motors lockheed martin and toyota marilyn b tavenner the chief executive of the leading lobby for insurers america s health insurance plans is in a particularly awkward position as an obama administration official from 2010 to 2015 she led work on the health law issued rules to carry it out and often defended it on capitol hill in december 2015 speaker paul d ryan of wisconsin pointed to her as an example of how federal officials passed through a revolving door to work for companies they once regulated if the insurance industry does not understand how obamacare works why not hire the person who ran it mr ryan said in a gibe at ms tavenner that drew laughter from his audience at the library of congress ms tavenner said the requirement for people to have insurance the individual mandate was likely to be eliminated but she said to stabilize the market congress should maintain subsidies for and individuals to purchase insurance and financial help for plans that enroll individuals through at least jan 1 2019 she is also asking congress to kill the tax on insurers which has already been suspended for 2017 kaiser permanente the managed care company that serves more than 10 million people declined to comment specifically on republican plans to repeal the affordable care act instead it offered a statement of general principles saying that people should have access to health care and that we must continue to accommodate those who have conditions george c halvorson a former chief executive of kaiser permanente said insurers were guarded in their comments because the current environment was extremely politicized he predicted they have more to say when congress turns to the task of devising a replacement for the law you need to make your point when it will have optimal impact mr halvorson said lobbyists for the blue cross and blue shield association have been more active and outspoken they support changes to the health care law because they say premiums and deductibles are too high and commercial insurers have been dropping out of the public insurance marketplaces of counties in the united states have only one insurer offering coverage in the marketplace they say and in many cases it is a blue cross plan but blue cross lobbyists expressed alarm that congress or a federal court might eliminate the subsidies that the government pays insurers to reduce costs for people without these payments blue cross wrote in a primer delivered to congressional offices consumers will see significant premium increases in 2018 making coverage even more unaffordable for millions of working americans while defenders of the affordable care act try to figure out a strategy conservative groups are pressing hard for full repeal of the law as soon as possible among them are heritage action for america an offshoot of the heritage foundation and freedom partners a conservative group backed by the billionaire brothers charles g and david h koch ',\n",
       " 'many thousands of women are expected to converge on the nation s capital for the women s march on washington the day after donald j trump s inauguration jennifer willis no longer plans to be one of them ms willis a wedding minister from south carolina had looked forward to taking her daughters to the march then she read a post on the facebook page for the march that made her feel unwelcome because she is white the post written by a black activist from brooklyn who is a march volunteer advised white allies to listen more and talk less it also chided those who it said were only now waking up to racism because of the election you don t just get to join because now you re scared too read the post i was born scared stung by the tone ms willis canceled her trip this is a women s march she said we re supposed to be allies in equal pay marriage adoption why is it now about white women don t understand black women if all goes as planned the jan 21 march will be a momentous display of unity in protest of a president whose treatment of women came to dominate the campaign s final weeks but long before the first buses roll to washington and sister demonstrations take place in other cities contentious conversations about race have erupted nearly every day among marchers exhilarating some and alienating others in tennessee emotions ran high when organizers changed the name of the local march from women s march on to power together tennessee in solidarity with women s march on washington while many applauded the name change which was meant to signal the start of a new social justice movement in nashville some complained that the event had turned from a march for all women into a march for black women in louisiana the first state coordinator gave up her volunteer role in part because there were no minority women in leadership positions at that time i got a lot of flak locally when i stepped down from white women who said that i m alienating a lot of white women said candice huber a bookstore owner in new orleans who is white they said why do you have to be so divisive in some ways the discord is by design even as they are working to ensure a smooth and unified march next week the national organizers said they made a deliberate decision to highlight the plight of minority and undocumented immigrant women and provoke uncomfortable discussions about race this was an opportunity to take the conversation to the deep places said linda sarsour a muslim who heads the arab american association of new york and is one of four of the national march sometimes you are going to upset people the post that offended ms willis was part of that effort so was the quotation posted on the march s facebook page from bell hooks the black feminist about forging a stronger sisterhood by confronting the ways women through sex class and race dominated and exploited other women in response a new jersey woman wrote i m starting to feel not very welcome in this endeavor a debate then ensued about whether white women were just now experiencing what minority women experience daily or were having a hard time yielding control a young white woman from baltimore wrote with bitterness that white women who might have been victims of rape and abuse were being asked to check their privilege a catchphrase that refers to people acknowledging their advantages but which even some liberal women find unduly confrontational no one involved with the march fears that the rancor will dampen turnout even many of those who expressed dismay at the tone of the discussion said they still intended to join what is sure to be the largest demonstration yet against the trump presidency i will march one wrote on the march s facebook page hoping that someday soon a sense of unity will occur before it s too late but these debates over race also reflect deeper questions about the future of progressivism in the age of trump should the march highlight what divides women or what unites them is there room for women who have never heard of white privilege and at a time when a presidential candidate ran against political correctness and won with half of white female voters supporting him is this the time to tone down talk about race or to double down if your goal is to get as many people as possible at the march maybe you don t want to alienate people said anne valk the author of radical sisters a book about racial and class differences in the women s movement but if your goal is to use the march as a catalyst for progressive social and political change then that has to include thinking about race and class privilege the discord also reflects the variety of women s rights and liberal causes being represented at the march as well as a generational divide many older white women spent their lives fighting for rights like workplace protections that younger women now take for granted many young activists have spent years protesting police tactics and criminal justice policies issues they feel too many white liberals have ignored yes equal pay is an issue ms sarsour said but look at the ratio of what white women get paid versus black women and latina women for too long the march organizers said the women s rights movement focused on issues that were important to white women such as the ability to work outside the home and attain the same positions that men do but minority women they said have had different priorities black women who have worked their whole lives as maids might care more about the minimum wage or police brutality than about seeing a woman in the white house undocumented immigrant women might care about abortion rights they said but not nearly as much as they worry about being deported this brand of feminism frequently referred to as intersectionality asks white women to acknowledge that they have had it easier it speaks candidly about the history of racism even within the feminist movement itself the organizers of the 1913 suffrage march on washington asked black women to march at the back of the parade the issue of race has followed the march from its inception the day after the election bob bland a fashion designer in new york floated the idea of a march in washington on facebook within hours 3 000 people said they would join then a friend called to tell ms bland that a woman in hawaii with a similar page had collected pledges from 12 000 people i thought wow let s merge ms bland recalled as the effort grew a number of comments on facebook implored ms bland who is white to include minority women on the leadership team ms bland felt strongly that it was the right thing to do within three days of the election carmen perez a hispanic activist working on juvenile justice and tamika d mallory a gun control activist who is black joined ms bland gloria steinem honorary of the march along with harry belafonte lauded their approach sexism is always made worse by racism and vice versa she said in an email ms steinem who plans to participate in a town hall meeting during the march with alicia garza a of black lives matter said even contentious conversations about race were a good thing it s about knowing each other she wrote which is what movements and marches are for but the tone of the discussion particularly online can become so raw that some marchers feel they are no longer welcome ms willis the south carolina wedding minister had been looking forward to the salve of rallying with people who share her values a rarity in her home state where she said she had been insulted and shouted at for marrying gay couples but then she read a post by shishi rose a blogger from brooklyn now is the time for you to be listening more talking less ms rose wrote you should be reading our books and understanding the roots of racism and white supremacy listening to our speeches you should be drowning yourselves in our poetry it rubbed ms willis the wrong way how do you know that i m not reading black poetry she asked in an interview ms willis says that she understands being born white gives her advantages and that she is always open to learning more about the struggles of others but she said the last thing that is going to make me endeared to you to know you and love you more is if you are sitting there wagging your finger at me ms rose said in an interview that the intention of the post was not to weed people out but rather to make them understand that they had a lot of learning to do i needed them to understand that they don t just get to join the march and not check their privilege constantly she said that phrase check your privilege exasperates ms willis she asked a reporter can you please tell me what that means ',\n",
       " 'after tom casperson a republican state senator from michigan s upper peninsula began running for congress in 2016 he assumed the family of betsy devos donald j trump s nominee to be education secretary would not oppose him the devoses a dominant force in michigan politics for decades with a fortune in the billions had contributed to one of mr casperson s earlier campaigns but a week before his primary family members sent 24 000 to one of his opponents then poured 125 000 into a super pac concerned taxpayers of america that ran ads attacking him the reason an intermediary told mr casperson his support from organized labor deceitful dishonest and cowardly was how mr casperson s campaign described the ads complaining that the groups running them won t say who they are or where their money is coming from on primary day mr casperson went down to defeat in announcing his intention to nominate ms devos mr trump described her as a brilliant and passionate education advocate even critics characterized her as a dedicated if misguided activist for school reform but that description understates both the breadth of ms devos s political interests and the influence she wields as part of her powerful family more than anyone else who has joined the incoming trump administration she represents the combination of wealth ideology and political hardball associated with a family of billionaires charles and david koch they have this moralized sense of the free market that leads to this total program to turn back the ideas of the new deal the welfare state kim a historian who has written extensively about the conservative movement said describing the devoses ms devos declined to be interviewed for this article like the kochs the devoses are generous supporters of think tanks that evangelize for unrestrained capitalism like michigan s acton institute and that rail against unions and back privatizing public services like the mackinac center they have also funded national groups dedicated to cutting back the role of government including the national center for policy analysis which has pushed for social security privatization and against environmental regulation and the institute for justice which challenges regulations in court and defends school vouchers both organizations have also received money from the koch family indeed the devoses education activism which favors alternatives to traditional public schools appears to derive from the same views that inform their suspicion of government and perhaps more than other billionaires the devoses couple their seeding of ideological causes with an aggressive brand of political spending half a dozen or more extended family members frequently coordinate contributions to maximize their impact in the 2016 cycle alone according to the michigan campaign finance network the family spent roughly 14 million on political contributions to state and national candidates parties pacs and super pacs all of this would make ms devos whose confirmation hearing has been delayed until next week amid mounting pressure that her government ethics review be completed beforehand very different from past education secretaries she is the most emblematic kind of oligarchic figure you can put in a cabinet position said jeffrey winters a political scientist at northwestern university who studies economic elites what she and the kochs have in common is the unbridled use of wealth power to achieve whatever political goals they have ms devos 59 grew up in holland mich the daughter of a conservative auto parts magnate who was an early funder of the family research council a conservative christian group when she married dick devos in 1979 it was akin to a merger between two royal houses of western michigan her husband s father richard sr of the multilevel marketing company amway was an active member of the christian reformed church that preached a mix of social conservatism and he once told the church s official magazine that chicago s poor dwelled in slums because that was the way they choose to live according to a washington post story from the 1980s a fan of and pinkie rings richard sr wrote books with titles like ten powerful phrases for positive people a similar air hung over his business amway sales representatives which the company calls independent business owners make money both by selling the company s products everything from perfume to toilet bowl cleaner and by recruiting other sales representatives the federal trade commission once investigated the company for running a pyramid scheme before concluding that it had misled potential recruits about how much they could expect to earn the flip side of the family s proselytizing for capitalism according to professor has been an effort to dismantle much that would counterbalance the power of economic elites amway funded a nationwide ad campaign in the early 1980s protesting high taxes and regulations not long after the company pleaded guilty to cheating the canadian government out of more than 20 million in revenue the family had a more winning public face in dick devos who combined the practiced empathy of a pitchman with the entitlement of an heir spending over 30 million on an unsuccessful run for governor of michigan in 2006 the detroit free press described him that year as the wealthiest man to seek office in the state s modern history betsy devos who served as chairwoman of the michigan republican party for most of the decade between 1996 and 2005 has often played the role of strategist in the relationship she was a key adviser in her husband s run for governor and publicly brooded that he had been too gentlemanly in his first debate against the incumbent he s very good with people a retail politician who looks you in the eye shakes your hand listens to what you say said randy richardville a former republican leader of the michigan senate describing the couple s strengths i would never underestimate betsy devos in a knife fight ms devos has sometimes lacked her husband s finesse once famously blaming many of the state s economic woes on high wages she has won detractors by their account by browbeating legislators into voting her way betsy devos was like my granddaughter at the time said mike pumford a former republican state representative who once clashed with her they were both sweet ladies as long as they kept hearing the word yes they turned into spoiled little brats when they were told no but ms devos has often made up for what she lacks in tact through sheer force of will mr richardville said he and ms devos disagreed over term limits which she supported as party chairwoman and he opposed i said i don t think you should be setting policy you should be supporting those of us who do make policy but she never backed down while dick and betsy devos appear to practice a more tolerant form of christianity than their parents ms devos has spoken out against bigotry as recently as the early 2000s they funded some groups like focus on the family a large ministry that helps set the political agenda for conservative evangelicals they have also backed groups that promote conservative values to students and christian education including one with ties to the christian reformed church their economic views are strikingly similar to the elder mr devos s according to federal disclosures amway which dick devos ran between 1993 and 2002 has lobbied frequently over the last 20 years to reduce or repeal the estate tax only the top 0 2 percent wealthiest estates paid the tax in 2015 the company has also opposed crackdowns on tax shelters ms devos has been an outspoken defender of unlimited contributions known as soft money which she described in a 1997 editorial as american dollars that big brother has yet to find a way to control after congress later passed a major campaign finance reform bill a nonprofit that ms devos helped to create and fund masterminded the strategy that produced citizens united the 2010 supreme court decision laying the groundwork for super pacs funded by corporations unions and individuals to raise and spend unlimited amounts in elections and then there are the family s efforts to rein in the labor movement through their contributions to think tanks like the mackinac center as well as mr devos s direct prodding of republican legislators the family played a key role in helping pass michigan s legislation in 2012 the legislation largely ended the requirement that workers pay fees to unions as a condition of employment unions in the state bled members in 2014 the first full year the measure was in effect allies say the devoses fight for their beliefs betsy and dick see themselves as principled conservatives said frederick hess of the american enterprise institute it kind of seems healthy and admirable to give resources to folks who are going to fight for causes you believe in but the fights can appear to be as much about consolidating power as ideology unions were arguably the family s most formidable political opponent in michigan one of labor s traditional strongholds the devos family s roots as education activists date back at least to when richard devos sr was running amway and an institute based at the company s headquarters trained teachers to inject principles into their curriculum according to an interview ms devos gave to philanthropy magazine she and her husband became interested in education causes when they began visiting a christian school that served children in grand rapids in the 1980s if we could choose the right school for our kids by which she appeared to mean primarily private schools it only seemed fair that they could do the same for theirs she told the magazine the family spent millions of dollars on a ballot proposal in 2000 asking if michigan should legalize vouchers in which students can use taxpayer money to attend private schools many critics like the education historian diane ravitch argue that the point of vouchers is to destroy public education and teachers unions the group americans united for separation of church and state has documented how conservative christians have long supported vouchers which could fund religious schools after voters objected by more than a ratio dick devos gave a speech at the heritage foundation saying such efforts would have to shift to state legislatures where groups backed by donors could offer a political consequence for opposition and political reward for support of education reform issues it is not unusual for the wealthy who devote nearly 50 percent of their philanthropic dollars to education according to the group to spend aggressively in the political realm to impose their preferred reforms even by these standards however the devoses stand out for the amount of money they spend trying to advance their goals through politics rather than philanthropy such as research into reforms or subsidizing schools as sarah reckhow an expert on education philanthropy at michigan state university put it the devoses are like no we know what we want we don t need to have all this window dressing ms devos has led two nonprofits that have spent millions of dollars electing governors and legislators sympathetic to school vouchers around the country matt frendewey a spokesman for one of the groups said the efforts had frequently been bipartisan and that the amount of money they had spent has been dwarfed by contributions from teachers unions opposed to reform yet in michigan at least the family s political strategy has not been subtle after he defied ms devos on a key charter school vote mr pumford the former republican legislator survived an effort by the great lakes education project a nonprofit the devoses bankrolled to defeat him in his 2002 primary but shortly after the house speaker told him the education committee chairmanship he coveted would not be forthcoming i said why mr pumford recalled he said you know why the devoses will walk away from us mr pumford added she told me that was going to happen rick johnson the house speaker said he did not recall the conversation but also that he had not promised mr pumford the chairmanship and would not have explained his reasons for withholding it over time the great lakes education project helped elect republican majorities sympathetic to the devoses agenda but the devoses lobbyists and operatives also discovered less messy ways to advance legislation late one night of their last workweek in 2015 the michigan house and senate were about to approve some uncontroversial changes to campaign finance law when the bill abruptly grew by more than 40 pages after the legislators discovered what they had voted for many said they were horrified tucked away in the new pages was a provision that would have made it much harder for local bodies like school boards to raise money through property tax increases michigan schools will likely suffer the brunt of the impact because the vast majority rely on periodic voter approval of local operating levy renewals for property taxes the ratings agency moody s wrote of the measure the following month i was fooled into voting for something i opposed said dave pagel a republican representative i consider it the worst vote i ve made the chief culprits according to mr pagel and others at the state capitol when the bill passed were lobbyists closely tied to the devoses tony daunt a spokesman for the michigan freedom fund a nonprofit headed by the devoses longtime political aide and whose political spending arm they have funded generously said the group was part of the discussion process with people in the legislature about the proposal and had consistently expressed support for the policy the law was later blocked by a federal judge but the group has vowed to try again ms devos s advocates see in these fights the toughness to take on entrenched opponents of expanding reforms like charter schools and vouchers in promoting ms devos in the washington post mitt romney the republican party s 2012 presidential nominee emphasized that her wealth gave her the independence to be someone who isn t financially biased shaping education he added devos doesn t need the job now nor will she be looking for an education job later but critics see someone with an unmistakable agenda the signs are there that she will do something radical said jack jennings a former general counsel for the house education committee trump wouldn t have appointed this woman for this position if he didn t intend something radical ',\n",

facing a defense heralded as one of the best ever with two minutes left trailing by 3 points watson got the ball at his own 32 and started a drive nine plays and 68 yards later with 1 second on the clock hunter renfrow caught a touchdown to win the game the drive included six completed passes notably a to watson s favorite target mike williams and a goal line pass interference call i m speechless right now man watson said after the game we worked so hard for it we fell short last year this game is not just for me it s for all the alumni the fans my family in gainesville it was the second big title game in a row for watson who threw for 405 yards in a loss in this game against alabama last season he is likely to go in the top 5 of the n f l draft this year watson s achilles heel during the regular season was the interception but he threw none in this game alabama for its part kept the ball mostly on the ground its freshman quarterback jalen hurts was for only 131 yards alabama had raced to a lead on two touchdowns by bo scarbrough watson cut the lead to with a long drive that ended with his touchdown run a game that started as a defensive struggle opened up in the second half more watson passing pulled clemson to within on a touchdown to renfrow hurts finally broke through with a touchdown to a o j howard making it alabama another long clemson drive concluded with a pass from watson to williams and clemson was back within 3 clemson seized its first lead in the game as wayne gallman punched in a touchdown run the key play in the drive was a pass to williams boosted by an unsportsmanlike conduct call against alabama alabama answered like champions with a quick drive hurts completed several passes including a to o j howard then he turned to his other strength running and barreled past defenders for a score but that only set up watson for his two minutes of heroics here s how clemson won the championship alabama was 25 percent of the way to another national championship leading clemson after one quarter in tampa the early stages of the game were mostly dominated by defense with the exception a lightning quick sequence of five plays that including a scramble by quarterback jalen hurts and a touchdown by bo scarbrough to put alabama in front alabama led by the freshman quarterback hurts mostly moved the ball on the ground hurts completed just 2 of 8 passes for 10 yards he looked especially ineffective going deep clemson had limited offensive success against the vaunted alabama defense quarterback deshaun watson was for 23 yards it never threatened to score the tigers were also hurt by an uninspired failed plunge on at the alabama 41 the clemson highlight was probably a partially blocked punt that took an alabama roll anyway turnovers were expected to be critical in the game and clemson had the only one of the quarter a bobbled snap by quarterback deshaun watson that gifted alabama the ball in clemson territory with 1 50 left in the period alabama held a lead at halftime of the college football playoff championship in tampa the game looked as good as won when favored alabama went up by in the second quarter alabama was breaking runs and its defense was swamping clemson s star quarterback deshaun watson alabama did it on the ground rushing for 143 yards the freshman quarterback jalen hurts was for only 40 yards watson woke up with a drive through the previously impenetrable alabama defense with six minutes left he capped it by taking the ball into the end zone himself he finished the half for 153 yards the game was dominated by the defenses which frustrated most of the game s drives on both sides watson avoided throwing an interception which he was often guilty of during the season clemson did lose one fumble a poor alabama punt gave clemson the ball at alabama s 42 and deshaun watson took advantage with a quick drive culminating in a touchdown to hunter renfrow watson was up to 228 yards passing that drive notwithstanding defense was generally trumping offense in the second half the best drive before the touchdown came from clemson as watson led the tigers from their own 16 to alabama s 43 the drive might have gone farther but a catch for a first down was overruled on review leaving clemson with a fourth and short watson stayed on the field and it seemed the tigers might go for it but it was a bluff and watson punted the ball jalen hurts of alabama had barely registered in the first three quarters of the national championship he was for only 49 yards and alabama after racing to a lead was up only then o j howard badly beat clemson s van smith and raced down the sidelines for a touchdown just like that hurts more than doubled his yardage for the game and alabama widened its lead to as the third quarter drew to a close it was a huge play for alabama which had been struggling on offense watson takes over a mostly defensive game opened up as the third quarter turned into the fourth with both teams scoring after alabama went up by on a pass play clemson answered with a drive consisting mostly of shortish passes from watson it finished with a pass from watson to his favorite target all year mike williams watson was up to 294 yards passing but alabama still led with 14 minutes left to play gallman gives clemson the lead clemson seized its first lead in the national championship as wayne gallman punched in a touchdown run the key play in the drive was a pass to williams boosted by an unsportsmanlike conduct call against alabama watson continued to solve the toughest defense in the country and increased his passing numbers to for 360 yards alabama retakes lead alabama behind for the first time in the game answered like champions with a quick drive

truck enveloping them in the country s familiar outpouring of love for its service members but this time the usually unifying ritual was marred by discord israelis called it the azaria effect referring to sgt elor azaria the soldier who was convicted last week of manslaughter for shooting a wounded and incapacitated palestinian assailant in the head video from the scene of sunday s attack showed dozens of armed soldiers fleeing from the truck instead of trying to shoot the driver some israelis who had complained that the army s high command failed to back up sergeant azaria asserted that the soldiers had fallen short because they were afraid of being put on trial the military security experts and soldiers at the scene quickly rejected that notion those who ran from the scene were not concerned about azaria but about their own said yehuda ben meir an expert in national security and public opinion at the institute for national security studies at tel aviv university still the argument unfolding in full volume on israeli news sites social media and broadcast channels reflected the disruptive influence the azaria affair has had on the army and its central place in israeli society in this small country where most jewish are drafted into years of service the military has long been a rare reserve of respect and consensus yet the same sentiment that leads israeli jews to treat soldiers as everybody s children has also led many to call for a pardon for sergeant azaria creating tension between the people and the commanders of their army the motherly protection of soldiers sometimes overcomes your basic value system mr ben meir said adding that the instinct to protect soldiers was not particular to israel the soldiers targeted by the palestinian truck driver on sunday were in officer training programs and most were not preparing for combat roles many were in the educational corps or training for administrative jobs on the home front on a routine educational tour of jerusalem they were caught as they disembarked from buses at a popular observation spot with panoramic views of old city the truck driver plowed into one group then reversed and came back to

driver it remained unclear on monday whether he had been killed by them or by civilians who opened fire the defense minister avigdor lieberman said that any attempt to link sunday s events to the azaria verdict had no basis one squad commander at the scene said she had instructed her forces to run for cover after determining that enough soldiers were already running toward the truck there were also concerns according to officers in the field that too many people shooting could cause a friendly fire accident the four soldiers who were killed all promoted posthumously were identified as lt

germany according to two law enforcement officials familiar with the case one of whom described the circumstances of the arrest the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the case mr schmidt formerly volkswagen s top emissions compliance executive in the united states has been charged with defrauding the government and violating the clean air act he made an initial appearance on monday in federal court in miami he will be moved to detroit where he was originally charged and where court documents suggest that he might be valuable in the government s investigation into other volkswagen officials mr schmidt 48 played a central role in volkswagen s of its diesel emissions cheating according to an affidavit from an f b i agent that was unsealed on monday even as the company obfuscated details of its cheating program from regulators mr schmidt warned executives in germany that the company could face criminal charges for its actions the affidavit says the case against mr schmidt sheds new doubt on volkswagen s assertions that top executives did not understand the full scale of the wrongdoing until early in september 2015 more than a year after questions were first raised about emissions from its vehicles mr schmidt briefed executives in detail months earlier in july according to the criminal complaint filed in federal court in michigan the timeline of the briefing has not been laid out before by prosecutors the complaint also says that other employees were involved in a suggesting that more charges could be coming it is unclear which employees above or below mr schmidt the government believes were involved mr schmidt reported to officials at volkswagen headquarters in wolfsburg volkswagen is nearing a deal with the justice department to pay more than 2 billion to resolve the criminal investigation into the emissions cheating according to three people briefed on the negotiations the company or one of its corporate entities is expected to plead guilty as part of the deal according to one of the people that deal though would not prevent charges against individual employees volkswagen s emissions scandal has cost the company 16 billion in civil settlements in the united states alone the fallout from the scandal has already reached volkswagen s executive ranks the automaker s chief executive martin winterkorn resigned in september several days after american regulators publicly accused the company of manipulating testing results german prosecutors are now investigating mr winterkorn and another executive hans dieter pötsch about whether they violated securities laws for united states investigators the arrest of mr schmidt is a stroke of luck their attempts to prosecute people suspected of being responsible for the scandal have been hampered because many of the people are in germany which does not normally extradite its citizens mr schmidt s lawyer david massey said in court that his client had learned of the investigation and contacted the f b i to cooperate he met with federal investigators in london in 2015 mr massey said reached by phone mr massey declined to comment further leaving unclear what came of the outreach to the government volkswagen declined to comment why mr schmidt risked arrest by traveling in the united states remains a mystery he is fluent in english and has extensive ties in the united states from his years working in the country for volkswagen a volkswagen employee since 1997 mr schmidt was named general manager of volkswagen s engineering and environmental office in auburn hills mich in 2013 in that job he was responsible for managing relations with the environmental protection agency and the powerful california air resources board the regulatory agencies that initially pursued the emissions cheating case mr schmidt was among the first to react in early 2014 when a study by west virginia university found evidence that volkswagen diesel cars polluted far more under normal driving conditions than they did in official testing labs in an email to a colleague in april 2014 he wrote it should first be decided whether we are honest according to an affidavit signed by ian dinsmore an f b i special agent the affidavit was the basis for a criminal complaint against mr schmidt volkswagen decided to mask its emissions cheating from regulators according to the complaint and lawsuits filed by the new york attorney general s office to buy time the company recalled volkswagens in the united states for an update of the engine software in early 2015 even though mr schmidt and others knew that change would not bring the cars into compliance according to the complaint in march mr schmidt was promoted to a new position in wolfsburg as he moved up he continued to play a crucial role in volkswagen s relations with regulators in july he briefed executives on the risks that volkswagen faced according to the complaint mr schmidt and other volkswagen employees briefed top managers in wolfsburg ahead of a meeting with officials at the california regulatory agency also known as carb which took the lead in the investigation mr schmidt explained that the cars contained software that recognized when a vehicle was undergoing tests the defeat device increased pollution controls so the cars would pass muster mr

       " 'here s a look at the most memorable moments from the 2017 golden globes including meryl streep s acceptance speech jimmy fallon s lackluster hosting funny presenters and awkward flubs meryl streep campaigned on behalf of hillary clinton so expectations were high that when she took the golden globes stage to accept the cecil b demille lifetime achievement award she would comment on the recent election but how political would she be pretty political as it turned out she used her speech to call out donald j trump for seeming to mock a disabled new york times reporter and to warn that a free press would need to be defended this instinct to humiliate when it s modeled by someone in the public platform by someone powerful it filters down into everybody s life because it kinda gives permission for other people to do the same thing she said disrespect invites disrespect violence incites violence and when the powerful use their position to bully others we all lose the room roundly applauded her remarks but on social media some conservative commentators immediately criticized her and the target of her remarks had his own take in an interview with the times mr trump dismissed ms

       " 'how america lost its secretsedward snowden the man and the theftby edward jay epsteinillustrated 350 pp alfred a knopf 27 95 people who reveal secrets are either heroes or betrayers depending on what the secrets are and on the inclinations of the audience for them in the case of edward snowden who took and then released a great deal of internal data from the national security agency in 2013 his admirers have campaigned for a pardon by president obama but donald trump has mused that execution might be more appropriate journalism based on snowden s revelations won the pulitzer prize for public service in 2014 and the oscar for best documentary in 2015 on the other hand many american government officials think snowden who lives in russia should be brought home and prosecuted for revealing classified information in 2014 edward jay epstein the veteran writer on espionage published a provocative article in the wall street journal proposing another way of looking at snowden as a spy epstein wrote that an unnamed former member of president obama s cabinet had told him that there are only three possible explanations for the snowden heist 1 it was a russian espionage operation 2 it was a chinese espionage operation 3 it was a joint operation now epstein has produced a long detailed book elaborating on his theory snowden is known for having revealed that the n s a was illegally spying on american citizens but epstein says that he actually took almost a million documents that had nothing to do with that which he didn t give to journalists what happened to them how did a relatively lowly nonemployee at the agency without much official access manage to get all that material in the first place why did he choose to announce himself to the world from hong kong and why has he remained in moscow since he left hong kong you can see the outlines of a coherent hypothesis in how america lost its secrets perhaps snowden was planted at the n s a by either russia or china or by both perhaps while he was there he worked with other as yet undetected insiders who were also serving foreign powers perhaps in hong kong he put himself into the care of chinese handlers who debriefed him extensively during the nearly two weeks between his arrival and his perhaps the same thing happened in moscow during the first 37 days after he landed there when he seems to have been hiding somewhere inside the airport security perimeter perhaps his reward for in effect defecting has been the odd protected life in russia that celebrated spies like kim philby and guy burgess previously enjoyed perhaps his role as a was merely a counterintuitive because it was so public new form of cover epstein proves none of this how america lost its secrets is an impressively fluffy and wobbly soufflé of speculation full of anonymous sourcing and suppositional language like it seems plausible to believe or it doesn t take a great stretch of the imagination to conclude epstein s first book inquest published more than 50 years ago featured another mysterious young man who spent time in moscow lee harvey oswald this book has a feeling because it touches on several of epstein s preoccupations russia the movie and media businesses the gullibility of liberals and especially the world of penetration exfiltration false flags and other aspects of counterintelligence the spirit of james jesus angleton the c i a s counterintelligence chief during the peak years of the cold war and evidently a mentor to epstein he s mentioned several times hovers over these pages sometimes it seems as if epstein so much enjoys exploring the twists and turns in snowden s story his encounter with snowden s mysterious lawyer in moscow anatoly kucherena is especially memorable that he doesn t have an overwhelming need to settle the questions he raises the sentence from the wall street journal quoted above appears almost verbatim in the book but it s immediately followed by this these severe accusations generated much heat but little light they were not accompanied by any evidence showing that snowden had acted in concert with any foreign power in stealing the files or for that matter that he was not acting out of his own personal convictions no matter how misguided they might have been but then epstein spends many more pages considering and not dismissing the very same severe accusations and ends by saying that snowden s theft of state secrets u2008 u2008 had evolved deliberately or not but necessarily into a mission of disclosing key national secrets to a foreign power this is epstein s primary conclusion even if the american public was a partial beneficiary of snowden s revelations the main beneficiary was russia which to his mind couldn t possibly have failed to take possession of all the material snowden took from the n s a whatever caveats he uses and whatever hard evidence he hasn t found epstein clearly wants to leave readers with the impression that snowden remains in russia as a result of a deal exchanging his information for its protection he repeatedly hints that he has reason to be more certain about his conclusion than he s able to say in print snowden julian assange of wikileaks and their immediate circle of allies come from a radically libertarian hacker culture that most of the time doesn t believe there should be an n s a at all whether or not it remains within the confines of its legal charter epstein conversely is a strong supporter of the agency s official mission of communication intercepts which he sees as an essential element in the united states ability to participate in the game of nations to him one of the lessons of the snowden case is that the agency s reliance on private contractors like snowden instead of career employees has made it dangerously vulnerable to security breaches it s an irony of the years since the reagan revolution that one political strain in the united states suspicion of big government has led to spending and staffing limits that have pushed the n s a into the private marketplace to perform its mission the contractor that employed snowden had been acquired by a private equity firm that was pressuring it to cut costs and elaborate background checks are expensive that conflicts with another strain of modern conservatism support for a vast apparatus whatever his motive snowden found a way to arbitrage that contradiction the age of the internet vladimir putin snowden and wikileaks has generated its own particular form of disruption around how we think about the revelation of government secrets traditional spies seem far less important these days because unclubbable technically adept people can do that kind of work far more effectively the press at least for now has assumed a larger role in the ecosystem of revelation because hackers prefer finding partners in the mainstream media to simply releasing information on their own but this new set of arrangements makes journalists look more like conduits and contextualizers and less like originators of information reporters aren t supposed to be hackers themselves see the news of the world scandals in london five years ago but they re not capable of resisting juicy information that others have hacked no matter how unsavory the purpose see the ubiquitous coverage of john podesta s private emails during the fall campaign journalists are quite comfortable with the idea of the news media uncovering government secrets that should not have been secret in the first place this may be a role whose run is coming to an end information is too copious and flows too freely and there are too many players in the revelation game political activists foreign governments tricksters for journalists to function as the arbiters of revelation if there isn t any longer going to be one trustworthy group in society the established press that acts as a benign check on excessive government secrecy the discussion of what should and shouldn t be secret becomes a lot messier epstein has long been annoyed with the idea of the press as the key actor in secrecy dramas digging up what the public should know but not exposing everything way back in 1974 he published an article in commentary called did the press uncover watergate his answer no this time around his concern seems to be half

ban on muslim immigration and other ideas that had been floated by mr trump mr sessions a deeply conservative republican from alabama who was an early trump supporter appears headed for confirmation after completing more than nine hours of testimony before the senate judiciary committee mr sessions and his allies had girded for a coordinated attack on his civil rights record but democrats tempered their criticism and republicans mounted a defense describing him repeatedly as a man of integrity in his two decades on capitol hill mr sessions has questioned whether the constitution guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the united states has said courts have interpreted the separation of church and state too broadly and has declared marriage a threat to american culture he also voted against reauthorizing the violence against women act much of the hearing focused on mr sessions s long record as a prosecutor and a senator but mr trump proved a dominant figure in absentia for much of the debate as democrats sought to question the by proxy they asked whether mr sessions supported mr trump s most controversial statements and questioned whether he had the independence to rein in the mr trump if he seeks to exceed his presidential authority in his cool southern drawl mr sessions vowed repeatedly that he would saying that an attorney general cannot be a mere rubber stamp for the president if an attorney general is asked to do something that s plainly unlawful he said that person would have to resign ultimately before agreeing to execute a policy that the attorney general believes would be unlawful or unconstitutional but he indicated that he did not believe he would reach that impasse if he advises mr trump that a policy is illegal he said i am confident that he would heed that advice a methodist he also pledged to set aside his personal beliefs and aggressively enforce all federal laws even in areas like abortion gay rights and hate crimes where he has made his opposition well known i don t think it would be hard for me to be impartial and enforce laws that i didn t vote for he said i think i can separate my personal votes of maybe years ago from what my responsibilities is today he was asked for instance about a law he opposed in the senate making attacks based on sexual orientation a hate crime the law has been passed the congress has spoken and you can be sure i will enforce it mr sessions said many of mr sessions s answers appeared calculated to distance himself from some of mr trump s most contentious threats and pledges on the campaign trail he said for instance that current law absolutely bans waterboarding and the use of other torture techniques against prisoners even though mr trump promised to reinstitute the practice and mr sessions himself supported it for years asked about last week s report by intelligence agencies that russia tried to influence the american election he said that i have no reason to doubt that and no information that would indicate otherwise a sharp contrast from mr trump s weeks of skepticism mr trump last week called the uproar over russia s role a political witch hunt he said he also opposed creating a registry of american muslims or banning muslim immigrants as mr trump proposed repeatedly during the campaign in response to terrorist attacks i have no belief and do not support the idea that muslims as a religious group should be denied admission to the united states mr sessions said but he said he supported using extreme vetting of immigrants that might take into account religious beliefs an idea mr trump now appears to have endorsed mr sessions also appeared to play down the prospects that his justice department would seek to jail hillary clinton over her private email server another pledge that mr trump made repeatedly during the campaign mr sessions surprised lawmakers by declaring that he would recuse himself from any decisions on mrs clinton s emails or the clinton foundation because he said that critical statements he made about her during the campaign might pose a conflict mr sessions had previously supported appointing a special prosecutor to investigate mrs clinton the f b i s investigation into her private email server is closed and while a preliminary investigation into the clinton foundation is open senior law enforcement officials say there is little basis for the case to move forward he deflected questions about mr trump with a calm stoicism but he grew angry and emotional when democrats pressed him on a more personal matter accusations of racial insensitivity toward his employees and others as a federal prosecutor which doomed his nomination for a federal judgeship in 1986 protesters in the ornate senate hearing room who disrupted the proceedings more than a dozen times during the day erupted in chants of sessions is a racist and no trump no k k k no fascist u s a two men dressed as klansmen in white

sessions sought to distance himself on tuesday from some of mr trump s controversial stances he embraced the s focus on toughened immigration laws and a law and order agenda priorities he himself has stressed for years he promised to escalate federal arrests and prosecutions of undocumented immigrants drug dealers gun traffickers and violent criminals in response to a rise in crime in some cities and he declared that protecting the american people from the scourge of radical islamic terrorism will continue to be a top priority critical to that agenda he said will be improving federal relations with the police after the intense scrutiny that has followed a string of police shootings of black men often unarmed law enforcement as a whole has been unfairly maligned and blamed for the unacceptable actions of a few of their bad actors mr sessions said they believe the political leadership in the country has abandoned them indeed mr sessions questioned the obama administration s use of civil rights lawsuits and consent decrees to force changes in training and policies at police departments that have been accused of unconstitutional tactics although mr sessions has completed his testimony the hearings will continue on wednesday with testimony by advocates on both sides witnesses supporting mr sessions will include former attorney general michael b mukasey and larry thompson a

lingering investigations involving hillary clinton s emails or her family s foundation retired gen john f kelly the homeland security nominee said that a wall on the border with mexico would not by itself remedy illegal immigration here s the latest senator richard blumenthal democrat of connecticut questioned mr sessions about his links to groups and people who have taken xenophobic views here s a quick primer from a recent times profile mr blumenthal asked how can americans have confidence that you re going to enforce laws if you ve accepted awards from these kinds of groups and associated with these kinds of individuals and won t return the awards mr sessions said he does not necessarily share the views of every political donor or organization he has received an award from mr sessions came of age in the justice department at the height of the crack epidemic he has described himself as a lieutenant in the war on drugs said he was heartbroken when president obama compared marijuana to alcohol and criticized the administration for not enforcing drug laws in states like colorado that have legalized marijuana he said in 2015 flash forward to tuesday mr sessions sidestepped questions about whether he would put the weight of the justice department behind drug prosecution in those states doing so would set up a huge fight over states rights and federal drug policy i know it won t be an easy decision he said senate democrats do not have the votes by themselves to prevent mr sessions from becoming attorney general and they have spared their colleague any vitriol doing little to undermine his confirmation mr sessions was prepared to face renewed questions about race and comments he was accused of making in the 1980s regarding the n a a c p the american civil liberties union and views liberal activists have repeatedly disrupted the hearing screaming k k k or racist but the questioning from democrats has mostly focused on his senate record and whether he would enforce laws that he disagreed with he has said he would in short there is no indication so far that his confirmation is in jeopardy mr sessions who has supported the use of waterboarding as an interrogation tactic said that current law makes it absolutely improper and illegal that s important because it suggests that mr sessions sees no workaround that would allow mr trump to reinstate such tactics mr sessions has previously said he supported the justice department legal analysis that authorized harsh interrogation in c i a prisons and has said that waterboarding works by saying that the law against waterboarding is clear mr sessions makes it much harder if not impossible for mr trump to bring it back in response to a question about whether he supported a temporary ban on muslim immigration as mr trump has suggested mr sessions said he did not i have no belief and do not support the idea that muslims as a religious groups should be denied admission to the united states he said but he noted that mr trump has since clarified that the restriction should be on immigration from countries that support terrorism he said religious views where for example they include justification for violence against americans should be considered as part of the visa progress would you support a law that says you can t come to america because you re a muslim asked senator lindsey graham republican of south carolina no mr sessions replied mr sessions was a top surrogate for mr trump during a campaign in which lock her up was a rallying cry against mrs clinton mr sessions said that if there were lingering investigations into mrs clinton s use of a private email server or her family foundation he would recuse himself you intend to recuse yourself from both the clinton email matter and any investigation involving the clinton foundation if there are any asked senator charles e grassley republican of iowa yes mr sessions said this country doesn t punish its political enemies mr sessions last faced the judiciary committee three decades ago for a seat on the federal bench his nomination failed in part over allegations that he had described civil rights groups as and that he had suggested a white lawyer was a disgrace to his race for representing at the time he said his comments were misunderstood or taken out of context he offered a more forceful denial this time i never declared that the n a a c p was or that a civil rights attorney was a disgrace to his race mr sessions said in 1986 he described it this way and here s how he described the disgrace to his race exchange mr sessions assured his senate colleagues that he would strictly adhere to the constitution and stand up to the president if needed he s been consistent for years that senators should apply that test to justice department nominees the republican theme of the hearing is that mr sessions is a known entity and he reinforced that in his opening remarks you know who i am he said you know what i believe in mr sessions has been in the senate for nearly 20 years and is liked by his colleagues moderate republicans and at least one democrat have said they will vote for him which all but guarantees his confirmation and general kelly is likely to be easily confirmed that does not mean democrats will hold their fire but they are likely to mount their most vigorous offensive against other nominees including representative tom price a georgia republican who is mr trump s choice to be health secretary while mr sessions faced some tough questioning the early going for general kelly was more gentle mr gates a former defense secretary under mr obama and george w bush introduced general kelly as a candid courageous leader who will say exactly what he thinks but what sets him apart mr gates said is his character to put it quite simply he is one of the finest people i have ever known he said i would trust him with my life senator claire mccaskill of missouri the committee s top democrat asked mr kelly to be ready to take tough questions but thanked him for providing the disclosures necessary by the office of government ethics whose review was completed this week she asked mr kelly to hew closely to what he had described as his greatest strength speaking truth to power that was music to my ears ms mccaskill said i believe very much in that principle and i think we all anticipate that you will need it in your next job given your experience i expect you to be up to that challenge she added and i think if you re backing down you ll probably hear from me in response to questions from senator john mccain republican of arizona about mr trump s proposal to build a wall on the southern border general kelly said a physical barrier wasn t going to stem the problem if you were to build a wall from the pacific to mexico you would still have to have it backed up by people by sensors by other technologies he said the kelly hearing was remarkable for its subdued tone with republicans and democrats alike cordially asking mr kelly about mr trump s more contentious stances like forcing muslims to register with the federal government one by one he put their concerns to rest in a measured tone it apparently proved too subdued for the protest group code pink a couple of activists listened in their bright pink capes mere hours after disrupting the confirmation hearing

central intelligence agency have all been pushed back as democrats clamor for more time to collect and review the standard background checks that nominees traditionally undergo before their hearings commence wilbur ross mr trump s pick for secretary of commerce will also be delayed several days because his ethics agreement is not complete according to the chairman and ranking democrat of the commerce committee the delays represent a stumble for the incoming trump administration which has vowed to run government with a businesslike efficiency and highlights how in several respects its preparation to take office is behind that of predecessors in the case of ms devos a billionaire a complex web of financial holdings may be slowing down the office of government ethics which helps federal officials address conflict of interest matters while mr puzder s background documents are also not in order walter m shaub jr the director of the ethics office said in a letter to senator patty murray democrat of washington that he did not know when ms devos would be cleared by his agency as this was dependent on the nominee to provide needed information respond to questions and accept

been pressuring the ethics office to expedite its processes even though it did not get the necessary paperwork from most of his nominees until recently putting republicans in a difficult position of either pushing forward with hearings without proper vetting something most of the chairmen are loath to do or delaying them in some cases indefinitely trump is the latest to begin the process in contemporary history said paul c light a professor of public service at new york university who worked on capitol hill as an adviser on transitions this puts the republicans under pressure and sets up possible problems down the road mr trump is asking the senate to make up for his own failures here the conservative organization america rising pac took aim at mr shaub on monday highlighting his history as a democrat and the double standard he employed as head of the agency highlighting his political donations to president obama as well as his office s utter incompetence in policing financial matters related to hillary and bill clinton the pac chided mr shaub for wading into the politics of the transitions saying his public comments and criticisms had become fodder for congressional democrats to try and score points the pac noted an informal and series of postings on twitter from the office s official account congratulating mr trump on divesting from his real estate business a move he had not made the head of president obama s ethics department has absolutely zero credibility to criticize others scott sloofman a spokesman for america rising pac said in an email adding that

administration of george w bush working as a supervisory lawyer in 2008 he became a deputy general counsel and then president obama in 2013 nominated mr shaub as director of the office ethics experts

recently retired marine corps general can serve as secretary of defense in the trump administration the hearing on the importance of civilian control of the military which was led by senator john mccain of arizona is intended to set the stage for the committee s confirmation hearing on mr mattis s nomination on thursday military officers are barred by law from serving as defense secretary unless they have been out of office for seven years mr mattis retired from the military in may 2013 but in an encouraging sign for his prospects the lawmakers appeared to be generally receptive to the experts arguments the principle of civilian control of the military is precious said eliot a cohen a professor at the johns hopkins school of advanced international studies who served as state department counselor during the george w bush administration but mr cohen who was a never trumper during the campaign argued that an exception should be made because mr mattis was a person of integrity and had vital experience at a time when the pentagon has to contend with multiple threats and because he might dissuade the incoming administration from acting recklessly a secretary mattis would be a stabilizing and moderating force preventing wildly stupid dangerous and illegal things from happening and over time helping to steer american foreign and security policy in a sound and sensible direction mr cohen said kathleen h hicks an expert at the center for strategic and international studies also said that it was appropriate to make an exception for mr mattis and praised his character and expertise it should never be considered time for a general to fill the nonelected civilian position in the operational chain she said referring to mr trump s comments in a november interview i assess the state of u s relations to be strong enough to withstand any risk such a exception on its own could pose she added trump s transition team is considering asking the deputy defense secretary robert work to remain in his position at the pentagon for several months after mr trump s inauguration according to an official familiar with the discussions while no final decision has been made the official suggested that mr work could provide some initial bureaucratic stability as mr mattis builds his team at the pentagon last month mr trump announced his intention to nominate

claim that they re inventing technology to change the world and their philanthropic efforts often mirror those big global goals and dreams with initiatives to end hunger and fight diseases but the arts in san francisco haven t always felt their generosity even as total philanthropic spending in the bay area has more than doubled over the past decade to around 5 billion according to the foundation center it s been difficult for some arts groups to find support with so many organizations competing for attention and funding last year for example with social inequality such a issue one heavyweight charitable organization the james irvine foundation chose to stop spending on the arts and switch all of its future giving toward addressing poverty the move has important repercussions in 2015 the irvine foundation gave 15 45 million to the arts more than a fifth of the foundation s total grants so on tuesday culture fans were given a reason to cheer when the william and flora hewlett foundation announced a plan to spend 8 million on performing arts projects in the bay area over the next five years a panel of experts convened by the foundation will help select 50 works from artists in the bay area the performances will include dance theater music and performance art there s much more of a demand for arts than we can hope to fulfill said larry kramer the president of the foundation which gets its funding from the fortune made from one of the founders of the pioneering computer company it s hard to raise money for the arts said ben mangan the executive director of the center for social sector leadership at the university of california berkeley s haas school of business the arts don t fall neatly into a category of a problem to solve giving money away is fraught

       " 'update a federal jury has unanimously sentenced dylann s roof to die the white supremacist showed no remorse for killing nine members of a black church in south carolina read more mr roof a white supremacist with no known ties to any organized group was convicted of the assault on dec 15 by the same federal jury mr roof s guilt was never in question in the trial and the jury deliberated for about three hours before assessing the death penalty judge richard m gergel has scheduled a formal sentencing hearing for wednesday at 9 30 a m we want to express our sympathy to all of the families who were so grievously hurt by dylann roof s actions today s sentencing decision means that this case will not be over for a very long time we are sorry that despite our best efforts the legal proceedings have shed so little light on the reasons for this tragedy we are dylann roof s family we will always love dylann we will struggle as long as we live to understand why he committed this horrible attack which caused so much pain to so many good people we wish to express the grief we feel for the victims of his crimes and our sympathy to the many families he has hurt we continue to pray for the emanuel a m e families and the charleston community no verdict can bring back the nine we lost that day at mother emanuel and no verdict can heal the wounds of the five church members who survived the attack or the souls of those who lost loved ones to roof s callous hand but we hope that the completion of the prosecution provides the people of charleston and the people of our nation with a measure of closure on the evening of wednesday june 17 2015 mr roof a white man walked into the emanuel african methodist episcopal church in charleston s c and asked for the pastor the rev clementa c pinckney mr roof was directed to a bible study session where he sat down next to the pastor and for nearly an hour listened and took part in the discussion mr roof then pulled out a glock semiautomatic pistol loaded with bullets and according to witnesses told the minister and parishioners you are raping our women and taking over our country he shot and killed nine people including mr pinckney before fleeing the church he shot each victim multiple times reloading his gun several times mr roof told investigators and friends that he had hoped to start a race war he complained of what he saw as black corruption and takeover of the united states and what he said was an epidemic of crime he owned a website that included an essay on his belief in the danger and inferiority of blacks and the value of segregation in the essay mr roof a dropout with few friends and no steady work also gave his reasons for the attack we have no skinheads no real kkk no one doing anything but talking on the internet well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world and i guess that has to be me the gunman could not have chosen a target more laden with symbolism about the nation s tortured racial history and he apparently knew it singling out the church for that reason emanuel a m e lies in the historic heart of charleston the capital of the slave trade in the united states the cradle of the confederacy and the place where the first shots of the civil war were fired the church known as mother emanuel occupies a place of pride in southern black history it is one of the oldest black congregations in the south dating back two centuries many people were shaken because the shooting happened in a place of sanctuary and because of who the victims were nine people who were described as gentle and deeply religious three of them were over age 70 and four were pastors at mr roof s first court appearance a few days later victims family members stunned and moved millions of americans by speaking of forgiveness and redemption rather than anger and vengeance black churches have been frequent targets of racist attacks for generations and for people old enough to remember the shooting carried reminders of the 1963 church bombing in birmingham ala that killed four black girls one of the charleston dead mr pinckney 41 was also a democratic state senator and a leader of south carolina s black community whose warmth won him friends even among political adversaries at his funeral president obama gave the eulogy an impassioned plea to recognize and oppose prejudice saying for too long we ve been blind to the way past injustices continue to shape the present after decades of debate a confederate battle flag was removed from the grounds of south carolina s state capitol with remarkable swiftness lowered for good less than a month after the shooting following an emotional debate in the legislature in previous fights over the flag white conservatives defended it staunchly but this time conservative republicans like gov nikki haley senator lindsey graham and state senator paul thurmond son of the united states senator and onetime segregationist champion strom thurmond publicly opposed the flag sealing its fate but calls for stricter gun controls including tighter background checks for buying weapons fell flat under federal law mr roof s record of drug abuse might have barred him from buying the gun he used but the balky background check system failed to produce the needed information within three days so he was able to go ahead with the purchase mr roof confessed to investigators soon after he was arrested and more recently he offered to plead guilty in return for a sentence of life in prison but federal prosecutors decided to go to trial and seek the death penalty at his trial last month his lawyers conceded that he had committed the attack a jury found him guilty of all 33 counts against him including hate crimes resulting in death the case then moved to the penalty phase to determine whether mr roof should be executed if he had not been sentenced to die he could have still faced capital punishment in state court acting as his own lawyer in the penalty phase mr roof declined to present any defense and he refused any argument or evidence suggesting mental illness in a journal he kept before the shooting he had written i am morally opposed to psychology it is a jewish invention the vast majority of capital sentences and executions stem from state courts not federal of about 2 900 people on death rows in the united states just 68 face sentences meted out by federal courts including six by military courts the federal inmates under death sentences include dzhokhar tsarnaev one of the brothers who carried out the boston marathon bombing in 2013 and nidal hasan who committed the fort hood shooting in 2009 when timothy mcveigh the oklahoma city bomber was executed in 2001 he was the first federal inmate put to death in 38 years there have been just two federal executions since then in 2001 and 2003 it would be hard to find another crime where the toll was as high the victims were as sympathetic the premeditation was as evident and the defendant s guilt was as but mr roof s case has prompted a debate over whether he should be put to death some commentators and editorial boards have argued that a crime of this magnitude cries out for execution even some with doubts about how the death penalty is used say that if capital punishment is to continue mr roof warrants it death penalty opponents agree that if any defendant deserves the ultimate punishment it is mr roof but they insist that the case against capital punishment should still outweigh the anger and revulsion over any particular case they argue that its use has been wildly inconsistent and even arbitrary and exonerations of convicted inmates show that the risk of putting an innocent person to death is high a twist in this case is that a common argument against the death penalty is that it is more likely to be used when the victims are white and the accused are black the reverse of the circumstances in the charleston shooting another is that even some family members of those who were murdered have spoken out against executing mr roof much less common than it used to be states carried out 20 executions last year the lowest figure in 25 years courts handed down just 30 new death sentences down from more than 300 in 1996 the lowest figure since the early 1970s ',\n",

lawyer said there is absolutely no basis for any claim of sexual harassment against bill o reilly by juliet huddy jeanne m christensen a lawyer for ms huddy at wigdor l l p declined to comment ms huddy made her allegations known to fox news in the letter her lawyers sent to the network in august the settlement was reached on sept 5 at a time when the company was completing other agreements including one with gretchen carlson the former anchor whose sexual harassment suit forced the departure of mr ailes mr ailes has denied allegations of sexual harassment the company has not reached an

against the company in august mr o reilly has a towering presence at fox news he was close to mr ailes and his show generated about 180 million in advertising in 2015 according to kantar media an firm he was also viewed by employees and program hosts as an influential figure in the newsroom he was the gatekeeper to time on his show and his support could be crucial to advancement but mr o reilly had run into problems before in 2004 a producer on his show andrea mackris sued him asserting that he had made unwanted sexual advances and lewd comments in a series of phone calls and dinner conversations according to the suit mr o reilly told her on multiple occasions to buy a vibrator called her when it sounded as if he was masturbating and described various sexual fantasies after two weeks of sensational headlines in new york s tabloid newspapers mr o reilly settled for millions of dollars according to people briefed on the agreement both sides said that no wrongdoing had occurred

jerusalem in january 2011 mr o reilly invited ms huddy to lunch near his home in manhasset on long island according to the letter after lunch he drove her back to his home where he showed her every room including his bedroom and his collection of presidential memorabilia to shock and disgust as ms huddy was saying goodbye to mr o reilly he quickly moved in and kissed her on the lips the letter said ms huddy was so taken aback and repulsed that she instinctively recoiled and actually fell to the ground mr o reilly looking amused did not even help ms huddy up the next week mr o reilly asked her to join him for dinner at the harvard club followed by a broadway show according to the letter and to current and former fox news employees ms huddy was not interested in having a romantic relationship with mr o reilly but the letter said she felt compelled to comply with mr o reilly s request given that he had total control over her work assignment during the broadway show according to the letter mr o reilly moved close to ms huddy in a way that made her feel uncomfortable he tried to hold her hand but she pulled it away then he dropped a key to the room at a midtown manhattan hotel he was staying at into her lap and told her to meet him there after the show he stood up and left the letter said ms huddy went to the hotel to return mr o reilly s key according to the letter she asked him to meet her in the lobby but he refused and asked her to join him in his room ms huddy declined and explained that she was not interested in mr o reilly on a personal or sexual level the

he was wearing only boxer shorts according to the letter ms huddy was very embarrassed handed mr o reilly his key and quickly left the letter said in the months after mr o reilly and ms huddy went to the show in manhattan his obsession with her only escalated the letter said mr o reilly started calling ms huddy at all hours even while he was on vacation at times the calls were about work but they were sometimes highly inappropriate and sexual the letter said on some occasions it sounded as if mr o reilly was masturbating the letter said disgusted ms huddy came up with an excuse and hung up the phone the letter said as mr o reilly s pursuit continued ms huddy answered and returned fewer of his calls ms huddy s rejection of mr o reilly apparently did not sit well with him as he began to retaliate against her both on and off air the letter said mr o reilly nitpicked her work and would berate ms huddy for minor mistakes according to the letter mr o reilly stopped preparing her for segments and would surprise her with story angles that they had not discussed in 2013 ms huddy was replaced on one segment of his show another segment that she was featured in called mad as hell was canceled she did not complain fearing retaliation she told current and former fox news employees at the time the letter also included a series of accusations by ms huddy against mr abernethy including that he started trashing her after she rejected his attempts to pursue a personal relationship mr abernethy signed a new multiyear contract with fox news in september after having been named a president of the network in august at the time the company was aware of the allegations against mr abernethy which it has said are false as part of ms huddy s confidential agreement with 21st century fox she agreed not to disparage malign or defame the parties the company on its behalf and on the behalf of mr o reilly and mr abernethy agreed not to disparage malign or defame ms huddy the consequences for breaking confidentiality are severe costing either side 500 000 per infringement according to the document ms huddy is also liable if her lawyers or a person close to her discloses the terms of the agreement on sept 7 ms huddy who had hosted good day early call on wnyw a fox affiliate went on the station and gave a tearful goodbye thank you to everyone who has made the last 20 years the most challenging but best of my life she said perhaps someday even someday soon you ll see me on television again ',\n",
       " 'i m on the verge of giving up trying to explain why ignacio mattos s food is so good i once wrote that the cooking at his first restaurant now closed dabbled in deep surrealist weirdness at estela the place on houston street that put him on the map i described his food as almost familiar but not quite what struck me at his most recent restaurant café altro paradiso was the inverse relationship between prettiness and deliciousness what i ate was unpretty and highly delicious in retrospect nothing i wrote captured the qualities that made the food compelling i latched on to visual style because i couldn t figure out how to explain why the flavors grabbed me the way they did after spending some time at flora bar which mr mattos opened in october i ve started to think that whatever it is that sets his food apart is something you can t see it s a kind of cooking that s almost invisible flora bar is inside the met breuer museum marcel breuer s blunt and muscular stack of granite and concrete on madison avenue in the 70s regarded as a masterpiece of the brutalist style the taste for its disconcertingly inverted pyramidal mass grows on one slowly the architecture critic for the new york times ada louise huxtable wrote in 1966 like a taste for olives or warm beer the food at flora bar is much easier to like than warm beer under the direction of jake nemmers the executive chef it comes out of the kitchen in a series of tidily formal circles and squares the rough edges of the cooking at altro paradiso and estela have been refined which makes it even more astonishing when the flavors come at you out of nowhere a simple red disc on a white plate flora bar s tuna tartare isn t like any i ve had before it pops with toasted flax seeds and crunches with fried shallots neither of which hides the clean cold taste of chopped yellowfin tuna flora bar does not quite reinvent tuna tartare the way estela reinvents beef tartare but it comes closer than you d think was possible steak comes with béarnaise and beet hunks the beets look a little wrinkled like prunes and have an uncannily focused flavor the béarnaise is silky and light on the herbs the steak looks like steak sliced it is tender and the flavor goes on and on as you chew yet it doesn t have the stink of beef something must have happened to make it so extraordinary but the answer is not visible the beef has been given among other treatments a surreptitious marination in fish sauce how can a shrimp cocktail hold any surprises well there s the price 29 which may be a record but then there s the astonishingly fine flavor and texture of the blue shrimp themselves glossy and appealingly slippery on a bed of ice pebbles they re terrific and so is their dark uncloying cocktail sauce note the name flora bar is when you get down to it less a restaurant than a wine bar the plates are almost all small even the steak which could pass as a main course is a far cry from a steakhouse portion flora bar is not trying to be a utilitarian cafe for museum patrons who knocked themselves out taking in kerry james marshall s show upstairs and now want a cheap filling meal that job goes to flora coffee next door where you can get sandwiches and pastries during the day the wine list at flora bar is about as exhaustive as any artist s career retrospective it contains multitudes and in three visits i barely scratched the surface and i left the shelves and shelves of tempting knowledgeably chosen spirits mostly untouched apart from the slug of gin that went into my very soothing tuxedo no 2 cocktail as wine bars go it s somewhat stiff the service can be punctilious in a way that i imagine is meant to appeal to the upper east sider but fans of estela and there are many upper east siders in that group may find it slightly or mr mattos and his business partner thomas carter may just be trying to live up to the space it s an exceptionally dramatic one with marble surfaces and banquettes of dark leather and windows the size of billboards that look out on breuer s bridge across the moat below madison avenue a sculpture garden when this building still housed the whitney museum of american art the moat is now an outdoor extension for flora bar i miss the art but the tables look inviting enough to make me come back when the weather warms up the menu is part tapas part sashimi and part something else on the tapas side we have wonderfully crunchy croquetas with a soft core of warm raclette pink shavings of jamón ibérico and a plate of anchovies three cured in oil and three in brine the quality is impeccable if you can get over paying 18 for six anchovies i couldn t representing sashimi there is shimmering raw seafood some of it on or under squares of nori you re meant to treat the nori like a tortilla a month ago the filling in this taco was raw scallops and a salty streak of plum paste and i was quietly happy when i went back the nori covered sticky raw red shrimp and sea urchin and i went completely giddy it took me a minute to warm up to another raw dish the lobster crudo raw lobster is not something you naturally want to cuddle up with here it is chopped with shiso and molded into a disc ready to be swabbed in a mayonnaise it s refined and almost comforting as for something else you tell me how to characterize raclette and golden slices of rutabaga over a thin buttery tart shell or an omelet that is in fact cooked in a thin disc inverted on to the plate down and then topped with spoonfuls of hackleback caviar firm trout roe and crème fraîche there s a fine line between simple and dull and one or two dishes fell on the wrong side stracciatella with lemon peel and cubes of fennel struck me as an ordinary burrata salad traveling under an alias halibut with wild mushrooms was no more than the sum of its parts although they were very good parts natasha pickowicz s desserts sound safe but can be daring mandarin sorbet in a kind of cradle made of coconut was served with a yuzu sauce so sour it made me sit up straight after the initial shock i loved it if i d expected the parfait of chocolate and amarena cherries to be a layered dessert served in a tall glass like other parfaits i was wrong this was chocolate as dense as ganache and served in the shape of you guessed it a disc ',\n",

visiting ambassador of the united arab emirates wahidullah majrooh a spokesman for the afghan health ministry said 80 injured people and 30 bodies were taken to kabul hospitals many officials feared that the number of casualties would rise the taliban issued a statement claiming responsibility for the parliament bombings one witness who was inside the compound said the attack started when a suicide bomber detonated explosives nearby then as security forces gathered in the area a few minutes later a car bomb detonated on the busy road that passes in front of the compound the witness said he spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters an afghan lawmaker kamal safi said meetings were underway in the compound when the attack took place including one about the national budget the explosions took place exactly at the time when government employees were going home so it was a rush hour mr safi said more than a thousand people are working there so i know the number of casualties are very high an officer named mirwais who was among those providing security for the parliament building said most of the casualties came from a public bus that was passing by the compound when the car bomb exploded it was 4 p m and the workers were leaving they either had private cars or were walking out to the main road for public transport mr mirwais said the second attack happened on the main road by the gate and that caused a lot of casualties violent attacks in afghanistan have not subsided this year despite the harsh winter with taliban assaults reported on a daily basis across several provinces in the north and the south the deteriorating situation in the south in particular prompted the dispatch of about 200 nato military advisers to farah province and in helmand province where american and british troops struggled for years to loosen the taliban s grip at the height of the war 300 united states marines will return to help hold the provincial capital lashkar gah against the insurgents the attacks in kabul came hours after a taliban bomber targeted a meeting of militia commanders in lashkar gah killing seven to 11 people according to various afghan officials the target of that attack revealed the chaotic reality of the province that has been slipping from the hands of the afghan government the bombing hit the house of hajji khudaidad a taliban commander who had recently switched sides to lead a clandestine government force essentially a duplicate taliban to infiltrate insurgency lines afghan officials said col gulai khan the security chief of the province said a meeting was underway at mr khudaidad s house in the city s second precinct when the attack happened the suicide bomber parked his vehicle laden with explosive nearby the house and walked to the house where he shot the watchman who was on duty and later he blew up his explosives inside colonel khan said he said that seven people were killed and three were wounded and that a bomb squad was trying to clear the vehicle other accounts suggested the attacker might have thrown grenades inside and managed to flee before he was tracked down by the police abdul karim attal head of the helmand provincial council however put the number of dead at 11 among the wounded officials said were mr khudaidad and mullah ibrahim a senior commander of a taliban breakaway faction that is believed to have close ties with the government many officials in helmand said the effort to create the militia was being led by abdul jabar qahraman president ashraf ghani s special envoy to the province who used similar militia tactics in the 1980s on behalf of the collapsing communist government at the time mr qahraman in an interview admitted that he was behind creating such a secret force but denied that the group targeted today was part of it it amounts to a desperate attempt to break some of the taliban s momentum the insurgents largely control six districts of the province the government controls two and another six are contested according to bashir ahmad shakir the head of the security committee at the helmand provincial council details about the attack at the governor s guesthouse in kandahar remained scant officials said the governor humayoon azizi was meeting with the visiting ambassador of united arab emirates for an evening reception when explosions went off gen abdul raziq the police chief of kandahar province said bombs had been placed in couches in the governor s house eleven people have been killed and around 12 have been injured including the governor and the u a e ambassador but their conditions are not general raziq said the bodies of the dead are badly burned and beyond recognition ',\n",
       " 'if you re making resolutions for a healthier new year consider a gut makeover refashioning the community of bacteria and other microbes living in your intestinal tract collectively known as the gut microbiome could be a good investment in your health trillions of microbial cells inhabit the human body outnumbering human cells by 10 to one according to some estimates and growing evidence suggests that the rich array of intestinal microbiota helps us process nutrients in the foods we eat bolsters the immune system and does all sorts of odd jobs that promote sound health a diminished microbial ecosystem on the other hand is believed to have consequences that extend far beyond the intestinal tract affecting everything from allergies and inflammation metabolic diseases like diabetes and obesity even mental health conditions like depression and anxiety much of the composition of the microbiome is established early in life shaped by forces like your genetics and whether you were or microbial diversity may be further undermined by the typical american diet rich in sugar meats and processed foods but a new study in mice and people adds to evidence that suggests you can take steps to enrich your gut microbiota changing your diet to one containing a variety of foods the new research suggests may be crucial to achieving a healthier microbiome altering your microbiome however may not be easy and nobody knows how long it might take that s because the ecosystem already established in your gut determines how it absorbs and processes nutrients so if the microbial community in your gut has been shaped by a daily diet of cheeseburgers and pepperoni pizza for example it won t respond as quickly to a healthy diet as a gut shaped by vegetables and fruits that has more varied microbiota to begin with the nutritional value of food is influenced in part by the microbial community that encounters that food said dr jeffrey gordon the senior author of the new paper and director of the center for genome science and systems biology at the washington university school of medicine in st louis nutritional components of a healthy diet have to be viewed from the inside out he said not just the outside in one of the questions the study set out to answer was how individuals with different diets respond when they try to improve their eating habits the scientists harvested gut bacteria from humans transplanted them into mice bred under sterile conditions and then fed the mice either or diets the scientists then analyzed changes in the mice s microbial communities of interest the scientists harvested the gut bacteria from people who followed sharply different diets one group ate a fairly typical american diet consuming about 3 000 calories a day high in animal proteins with few fruits and vegetables some of their favorite foods were processed cheese pepperoni and lunch meats the other group consisted of people who were devotees of calorie restriction they ate less than 1 800 calories a day and had meticulously tracked what they ate for at least two years sticking to a mostly diet and consuming far less animal protein than the other group a third fewer carbohydrates and only half the fat this group the researchers found had a far richer and more diverse microbial community in the gut than those eating a typical american diet they also carried several strains of good bacteria known to promote health that are unique to their diet their choices as adults dramatically influenced their gut community said nicholas w griffin of washington university the paper s lead author the study published in cell host microbe is not the first to report findings suggesting dietary shifts can induce persistent changes in a gut microbial community said dr david a relman a professor of medicine microbiology and immunology at stanford university who was not involved in the current research he noted that other studies had found even more profound effects after the human microbiota was transplanted into the mice the mice got to eat either like typical americans or like the calorie restrictors mice that had a microbiota conditioned by the typical american diet had a weaker response to the diet their microbial communities didn t increase and diversify as much they all responded in a predictable direction but with not as great a magnitude said dr griffin another aspect of the study suggests the company you keep may also enrich your gut microbiota at least in mice at first the animals were kept in separate cages then when they were housed together the microbes from the communities conditioned by plant diets made their way into the microbiome it s not clear how that translates to humans mice eat one another s droppings when they live together so they easily share the bacterial wealth still it s possible humans have other ways of sharing bacteria dr griffin said we know from previous work and other studies that spouses who live together will develop microbial communities that are similar to each other he said perhaps the best way to cultivate a healthier microbiome is to eat more fiber by consuming more fruit vegetables whole grains legumes and nuts or seeds said meghan jardine a registered dietitian who was not involved in the current study but has published articles on promoting a healthy microbiota she is also affiliated with the physicians committee for responsible medicine which recommends a diet she urges people to aim for 40 to 50 grams of fiber daily well above levels recommended by most dietary guidelines when you look at populations that eat real food that s high in fiber and more foods you re going to see they have a more robust microbiota with more genetic diversity healthier species and fewer pathogenic bacteria living in the gut she said ',\n",
       " 'chicago if the metal barricades do not enter signs and lurking secret service agents were a bother the past eight years in the hyde area the south side neighborhood where president obama still owns a house but rarely has been home residents are not complaining all that s been fine really you get used to it said adela cepeda who like many people on mr obama s block of greenwood avenue met him before he was president or a senator or elected to anything at all to me it s just too bad his time will be over this has been fabulous for chicago in a certain way i think that all things being equal we came first but i guess all good things must end as mr obama prepared to give his farewell address on tuesday from mccormick place the cavernous convention center beside lake michigan people in his hometown sounded by turns possessive proud anxious and wistful with his election in 2008 this city and its heavily south side in particular had suddenly been thrust to the forefront of the national political conversation and so early saturday in temperatures barely above zero thousands waited outside for the chance to receive free tickets to witness the end of that story by sunday tickets were being hawked online for as much as 5 000 near the obamas red brick georgian not far from the university of chicago some wondered gloomily whether his legacy might now be erased by his successor donald j trump who received just 12 percent of the vote in chicago and only slivers in the wards near mr obama s house would chicago s spin in the spotlight complicated as it had been at times be over now too i guess i feel sad said antonio coye a barber at the hyde park hair salon where the plain black chair mr obama used to sit in for his trims is now preserved under glass not long ago a crew of bicyclists peered at the chair from the foyer of the small shop where a line of men forms on saturdays and the obama cut a taper on the side and the back for 24 remains popular this was really something unique that happened mr coye said as he worked on a customer with a razor over the weekend it was the first time somebody really different became president and he did a really good job to me the person in office after him is going to make his time in office stand out even more than it did already tour buses once an oddity cruise down hyde park boulevard with some frequency now people can occasionally be seen pulling over with cameras outside a nondescript shopping center along 53rd street where an plaque notes the obamas first date during which barack obama bought michelle robinson ice cream from a shop that has since become a subway for a place that has not forgotten being called the second city by a new yorker writer long ago chicago had watched its standing in the eyes of the coasts rise along with mr obama s chicagoans were entrusted with important posts in washington and many of them along with the first family had roots on the south side rather than on the richer and whiter north side at points during the term chicago voices seemed to be everywhere both valerie jarrett and david axelrod who is now back in hyde park at the institute of politics at the university of chicago were senior advisers chicago cabinet members included arne duncan education and penny pritzker commerce austan goolsbee another hyde parker was an economic adviser and desirée rogers was an early white house social secretary and mr obama s chiefs of staff included william m daley the brother of chicago s former mayor and rahm emanuel who was later elected mayor but it is not just the shutting of that pipeline that causes concern in mr obama s old neighborhood the notion that mr trump was soon to step in left some speaking of the president s farewell speech in terms more akin to a funeral than a celebration many recalled watching an ebullient evening here in 2012 when president obama appeared at mccormick place a bookend it now seems to tuesday night others recounted how they had felt as they watched his 2008 victory from grant park the city s downtown front yard along the lake where he addressed thousands with the gleaming chicago skyline as a backdrop it was a magical moment such a positive buzz all around said kevin elliott a manager at 57th street books an underground maze where mr obama had held book signings and often visited before his election even here though a few have questioned whether mr obama did as much as he could during his time in office to solve urban problems of gang violence joblessness and segregation in chicago violence cascaded last year more people 762 were murdered in the president s hometown in 2016 than in new york and los angeles combined some complained that mr obama had not interceded forcefully enough he was a community organizer here himself and he should be embarrassed that he came in as president and the problems have actually worsened said ja mal green a local activist but others like mr coye the barber noted that mr obama was president of the united states not of the south side who knows what happens now but you can t have expected him to solve this city s violence the obamas intend to stay in washington while their younger daughter finishes high school but many residents here believe that they might never return to the house on greenwood avenue he is building his presidential library in chicago many say and that is just fine no he s not coming back and he shouldn t either he couldn t go anywhere without being recognized said stephanie crouse 53 a school bus driver eating her lunch from a tray at valois a hyde park cafeteria mr obama once frequented this is like your kids she added he s done his thing he did what he could and you re sending him off now to graduate and

       " 'chicago president obama delivering a farewell address in the city that launched his political career declared on tuesday his continued confidence in the american experiment but he warned in the wake of a toxic presidential election that economic inequity racism and threatened to shred the nation s democratic fabric we weaken those ties when we define some of us as more american than others mr obama said when we write off the whole system as inevitably corrupt and when we sit back and blame the leaders we elect without examining our own role in electing them speaking to a rapturous crowd that recalled the excitement of his campaign in 2008 mr obama said he believed even the deepest ideological divides could be bridged his words were nevertheless etched with frustration a blunt coda to a remarkable day that laid bare many of the racial crosscurrents in the country on capitol hill senator jeff sessions of alabama presented himself as a moderate in his confirmation hearing for attorney general while his critics denounced him as a racist in charleston s c dylann s roof the white supremacist who shot nine black churchgoers was sentenced to death and here in the cavernous convention hall where mr obama celebrated his in 2012 the nation s first black president still popular still optimistic bade america goodbye 10 days before turning over his office to donald j trump who ran what his critics labeled a racist campaign mr obama pledged again to support his successor but his speech was a thinly veiled rebuke of several of the positions mr trump staked out during the campaign from climate change and barring muslims from entering the country to repealing his landmark health care law if every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and undeserving minorities mr obama said then workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclave if we decline to invest in the children of immigrants just because they don t look like us we diminish the prospects of our own children because those brown kids will represent a larger share of america s work force he added in giving a farewell address mr obama invoked a privilege of presidents going back to george washington he staked his claim as the leader who steered the nation through the storms of the great recession to a growing economy and job market he claimed credit for reducing the rate of uninsured americans to record lows while keeping a cap on health care costs in a pointed reference to republicans determined to repeal the health care bill that was one of the signature accomplishments of his presidency mr obama said if anyone can put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements we ve made to our health care system that covers as many people at less cost i will publicly support it there were also nostalgic moments as well he recalled the 2008 campaign that started him on his improbable journey to the white house he thanked the army of volunteers and staff members who swept him into the oval office ending with the iconic chant yes we can and reflecting on all they had accomplished he added yes we did it has been the honor of my life to serve you mr obama said i won t stop in fact i will be right there with you as a citizen for all my remaining days he drew some of the most thunderous applause of the night when he paid tribute to his wife michelle my best friend and vice president joseph r biden jr a brother as the crowd of 18 000 clapped and stamped their feet mr obama dabbed his eyes afterward mrs obama and her elder daughter malia appeared onstage with the president along with mr biden and his wife jill the obamas younger daughter sasha stayed in washington because she has an exam in school on wednesday morning the white house said but mr obama clearly wanted to use his last major turn on the national stage to send a message americans he said should not take their democracy for granted lamenting the perennially low voter turnout rates mr obama urged people to become involved if you re tired of arguing with strangers on the internet he said try to talk with one in real life america is not a fragile thing the president said but the gains of our long journey to freedom are not assured the white house had meticulously planned this event from the location to the tone and cadence of the speech which clearly reached for the oratorical heights of his addresses the president was still rewriting his remarks on tuesday afternoon one of his aides said after being up very late monday night scrawling edits on what was then already the fourth draft mr obama s chief speechwriter cody keenan pored over previous farewell addresses for inspiration george washington used the occasion to disclose he would not run for a third term and warned americans to steer clear of foreign entanglements in europe while dwight d eisenhower warned of the influence of the complex mr obama s message recalled his final state of the union address last year as well as speeches he gave in springfield ill at the commencement ceremonies at howard university and rutgers university and during the democratic national convention dozens of alumni from the white house and mr obama s political operation converged on chicago to cheer their boss with parties all over town the atmosphere felt like a wistful version of 2012 or even more so of 2008 when mr obama s election drew a people to a jubilant victory celebration in nearby grant park there was however an undeniable tinge of sadness to mr obama s the dread among many in this crowd that his legacy will be undone by mr trump and the disappointment that for all his political gifts he was unable to hand over his office to his chosen successor hillary clinton beers and tears said ben labolt who served as the national press secretary for mr obama s campaign many said they had waited hours in the cold to get tickets like mcgee an elementary school teacher from the chicago suburb country club hills those hours had a purpose she wanted to demonstrate to her students that seeing mr obama was worth the wait better than waiting to shop on black friday better than waiting in line for gym shoes she said but ms mcgee was troubled by mr trump s inauguration and the damage it could do to mr obama s legacy there s so much to say about him she said he maintained class he maintained dignity honestly i don t want him to leave but i m sure it will be a load off his shoulders alvin love a baptist minister walked through the crowd holding the hand of his granddaughter bayleigh love who wore a red sequined party dress he and mr obama go back 30 years when the president was a young community organizer on the south side it s mixed emotions for me he said i m sad to see it come to an end but proud and happy to see the work that he s done mr love said he believed mr obama s work could be sustained even with the advent of a trump presidency any time right is done it will sooner or later stand up again ',\n",
       " 'last summer the justice department decided to start winding down its use of private prisons deputy attorney general sally q yates noted in a memo that while private prisons were useful when public prisons were overflowing they made little sense now that the prison population was falling they didn t save much on costs nor did they provide the kind of rehabilitation programs proved to reduce recidivism and they are particularly dangerous a recent report by the department s inspector general found that prisoners in private facilities which house some 12 percent of federal inmates were much more likely to have weapons private prisons had many more assaults on inmates and prison workers than those run by the bureau of prisons and they went into lockdown to respond to disturbances 10 times as often but on nov 9 the day after donald j trump was elected president the stocks of correctional conglomerates were among the best performing on the new york stock exchange shares in corrections corporation of america now corecivic gained an astonishing 43 percent on the day the reason privatization is back at the top of the government s agenda while this is being applauded in executive suites across corporate america the cost for the rest of society is likely to be high with prisons i do think we can do a lot of privatizations and private prisons mr trump said on the campaign trail last year it seems to work a lot better mr trump s pick for attorney general senator jeff sessions of alabama is a staunch supporter of the approach having invited private prisons into his state as its attorney general more than 20 years ago but privatization is likely to sweep through not only prisons the wants to privatize health services provided by the department of veterans affairs he wants to privatize public infrastructure drawing private sector companies to fix build and manage bridges and roads water supplies and airports he is selling privatization as a surefire winner that will deliver better services for less public money there s a magical thinking among business executives that something about the profit motive makes everything run better noted raymond fisman a professor of economics at boston university what is government going to be like when it is run by billionaire c e o s that see the private sector as a solution to all the world s problems a serious body of economics not to mention reams of evidence from decades of privatizations around the world suggests this belief is false consider for instance what the profit motive has done for higher education colleges absorb a full quarter of federal aid for higher education not all are fraudulent diploma mills set up to milk federal aid dollars from students still on average they are much more expensive than public institutions while their degrees are much less valuable there are abundant similar examples in the health care industry hospices run for profit are less likely to admit patients with shorter expected lengths of stay hospitals have been found to fib more to medicare than nonprofits do tweaking their diagnoses to get higher reimbursements and they have been found to bolster profits at the expense of patient safety a study at the rand corporation found that hospitals that switched from nonprofit to operation saw a sharp rise in profits but also a jump in mortality rates one to two years after their conversion then there is a study by bonnie svarstad and chester bond of the school of pharmacy at the university of more than three decades ago they found that patients in nursing homes got heavier doses of sedatives than those in nonprofits got explaining the pattern the economist burton weisbrod wrote that sedatives were less expensive than say giving special attention to more active patients who need to be kept busy of course the government can also do a horrible job of running things and private corporations do many things well they tend to be much faster to innovate in competitive markets the profit motive makes for a powerful incentive to deliver all kinds of goods and services from widgets to telephone calls efficiently and effectively a study found that opening nursing homes in sweden to private providers actually improved patients mortality rates but it is critical to understand how profit seeking can go awry giving companies a motivation to skimp on quality to bolster margins when a private provider faces little or no competition or when quality of service is difficult to track properly think of the of patients in a nursing home or the health of prison inmates there will be nothing to stop it from pursuing higher profits at society s expense the private sector is good at cutting costs and finding ways to save money oliver hart a professor of economics at harvard told me some are socially desirable some are not the critical issue is whether a contract can be written that reduces the space for socially undesirable tactics to a minimum negotiating the is not always obvious for instance the privatization of the water supply of buenos aires led to a reduction in infant deaths from infectious and parasitic disease but it also increased water bills so the unpopular concession to a private company was ultimately canceled professor hart as it happens won the nobel in economic sciences last year for his work in studying precisely these sorts of contracts when are they more likely to work how should they be structured crucial tasks with many dimensions waging war policing the streets of a city are often best left to the public sector he points out by contrast a private provider could do a better job when the desired output is more straightforward and can be measured properly like collecting trash he is not at all opposed to privatization indeed he argues that determining whether a service should be privately or publicly provided should not be an ideological issue the decision should be based on what mode of organization achieves the social goal in the best way unfortunately he noted it seems unlikely mr trump s team will take the thoughtful path indeed one of professor hart s seminal papers produced together with andrei shleifer and robert vishny nearly 20 years ago suggested that while things like garbage collection or weapons production were quite suitable for private provision the government would probably do a better job tackling tasks like foreign policy the police and prisons ',\n",

issued early monday evening announcing an appointment that perhaps more than any other defines the way the incoming president will govern mr kushner plans to sell some of his real estate holdings and other assets his lawyer said some ethics experts have questioned whether the appointment will be legal under federal laws designed to prevent family ties from influencing the functioning of the united

of a new york real estate empire with family at the pinnacle and staff members however trusted or talented somewhere below ms trump who also participated in her father s campaign decisions has no immediate plans to enter the administration and will restructure her portfolio of holdings but she plans to step down from the management of the trump organization and the ivanka trump fashion brand said jamie s gorelick mr kushner s lawyer mr kushner s plan is to sell assets to his brother and to a trust overseen by his mother said ms gorelick who added that she had been consulting with federal

added mr kushner has been described by numerous transition staff members as the first among equals in mr trump s high command his new title belies the sweeping influence he will have behind the scenes the mr kushner has often been described as having a calming effect on mr trump who is notorious for yelling at staff members during moments of tension mr kushner became the de facto campaign manager in the spring and his influence with mr trump has expanded rapidly he is expected to play the same role in the white house while the chief strategist stephen k bannon provides the with strategic

       " 'after donald j trump announced monday that he would appoint his the real estate investor jared kushner as a senior white house adviser lawyers for mr kushner said he would sell many of his assets to avoid myriad potential conflicts of interest but because he plans to sell to his brother or to a family trust controlled by his mother some ethics lawyers interviewed questioned how meaningful the divestiture would be jamie s gorelick a lawyer who is advising mr kushner on how to deal with the ethical issues he will have to navigate while advising mr trump on topics that could affect his bottom line said mr kushner would sell his interest in about 35 investments including his family s flagship office tower on fifth avenue in midtown manhattan he also plans to restructure his role in his remaining holdings so he will not be involved in managing them ms gorelick said in addition she said he will sell his common stocks resign as chief executive of kushner companies his family business and sell the new york observer he will also recuse himself from decisions that could affect his remaining holdings as well as those of his wife ivanka trump he will be treated as any other person entering public service said ms gorelick a partner at wilmerhale and a deputy attorney general under president bill clinton matthew t sanderson a lawyer at caplin drysdale and former general counsel to senator rand paul s presidential campaign said that ideally the transactions would be independent of the person selling the asset but as outlined by ms gorelick mr sanderson said the plan falls short of that standard not only does mr kushner intend to sell the assets to his brother joshua a venture capitalist and to a trust controlled by his mother seryl but his mother and siblings are the beneficiaries of the trust it sounds like a shell game to me mr sanderson said even with these measures mr kushner will still have links to his family s empire which owns property across the country and relies on foreign money recent maneuvers over the tower at 666 fifth avenue underscore the complications on saturday the new york times reported that mr kushner had been negotiating to redevelop the building with anbang insurance group a chinese financial firm with a murky ownership structure and state connections the negotiations began about six months ago around the time mr trump clinched the republican nomination while the family trust will take over mr kushner s stake in the building the value of his interest and other details of the transaction are not known and as a white house adviser on issues including trade he is likely to counsel the president on america s relationship with china people close to mr kushner and his wife have repeatedly highlighted the income they will be sacrificing ms gorelick said ms trump would remove herself from management roles at the trump organization and at her apparel and licensing companies she will draw income in fixed payments from the trump organization so her salary will not fluctuate based on deals that could relate directly to new federal laws or decisions by her father s administration ms gorelick said mr kushner s legal team had consulted with the office of government ethics and agreed to certain requests to craft a plan that would satisfy the legal requirements for him to serve the lawyers concluded that at least one obstacle a federal law was not applicable because while the law prohibits federal officials from hiring relatives for agencies they lead the white house is not an agency i m not saying that there isn t an argument on the other side ms gorelick said i just think we have the better argument richard w painter a professor of law at the university of minnesota and a chief white house ethics lawyer under president george w bush said mr trump and his team deserved credit for bringing mr kushner on as an employee rather than as an informal adviser not subject to criminal rules mr painter noted that the trust was irrevocable meaning it cannot be modified without the permission of the beneficiaries he also said it was a positive sign that mr kushner s wife and young children were not beneficiaries however other relatives are there will be appearance issues and you need to make sure this is not a issue he said ',\n",
       " 'tehran iranians bade farewell to ayatollah akbar hashemi rafsanjani on tuesday with the sprawling state funeral veering slightly off script when groups of mourners started shouting opposition slogans the authorities were forced to raise the volume on the loudspeakers playing lamentation songs after some in the crowds took up cries of oh hussein mir hussein a reference to a former presidential candidate mir hussein moussavi who has been under house arrest since 2011 some of the chants were aimed at russia iran s ally in the syrian conflict video clips on social media showed mourners shouting death to russia and the russian embassy is the den of espionage as they passed the embassy s complex in the heart of tehran people also called for the release of hunger strikers in iranian prisons state television broadcasting the funeral live airbrushed the protests which were nevertheless allowed to proceed without police intervention mr rafsanjani 82 who died on sunday was laid to rest after an elaborate ceremony that lasted several days right after his demise his body was placed in a coffin that was put on public display in the modest house of the late founder of the islamic republic ayatollah ruhollah khomeini for two days mourners had filed through the northern tehran site untouched since mr khomeini died in 1989 a religious chanter brought the crowds to tears as he recalled how mr rafsanjani helped to oust shah mohammed reza pahlavi in the 1979 revolution our sheikh was so wise he made the shah leave leave the chanter sang men gathering on the ground floor bowed their heads in respect while on the first floor the women s section mourners in black chadors peeked down qassem soleimani the general of the quds force of the revolutionary guards who runs iran s operations in iraq and syria paid his respects some people said showing clips of him on their cellphones as proof because of mr rafsanjani s close relationship with ayatollah khomeini he was accorded the honor of being buried in the late leader s mausoleum in a golden cage before the interment all iranians were invited to gather around the campus of the university of tehran in the central part of the city where iran s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei led a prayer people showed up early some wearing scarves around their faces to protect them from the morning cold families passed by pushing strollers carrying babies wearing woolen hats students took videos with their cellphones shiite clerics in traditional winter robes made of camel s hair held prayer beads there were so many people 2 5 million by official estimates that many of the dignitaries and family members invited to the campus were marooned in their cars amid the crowds some hid behind curtains others waved at the collection of camera phones one of mr rafsanjani s daughters faezeh hashemi was photographed sticking her head out of the window of a bus and flashing a victory sign she and her brother mehdi have been harassed by for their growing support of reformists and moderates seeking change in iran the daughter an activist for women s rights and personal freedoms was jailed in 2011 for making propaganda while her brother was given leave to attend the funeral from prison where he was sent on embezzlement charges in recent years their father long a staunch conservative became an unexpected hero to iran s middle class mr rafsanjani sympathized with some demands made by protesters during the green revolution the antigovernment demonstrations following the disputed victory of president mahmoud ahmadinejad in 2009 they saw him as a lone voice representing their beliefs in iran s establishment such deviations from the official line were put aside by the authorities on tuesday in death it seemed that mr rafsanjani was to be remembered for his revolutionary credentials not for his criticisms potential troublemakers were not invited the former reformist president mohammad khatami who was supported by mr rafsanjani was told not to attend local websites said the same apparatus that normally churns out posters showing uncle sam with blood dripping from his teeth to burn during demonstrations now printed pictures of mr rafsanjani extolling him as a man of history who is immortal in the teeming streets scenes clashed incongruously at one point ayatollah khamenei could be heard through loudspeakers saying prayers for mr rafsanjani while protesters chanted opposition slogans some wore green wristbands the color of the opposition and flashed victory signs supporters of the establishment tried to drown out the slogans by shouting allahu akbar meaning god is great but for the most part they were overmatched on state television sound engineers at one point forgot to lower the volume when people shouted hail to khatami hashemi s death is a great worry to us said leili farhang a university graduate who emphasized that she was unemployed like many of my generation she and her friends had showed up in front of the tehran university campus to pay respect to a man who respected us it was hard she and her friends agreed to come up with the name of anybody within iran s establishment to replace mr rafsanjani not one has his weight and stature they concluded he will be missed it took hours for the body to arrive at the south tehran mausoleum because of the millions that have come out to honor the ayatollah khabarfori an iranian online news channel said on the telegram messaging app inside the mausoleum state television showed a marching band played the national anthem after which mr rafsanjani s coffin was placed next to mr khomeini s as planned ',\n",

105 was less than a week into her first job as a reporter for the british newspaper the daily telegraph on that windy day in 1939 driving alone on the road from gleiwitz then in germany to katowice in poland a distance of less than 20 miles she watched as the wind lifted a piece of the tarpaulin that had been erected on the german side to screen the valley below from view through the opening ms hollingworth saw she later wrote large numbers of troops literally hundreds of tanks armored cars and field guns concealed in the valley she knew then that germany was poised for a major military incursion hastening back across the border to the polish side she telephoned her editor with the news a world exclusive the date was aug 28 1939 and her article published the next day would become as the british paper the guardian wrote in 2015 probably the greatest scoop of modern times on sept 1 hitler s forces invaded poland marking the start of world war ii for the next four decades ms hollingworth who over the years contributed articles to the telegraph the guardian the international herald tribune and the wall street journal covered world war ii from eastern europe the balkans and north africa the greek and algerian civil wars hostilities between arabs and jews in the waning days of the british mandate in palestine and the vietnam war among other conflicts often under fire occasionally arrested and possessed of such a keen nose for covert information that from time to time she was accused of being a spy both by local governments and by the british ms hollingworth was friend or foe to seemingly everyone in a position of power in the world at midcentury she obtained the first interview with mohammed reza pahlavi after he became the shah of iran in 1941 and what was very likely among the last after he was deposed by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in 1979 in 1965 wanting to cover hostilities between india and pakistan but discovering that reporters were barred from the front she simply secured permission from an old acquaintance indira gandhi who was then india s minister of information and broadcasting ms hollingworth was also one of the first western journalists to report regularly from china opening the telegraph s beijing bureau in 1973 her other major scoops included a 1963 article for the guardian in which she cautiously identified the british intelligence agent kim philby as the third man in the ring of soviet spies then known to include the englishmen donald maclean and guy burgess another was a 1968 article for the telegraph in which she reported the united states incipient plans for peace talks with vietnam the talks opened in paris later that year and were concluded in 1973 ms hollingworth was never so happy she often said as when she was roaming the world equipped with little more than a toothbrush a typewriter and if need be a revolver embedded long before the term was applied to journalists she slept in trucks and in trenches at times buried up to her neck in sand for warmth on cold desert nights she once held off an armed algerian policeman by threatening to hit him about the head with a shoe had her eyesight not begun to fail some 20 years ago it was a life ms hollingworth made clear that she would gladly have continued to the end of her days i must admit that i enjoy being in a war she told the telegraph in 2011 on the eve of her 100th birthday in 1989 though nearly 80 and nominally retired ms hollingworth attired in a safari suit her working uniform of choice for 60 years was spotted in tiananmen square shinnying up a lamppost for a bird view of the government s violent crackdown against civilian protesters she periodically slept on the floor of her home in hong kong well into her 90s just to keep from going soft through all her travels with all their attendant rigors there was only one thing ms hollingworth said that she truly could not abide i do not mind not washing for a week or more she wrote but i do hate getting fleas in my hair her graham greene existence with its typewriter revolver and most particularly its fleas was a far cry from the life her conventional british parents had envisioned for her one of quiet propriety dutiful wifehood charity balls and hunting clare hollingworth was born on oct 10 1911 in knighton in central england outside leicester as a child she enjoyed touring the historic battlefields of england and france with her father who ran the family s boot and shoe factory at her parents insistence the young ms hollingworth attended domestic science college in leicester an experience that did nothing to make the prospect of hearth and home attractive although it is useful to be able to make an omelet she later wrote my domestic science training caused me to hate having anything to do with housework partly in deference to her upbringing she became engaged to a suitable young man though she soon broke off the engagement and further scandalized her parents by announcing her intention to become a journalist my mother thought journalism frightfully low like a trade ms hollingworth said in the 2011 interview with the telegraph she didn t believe anything journalists wrote and thought they were only fit for the tradesmen s entrance in the 1930s ms hollingworth attended the school of slavonic and east european studies in london and afterward studied at the university of zagreb then in yugoslavia working for the league of nations union a peace and social justice group established in britain in 1918 she was dispatched to warsaw there in early 1939 she aided thousands of refugees from the sudetenland the region of czechoslovakia that had been annexed by the nazis in october 1938 arranging travel documents that would let them cross into poland she wrote about their plight for small publications in britain the telegraph learned of ms hollingworth s work in poland and on aug 25 1939 while she was visiting london it hired her as a correspondent assigned to cover the prelude to war in the region she flew to warsaw the next day from warsaw she traveled to katowice commandeering an official car from the british consul general there it was in that car union jack boldly flying that she drove over the border past astonished nazi guards and into germany on aug 28 ms hollingworth s scoop comprised two parts the first was her story of aug 29 about the advent of war the second was her report on the start of the war itself awakened by explosions at dawn on sept 1 ms hollingworth from her quarters in katowice saw german bombers overhead and the flash of artillery fire in the distance she telephoned a friend at the british embassy in warsaw the war has begun she cried are you sure old girl he said her published article notwithstanding ms hollingworth later wrote british officialdom persisted in thinking that war remained weeks away she held the receiver out the window as german tanks roared outside the embassy was persuaded and soon too was her editor ms hollingworth s article on the start of hostilities appeared in the telegraph the next day her work from this period is unbylined few reporters were accorded bylines then a state of affairs she pronounced as being for the best it simultaneously spared her parents familial anxiety and social indignity what followed was more than 40 years of chasing danger for it was in the most dangerous places ms hollingworth often said that the best stories lay traveling with british troops in north africa she was buried in the sands for the night when she awoke to the sounds of a german reconnaissance party a sneeze would have brought death to us all she later wrote she held her breath in the darkness and the party passed unseeing in vietnam a sniper s bullet narrowly missed her head ms hollingworth s first husband vandeleur robinson whom she married in 1936 divorced her for desertion 15 years later when i m on a story i m on a story to hell with

grandnephew and her biographer her survivors include a stepdaughter hilary sandre over time some members of the british press grew alienated by what they saw as ms hollingworth s imperious manner ms hollingworth s snobberies are very tiring her cozy relations with british embassies irritating the english journalist robert fisk wrote reviewing her 1990 memoir front line but she remained a widely admired even venerated figure a recipient of the order of the british empire in 1982 and a perennial fixture at the foreign correspondents club in hong kong where she had made her home since the early 1980s her other books include the three weeks war in poland 1940 there s a german just behind me 1942 the arabs and the west 1952 and mao and the men against him 1985 as ms hollingworth made clear in

       " 'milo yiannopoulos the infamous internet troll donald j trump supporter and editor at breitbart news has compared islam to cancer mocked transgender people and suggested that women who are harassed online should stay off the web last july he was permanently barred from twitter for violating the platform s rules against hate speech and harassment so when threshold editions a conservative imprint at simon schuster gave him a publishing contract the blowback was swift and furious there were calls for a boycott of all of the company s books a vast catalog of some 2 000 titles from 50 imprints some of simon schuster s authors including karen hunter danielle henderson and bradley trevor greive denounced the publisher on social media the chicago review of books said it would not review any of the company s books this year the criticism highlights the minefield that publishers face as they try to court an emerging market of young conservatives who identify with extreme stances on issues like immigration and gender equality positions embodied with devious irreverent glee by mr yiannopoulos that they feel are undermining the nation many liberals and moderates say however those positions amount to outright racism and misogyny and the issue has cast an uncomfortable spotlight on a lucrative but often overlooked niche within the largely publishing world every major publishing house has a conservative imprint penguin random house has two sentinel and crown forum and maintains a stable of authors who may not attend literary festivals or mingle at the national book awards but command a sizable audience in red state america most mainstream publishers try to claim partisan neutrality and publish books across the political spectrum simon schuster for example published hillary clinton s memoir and campaign book as well as mr trump s crippled america but occasionally publishers get dragged into a political scrum this past weekend broadside books a conservative imprint at harpercollins became embroiled in a controversy involving a cnn investigation that found that one of broadside s authors the conservative radio host and columnist monica crowley had plagiarized numerous passages in her 2012 best seller what the bleep just happened ms crowley was recently selected by mr trump to serve in a senior communications role at the national security council in defending ms crowley the trump transition team called the plagiarism charges a politically motivated attack and described harpercollins as one of the largest and most respected publishers in the world invoking the company s stature and reputation as way to lend credibility to the author but on tuesday harpercollins announced it was withdrawing the digital edition of the book until ms crowley revises it with proper attribution placing the publishing house in the awkward position of being at odds with the incoming administration conservative books have been a blockbuster category for publishers for decades dating to the rise of radio and cable in the 1980s the genre exploded during bill clinton s presidency and has thrived in the last eight years under president obama as writers forged a united front as ideological underdogs for publishers the books have been reliable cash cows bill o reilly s historical killing series has more than 17 million copies in print in the weeks leading up to the election the lists were dominated by partisan polemics by dinesh d souza michael savage edward klein and gary j byrne whose book crisis of character sold some 247 000 hardcover copies according to nielsen but now without conservatives filling the role as the voice of opposition the urgency and potency of books will almost certainly be diminished and with the political principles that conservative writers have advocated the repeal of obamacare a crackdown on immigration and the dismantling of environmental regulations set to become the policy goals of a government the commercial future of conservative publishing looks far more unsettled publishers are proceeding cautiously after the election many editors quietly scrapped plans to publish books attacking mrs clinton and canceled other sober reflections on the future of the republican party in the wake of a trump defeat some are planning to release fewer titles in 2017 others are returning to safer topics like ronald reagan or the founding fathers conservative publishing is always a better business when the other side is in power said adam bellow the editorial director of a new political imprint at st martin s press at the same time the ideological identity of the right is murkier than it was before mr trump became the nominee and then the making it harder for conservatives to reach a broad readership will books that hold mr trump accountable to his campaign pledges alienate his supporters and will mainstream republican politicians and pundits appeal to or repel his base will voices from more extreme wings of the republican party find a bigger foothold in publishing further cementing their place in mainstream political discourse in a way it s not surprising that a major publisher wants to appeal to mr yiannopoulos s base of young conservative followers mr bellow who read mr yiannopoulos s proposal but did not bid on the book said he was open to publishing other new voices from the at st martin s donald trump has brought into politics a lot of people who were previously excluded and the boundary of political speech has shifted to the right mr bellow said this is a new force in american politics and they deserve to be heard simon schuster was far from alone in its willingness to embrace mr yiannopoulos according to his literary agent thomas flannery jr who said virtually every major conservative imprint expressed interest threshold which has published books by glenn beck rush limbaugh dick cheney and recently mr trump was appealing to mr yiannopoulos because they don t shy away from publishing controversial figures mr flannery said but the fury simon schuster has encountered underscores the perils publishers face as they tailor their publishing plans to reflect volatile new political realities mr yiannopoulos who is gay and describes himself in interviews as more of a cultural figure than a political one is unlikely to appeal to older or more religious conservatives his book dangerous which will address his relationship to the his role as a crusader and his banishment from twitter is more of a memoir than a new conservative manifesto marji ross the president and publisher of regnery a conservative publishing house said she considered mr yiannopoulos s book proposal but did not pursue it because she felt it would be too polarizing among mainstream conservatives some of our market would have loved it and some of our market would have been very uncomfortable with it ms ross said it is a dilemma many conservative writers and editors are now facing as the political ideology of the right has been injected with populism and nationalism conservative writers and publishers are wrestling with how to reach a wide audience now that a block of readers that was once reliably in lock step philosophically has splintered once dependable formulas for generating best sellers write a book attacking the clintons plug it on fox news repeat may no longer deliver a hit the 2016 election turned the political world upside down and it also turned the publishing world upside down said matt latimer a literary agent at javelin whose clients include conservative writers the audience has fractured a few years ago a paul ryan book was widely embraced by conservative book buyers would trump voters buy a paul ryan book today i don t know authors are also losing a reliable driver of book sales the clintons last year regnery alone had three books that took aim at mrs clinton including its first graphic novel clinton cash adapted from the book by peter schweizer and hillary s america mr d souza s book which sold more than 200 000 copies we had certainly planned to take advantage of those opportunities if hillary clinton had won the election and we looked at several books that we had signed up or considered the day after the election and thought well those aren t going to work ms ross said oftentimes we have said here that what s bad for america is good for regnery book sales regnery has instead pivoted to courting trump voters with forthcoming books like how trump won by the breitbart joel pollak and larry schweikart and a series of deplorables guides to issues like immigration gun control and climate change using a moniker trump s supporters adopted for themselves the mood of our market is far far different with trump as president than it would have been with hillary clinton as president ms ross said it s hopeful but cautious ',\n",

force board for the correction of military records had agreed to change his status this time his discharge would be described as honorable it was a long haul mr spires said on tuesday in phone call from his home in norwalk i got the confirmation that i had been looking for said his husband david rosenberg whom he met in 1956 and married eight years ago his first words were it s about time mr

lesbians from serving openly in the military in 2011 the federal government allowed changes to veterans military records some of which had been labeled undesirable or other than honorable the incentives for doing so were sometimes financial such designations could make it difficult for the men and women who had served to get employment loans or access to veterans benefits but there was another more important reason the respect factor said matt thorn an executive director at legal defense network which helps veterans with the application process needed to reverse such designations i served my country honorably i want that respect and they should have that mr thorn said many go through an application process that can take up to 18 months but for mr spires who recently recovered from pneumonia it took years of effort that will now allow him to have a burial when the time comes with military honors i have to quietly go back into my shell now he said because i am 91 years old and my health is not all it should be i can t take on jobs that require energy because i don t have it anymore but i had it long enough to fight the g d air force and win he said brooke brzozowske a spokeswoman for the air force said the service branch had denied 27 out of 157 requests for upgrades since the policy was repealed we were not necessarily discharging people for just being gay she said it was associated with misconduct if it was a dishonorable discharge the military corrections board first received mr spires s application to get his status upgraded in 2014 but some of his discharge records had been destroyed in a fire in 1973 that also consumed those of other veterans of world war ii the korean war and the vietnam war according to a copy of the records board statement about his case other documents found in 2016 showed he served in the military from 1946 to 1948 when he was discharged from lackland air force base in san antonio to help his case mr spires also filed a lawsuit in federal district court for the district of connecticut in november assisted by the yale law school s veterans legal services clinic the lawsuit asserted that mr spires s rights had been violated after he encountered unreasonable delays in the air force review to change his discharge status to honorable according to the lawsuit and to mr spires account his life as a young chaplain s assistant at the base included playing the organ at services and typing letters to distressed families he attended social events with gay men outside of the base he said at a halloween party in 1947 mr spires dressed in a costume inspired by a sparkly laundry soap someone at the party informed his superiors that he was in drag the lawsuit said he was interrogated by military officials threatened with a and sent to hearings and psychiatrists the suit says he signed a statement saying he had engaged in homosexual acts to end an interrogation the lawsuit said i never did anything on the base in uniform he said i had a whole slew of very good friends who were gay and lived off base we partied together we had wonderful meals together and went to the opera together we lived a very normal life i did not dishonor the air force in any way by my actions mr spires said in the interview he was discharged and sent home to lancaster ohio in civilian clothes over the years he destroyed his military records for fear his catholic family would find out he said he found work in department stores and other jobs he met mr rosenberg in 1956 at a séance in new york they have been companions ever since marrying in 2009 mr spires said the court did not rule on mr spires s lawsuit as the air force board resumed its review of mr spires s application it finally said in its letter last week that he had no misconduct in the military and concluded there was the existence of an injustice its recommendation an honorable discharge dating to march 17 1948 i had a terrible time mr spires said but now i

soon link the two neighborhoods doubling down on their redevelopment all that said detroit is a large city with limited resources it sprawls across 139 square miles two and a half times the size of miami a preponderance of which remain blighted and empty with few prospects for prosperity i made a pilgrimage to sister pie a cozy corner bakery opened a few years ago by a gifted brooklyn transplant in the troubled west village area where more new shops and restaurants have lately settled west village is being advertised as another pocket of resurgence you sometimes even hear the g word gentrification bandied around but drive a block or so from sister pie and you ll still find street after street of houses this is where the new lights come in they re spread all across town the project cost 185 million paid by the city and the state the public lighting authority of detroit backed by the mayor received a critical assist from the obama administration energy department experts advised local officials to swap out the old costly sodium lamps which vandals had been stripping bare for copper wire they recommended led technology investments by the obama administration in lighting have reduced costs making leds feasible for a city like detroit three years ago nearly half the 88 000 streetlights in the city were out of commission the more potent led lights allow the authority to replace those 88 000 old fixtures with 65 000 new ones strong enough for you to read one of those glossy magazines after dark the whole thing came in under budget and on time when was the last time anyone could say that about a major infrastructure project in detroit an example of how good government should work as lorna l thomas chairwoman of the lighting authority put it at the ceremony it s also an example of how one smart decision can have ripple effects some residents here grumbled about fewer lights that said the stronger new ones turn out to save detroit nearly 3 million in electric bills they use aluminum wiring which nobody wants to strip discouraging crime the technology even cuts carbon emissions by more than 40 000 tons a year equivalent to taking 11 000 cars off of your streets shaun donovan mr obama s director of the office of management and budget pointed out at the lighting event as well as putting more money in the city s pockets to do more good things good things like investing in development beyond the core i met with the city s new planning and housing chiefs who outlined a bold agenda to target dense areas like the one around livernois avenue between seven mile road and eight mile road the city s former luxury fashion district homegrown entrepreneurs like rufus bartell catering to a young more population are reviving the avenue mr bartell and his family have opened nearly a dozen businesses along livernois including kuzzo s chicken waffles where he and i convened one recent morning over breakfast the place was mobbed as usual businesses like kuzzo s pretty much had to shut down by dinnertime during the winter when the lights were out mr bartell told me people didn t want to go out to eat or shop after the sun went down he said he gestured out the window toward a shop across the street i own a store that sells furs and leather goods with a customer base that skews older foot traffic almost fell to zero after dark since the lights came on it s up 15 percent across this neighborhood back at sister pie i talked with shannon smith 26 another detroit native who said he had grown up in cody rouge an area on the northwest side of the city where getting to and from the bus stop as a teenager was a nightmare when streetlights failed he and other schoolchildren all across town waited in the dark for buses that often didn t arrive on schedule i was especially vulnerable whenever it snowed because the city didn t clear the sidewalks mr smith recalled city officials told me that since 2014 using federal department of transportation funding detroit has added 80 buses hired dozens of drivers and increased ridership by approximately 100 000 trips a week buses are critical to bringing together the areas of newly targeted development it s one of the cruel many here say racist burdens of life in detroit that automobile insurance rates for city residents are through the roof many can t afford a car like the streetlights buses restore the fabric of the streets and a base line of normalcy i made one last stop at louisiana creole gumbo a restaurant near downtown joe spencer has owned louisiana creole since the early 1980s it catered to neighborhood workers before drug dealers moved in and the lights went out now the lights are on mr spencer said and diners are returning at night but more important he said the lights demonstrate that city hall followed through on a promise residents stopped trusting government and without trust people won t want to settle here or start a business the mayor said he d turn the lights back on he did among ripple effects trust may be the most invaluable as i said one smart design move ',\n",

       " 'the obama administration rushing to secure its environmental legacy has increased protection for a humble bumblebee the bumblebee once common across the continental united states has been designated an endangered species by the fish and wildlife service the country s first bumblebee and the first bee from the lower 48 states to be added to the register seven bees were previously listed as endangered but they are found only in hawaii since the late 1990s the population of the bumblebee has declined by nearly 90 percent a result of a combination of factors including exposure to pesticides climate change habitat loss and disease federal wildlife officials said the species once found in 28 states the district of columbia and two canadian provinces is found today only in small pockets of its habitat the designation will accelerate efforts to protect the bees habitat and to reduce the use of pesticides that are killing them it is the latest in a flurry of efforts to protect the environment and preserve president obama s legacy on climate change in the last month he has issued a permanent ban on offshore oil and gas drilling in large areas of the arctic and much of the eastern seaboard announced two new national monuments in utah and nevada protecting 1 65 million acres of federal land and denied six permits for oil exploration in the atlantic partly because the seismic testing harms marine animals and the announcement about the bee came a day after the fish and wildlife service said that climate change is the biggest threat to the polar bear s survival and that without significant action to fight global warming the bears will most likely vanish federal wildlife officials noted that the process of listing a species as endangered can take years sometimes even decades more than 300 species have been listed during the obama administration second only to the more than 500 species listed under president bill clinton during the george w bush administration just 62 species were added to the list noah greenwald endangered species director for the center for biological diversity an environmental advocacy group said activists were worried that we re headed into another period like that where hostility from the administration toward protecting endangered species causes them to shut the listing program down the incoming trump administration however would need to undertake a lengthy process to declare the bumblebee population recovered if it wished to reverse this week s decision and it would be required by law to justify its action on scientific grounds the role of these bees and other insects is important tom melius the fish and wildlife service s midwest regional director said in a statement pollinators are small but mighty parts of the natural mechanism that sustains us and our world he said without them our forests parks meadows and shrub lands and the abundant vibrant life they support cannot survive and our crops require laborious costly pollination by hand around the world the populations of bees butterflies and other insects that promote plant growth are crashing a threat not only to biodiversity but also to the global food supply a study last year from a group associated with the united nations warned that an increasing number of species that aid the growth of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of food each year face extinction obviously it s sad that anything has to get on the endangered list but this really provides a great opportunity said dennis vanengelsdorp of the university of maryland a bee expert who applauded the government s decision when you re talking about saving the bumblebees what you re really talking about is saving the community the kinds of measures that could protect the bumblebee could help many other pollinators as well by restoring habitats and food sources and restricting the use of pesticides especially insecticides that have been linked to the decline in bee species such measures are especially important with native bumblebees dr vanengelsdorp noted as opposed to honeybees which are maintained in large colonies and trucked around the country for commercial pollination the service is reviewing three other species of bees to determine whether they ought to be listed as endangered as well franklin s bumblebee the western bumblebee and the bumblebee when a species is listed as endangered the fish and wildlife service is required to design a recovery plan which is often carried out by other agencies nongovernmental organizations universities and tribes other federal agencies have to check that their actions will not hurt an endangered species or its habitat particularly when it comes to land use planning bumblebees are particularly effective pollinators because though they seem to prefer native flowers they will pollinate pretty much anything and can fly in lower temperatures and lower light conditions than many other insects they also use the technique of buzz pollination in which they grab the part of the flower in their jaws and vibrate their wings shaking the pollen loose a process that seems to benefit plants like tomatoes peppers and cranberries according to the fish and wildlife service bumblebees are particularly important to agriculture but agriculture is often unkind to them a number of factors have reduced the habitat available to bees including the use of pesticides and other chemicals the domination of vast amounts of farmland by a single crop and the use of some genetically modified crops and herbicides that prevent the growth of weeds in fields and wildflowers along their borders climate change may also be shrinking the bees habitat because of drought rising temperatures more storms and mismatches in timing plants may start to flower at times when the bees are not ready to pollinate it also presents serious threats to the migration patterns of monarch butterflies and other pollinators such as honeybees while these species may not be as visible or as charismatic as polar bears or other mammals whose existences are threatened by a changing climate placing them on the endangered list is a victory for the species and those who fight for it now we have a symbol to rally around dr vanengelsdorp said ',\n",

       " 'tehran the hunger strike a pressure tactic of used by political protesters around the world is forcing iran s powerful judiciary to reconsider the conditions of at least one of its inmates after several started fasts that are leading to widespread support on social media the exact number of hunger strikers in iranian prisons is unclear but according to human rights organizations and reports in local media outlets seven inmates sentenced for crimes against the state have refused to eat for intervals ranging from several weeks to more than two months their backgrounds vary but they include an antigovernment protester a children s rights activist an ayatollah a spiritual leader and a lebanese computer technology specialist convicted of espionage it is not possible to verify their conditions because of restrictions preventing foreign reporters from visiting iranian prisons without permission while some members of iran s parliament have said on their social media accounts that they are investigating the reports other officials have dismissed the hunger strikes as plots organized by foreign opposition groups conservative critics further argue that the extensive support for the hunger strikers seen on social media networks is an exaggeration created by automated messages one of the inmates arash sadeghi stopped his strike last tuesday after the judiciary met his demand to temporarily release his imprisoned wife she was transferred back to prison on saturday said the couple s lawyer amir raeesian refusing to eat to protest conditions in prison is illegal in iran but is not uncommon however the number of inmates now simultaneously fasting in combination with a large social media campaign is unusual in the country it also providing a publicity platform for those in prison iranian analysts say the success is clearly motivating others to join said nader karimi joni a journalist close to the reformist factions in iran two of the hunger strikers mr sadeghi and ali shariati have been convicted of crimes against the state charges that by western standards would make them political prisoners they went for nearly 70 days without food advocates say surviving on water and salts mr sadeghi received a sentence last year for offenses like provoking protest gatherings conniving with counterrevolutionaries against the system making propaganda against the system insulting supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei and insulting the sharia his lawyer mr raeesian said the system is an iranian ideological term for the country s political establishment a coterie of clerics commanders and revolutionary comrades mr sadeghi s sentence is lengthy even by iranian standards and reflects what rights activists regard as a new trend in which relatively unknown offenders receive long sentences often as a warning to others he began his fast on oct 24 after his wife golrokh started serving a prison term for an unpublished story found on her private computer about a woman watching a film about a stoning and burning a quran in anger afterward she was convicted on blasphemy charges mr shariati 30 is serving a sentence for his involvement in a 2014 protest supporting the female victims of acid attacks he is demanding to be released their ordeals have galvanized supporters to highlight the hunger strikes on messaging platforms using hashtags like savearash and sosali both became worldwide trending topics on twitter the use of the hunger strike in iran has in some ways put the government in an embarrassing position as it exalted the northern ireland hunger strikers who once vexed the british the embassy of britain in tehran is on bobby sands street renamed for the provisional i r a member who was imprisoned in northern ireland and died in 1981 after refusing to eat for 66 days an iranian journalist reza dehaki a supporter of his country s hunger strikes noted that incongruity in the regulations for iranian prisons hunger strike is against the law but we have a street named after bobby sands the most renowned person who went on hunger strike contradiction savearash mr dehaki wrote on his twitter account last monday a group of around 50 activists ignoring the dangers that come with organizing unauthorized protests in iran gathered in front of tehran s evin prison where mr sadeghi and mrs are being held and called for their release a day later iran s judiciary capitulated to a crucial demand of mr sadeghi abbas jafari dolatabadi tehran s prosecutor announced that mrs would be given a leave from prison mr sadeghi ended his fast after 72 days he was brought to a hospital saturday after four days said his lawyer mr raeesian the judiciary dominated by iran s is engaged in a barely veiled battle with the government of president hassan rouhani which is seeking to limit its powers some say the hunger strikes have been organized with mr rouhani s tacit support to embarrass the judiciary last month mr rouhani released what he called a citizenship rights charter that outlined the personal freedoms of iranians the government by giving out such charters is adding fuel to the fire of the hunger strikes said hamidreza taraghi a political analyst these are all opportunities for outsiders to apply new pressure on iran the other hunger strikers are in prisons scattered across the country information on their conditions is leaking out through human rights organizations and local opposition websites one of the inmates ayatollah mohammad reza nekounam was reported to have been hospitalized on saturday after 15 days of fasting according to his website he is accused of having relations with spirits but supporters say he has been critical of the religious establishment a children s rights activist saeed shirzad 27 has vowed not to eat for at least a month and supporters say he had his lips sewn closed an open letter with his name on it published on a kurdish website said he was protesting the lack of basic rights for prisoners mehdi kukhian and karim chaichian imprisoned for spreading propaganda over the internet have been on hunger strike for the last three weeks according to oyan news a website promoting the azari language that the iranian authorities have sought to block another hunger striker a spiritual healer named mohammad ali taheri is accused of leading a cult his supporters say the lebanese man sentenced to 10 years for spying nizar zakka started a hunger strike on dec 8 according to the international campaign for human rights in iran a group based in new york for inmates refusing to eat is sometimes the only way to be heard one prominent iranian human rights lawyer said to do a hunger strike is a last resort for inmates and political prisoners who are arrested at midnight interrogated in unknown jails under horrible pressures while their families witnessing the ordeals from afar what can they do but go on hunger strike said the lawyer nasrin sotoudeh who was imprisoned herself for several years it is incredibly hard but in some cases it leads to success in 2012 while serving a sentence mrs sotoudeh went on a hunger strike for 49 days after authorities refused to allow her daughter to leave the country she fell into fragile health drinking only water mixed with salts and sugar her weight dropped to 95 pounds it was the second time that ms sotoudeh had stopped eating she declared her first hunger strike in 2010 after her family was forbidden to visit or make phone calls in that showdown the authorities capitulated after four weeks allowing her husband and two children to visit weekly mrs sotoudeh who was given the sakharov prize for freedom of thought by the european parliament in 2012 said she was haunted by the deprivations of those protests even though she prevailed i am over 50 years old and i have sustained several diseases suffered pains for different reasons physically she said but i should say the hunger strike was the most painful experience which i have suffered in my life and i will never forget it ',\n",
       " 'the best cigarette you will ever smoke gregor hens writes in his new memoir nicotine is the relapse cigarette it tastes better he adds the longer the prior abstinence this is dangerous knowledge more than a few smokers relapsed after sept 11 others did after the recent presidential election as if heeding the poet james dickey s dictum that guilt is magical some of us barely keep the urge at bay there s a dark sliver in a former smoker s mind that for dire events so as to justify lighting up again but it s not as if we need large cues mr hens writes when small ones will do every form of cigarette ad gives me a pang of longing every carelessly cigarette packet at a bus stop every cigarette butt every beautiful woman holding a cigarette between her fingers or just looking like she could be holding one he writes my reading chair in columbus gives me a pang and m s balcony in berlin and my old jeep because i ve smoked some of the best cigarettes while driving mr hens is a german writer and translator who has lived and taught in the united states nicotine is the first of his own books to be issued in english it s a hybrid volume part memoir part philosophical lament it doesn t always click there are passages i saw myself as a part of a field of tension that in this translation by jen calleja veer close to psychobabble but when nicotine stays dry earthy and combustible like a virginia tobacco blend it has a lot to say and says it well the author does not resemble your idea of a former serious smoker there mr hens is and dimpled in his author photo on the back flap he looks as if he were ready to bag organic carrots during his weekend stint at the food indeed he writes he is a serious cyclist a participant in triathlons and a member of the german alpine association he s been a health nut all along at least in between long bouts of smoking i can t decide if this is suspicious or insane like that famous photograph of the kansas city chiefs quarterback len dawson taking a deep drag on a cigarette in the locker room during halftime of super bowl i in 1967 i ve smoked well over a hundred thousand cigarettes in my life and each one of those cigarettes meant something to me mr hens writes he goes on i ve smoked cold cigarette butts cigars cigarillos bidis kreteks spliffs and straw i ve missed flights because of cigarettes and burnt holes in trousers and car seats i ve singed my eyelashes and eyebrows fallen asleep while smoking and dreamt of cigarettes of relapses and fires and bitter withdrawal he sees this book as a chance finally to put the urge behind him to comprehend it seal it and bury it he writes about his childhood his father smoked so much that the author thought smoking was the older man s job his mother a stylish woman who drove a range rover smoked more when she was depressed there s a faded romance in the european brand names of the cigarettes he or his family members smoked finas kyriazi frères kims murattis filterless senior services erntes van nelle halfzwares this book takes us to unusual and evocative locations too such as the frisian island of borkum mr hens recounts a drive to the german city of balderschwang which sounds like a word an american politician would utter when something livelier than poppycock was required he is especially good on how those who quit become vicarious smokers sometimes i walk around the city and imagine that others are smoking on my behalf he writes i silently thank the smokers in front of the cafes and office buildings and in smoking areas imagining that they do it for me for my inner contentment i have people smoke for me like any author worth reading mr hens is sometimes best when he goes dispatching obiter dicta he is brutal about the midwest the most insignificant city in the united states is columbus ohio he s interesting about aphorisms and our need to attach them usually erroneously to famous people he considers how often we utter the phrase no worries when in fact we are murderously aggrieved he charts the passing of time by noting how the white tennis balls of his youth have become neon green this book is not a deep dive into smoking and literature or into smoking and films he doesn t go out of his way to conjure the romance of two lit cigarettes and a corner table nicotine mostly omits the social pleasures of smoking mr hens is with a metaphorical carton of american spirits under his arm a smoking section of one his lapidary prose will sometimes put you in mind of the norwegian writer karl ove knausgaard s though mr knausgaard is generally more penetrating the small photographs in nicotine recall the images in some of w g sebald s books this edition of nicotine includes an introduction by the english writer will self that belongs in the hall of fame of bad introductions mr self never has his name seemed so apt tries to mr hens by bragging at length about his own peerless nicotine addiction this introduction is profitably torn out the way smokers of unfiltered cigarettes tear the filters from marlboros this seems like the place to mention that mr hens compares the cottony insides of a cigarette filter perfectly to artichoke hair someday surely smoking will be outlawed who will smoke the last unfiltered camel some of us who quit years ago like to imagine that we will start again at

       " ' donald j trump on wednesday conceded for the first time that russia had carried out cyberattacks against the two major political parties during the presidential election but he angrily rejected unsubstantiated reports that moscow had gathered compromising personal and financial information about him that could be used for extortion in a chaotic news conference in the lobby of trump tower in manhattan nine days before he is to be sworn in as the nation s 45th president mr trump compared united states intelligence officials to nazis sidestepped repeated questions about whether he or anyone in his presidential campaign had had contact with russia during the campaign and lashed out at the news media and political opponents arguing that they were out to get him as far as hacking i think it was russia mr trump said his first comments accepting the conclusions of united states intelligence officials that moscow had interfered in the election to help him win but the expressed little outrage about that breach and seemed to cast doubt on russia s role moments after acknowledging it asserting that it could have been others also he also quoted a kremlin denial tuesday night of reports that it had gathered damaging information to compromise mr trump they said it totally never happened mr trump said of president vladimir v putin of russia and his government i respected the fact that he said that the news conference displayed the showmanship combativeness and sensitivity to criticism that mr trump exhibited throughout the 2016 presidential campaign and underscored his reflex to rebut any criticism or question about his conduct in his maligning of the nation s intelligence agencies journalists and hillary clinton the indicated that he would conduct himself the same way in the white house using the same boastful tone that characterized his campaign rallies mr trump asserted that his victory in november had vindicated his view that he should not release his tax returns an issue that he said only the news media cared about not the public i won he said i don t think they care at all in a pew research center poll this month 60 percent of respondents said mr trump should release his returns although just 38 percent of republican respondents said he should some moments bordered on bizarre for the next president of the united states mr trump spoke of his awareness as a businessman that there were hidden cameras in hotel rooms in moscow and other foreign capitals he called himself very much of a germaphobe apparently in an effort to discredit unsubstantiated claims about sex videos with mr trump and prostitutes in a russian hotel does anyone really believe that story he said calling it phony stuff that never happened at one point mr trump got into a confrontation with a correspondent for cnn which was among the first to report on the allegations saying to him you are fake news moments later though mr trump called on another cnn correspondent a person who identified himself as a correspondent for rt the russian news organization that american intelligence agencies deem a russian propaganda tool shouted repeatedly in vain attempts to draw mr trump s attention mr trump voiced only faint concern about what united states intelligence officials said was a campaign by mr putin to meddle in american democracy he reserved his sharpest condemnation for american intelligence officials who he said had failed to keep secret the accusations that could be damaging to him on wednesday the director of national intelligence james r clapper jr said he had spoken with mr trump that evening and expressed his profound dismay over the leaks of unsubstantiated information he said he had emphasized that this information was not a u s intelligence community product and that the intelligence agencies had not determined that it was reliable he said he did not believe that the leaks had come from the intelligence agencies the asked at the news conference whether he believed that mr putin had directed the hacking effort to help him win the presidency said if putin likes donald trump i consider that an asset not a liability because we have a horrible relationship with russia he shouldn t be doing it mr trump said later of the russian president he won t be doing it russia will have much greater respect for our country when i m leading than when other people have led it of the intelligence officials who will soon serve him mr trump said i think it was disgraceful disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out that s something that nazi germany would have done and did do he did not address whether the sanctions president obama imposed on moscow for the cyberattacks should stay or be strengthened as some republicans have urged especially as the scope of the hacking has become clearer the hourlong news conference mr trump s first in nearly six months touched not only on reports of espionage and attempted blackmail but also on potential conflicts of interest with mr trump s vast business empire and questions about domestic policy the glut of questions for the gave him an advantage in navigating the exchange he interrupted inquiries about russia s hacking to introduce a lawyer sheri l dillon who spoke at length about how mr trump would organize his business affairs and explain why he was not divesting from his global business empire trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built ms dillon said mr trump offered glimpses of his plans for his first days in office including pledging to choose a supreme court nominee within two weeks of inauguration day to succeed justice antonin scalia and to invite journalists to watch a series of signings at the white house an apparent allusion to the several executive orders he has promised to sign to roll back major pieces of mr obama s agenda calling himself the greatest that god ever created mr trump pledged to continue leaning on american companies to keep jobs in the united states he took particular aim at the pharmaceutical industry which he said has been disastrous and had been getting away with murder on drug pricing taking on a powerful lobby that republicans have long defended mr trump said he wanted the federal government to use its purchasing power to negotiate drug prices for medicare and medicaid a proposal long favored by democrats but he broke starkly with democrats over the affordable care act as he repeated a promise to submit a plan to repeal and replace the law essentially simultaneously as soon as representative tom price his choice to be secretary of health and human services is confirmed obamacare is the democrats problem mr trump said wednesday we could sit back and let them hang with it we are doing the democrats a great service he also insisted despite repeated denials by mexican officials that mexico would pay to build a wall on the southern border of the united states to block foreigners from entering illegally mr trump said vice mike pence was working with federal agencies to begin construction quickly and asserted that mexico would ultimately reimburse the cost through a tax or other payment mexico s president enrique peña nieto reiterated wednesday that his country would not pay for the wall but said it would invest in more border security in front of mr trump was a table stacked with manila folders that he said contained paperwork for a portion of the companies being put into a trust to be controlled and run by his eldest sons eric and donald jr and a trustee they stood to his side along with his daughter ivanka trump who also announced on wednesday that she would sever ties with the trump organization and her own company closing the news conference mr trump even got in a veiled plug for his former reality show the apprentice he remains an executive producer of the current version

       " 'times reporters provided analysis and fact checks of donald j trump s news conference donald j trump made an important concession about russia he criticized american intelligence officials he sparred with reporters and denounced fake news and that was all before he arrived at the ostensible reason for holding his first formal news conference since july his plans to extricate himself from the operations of his vast business holdings here are the highlights from the whirling hourlong news conference inside trump tower mr trump said that after his briefing on friday with american intelligence officials he now thought russia was behind the effort to hack his election opponents as far as hacking i think it was russia mr trump said however later in the news conference mr trump wavered slightly when pressed on the matter but you know what it could have been others also he said when asked why he had been so critical of american intelligence officials he harshly criticized the publication of unverified reports that claimed russia has salacious information about his behavior and finances i think it was disgraceful disgraceful that the intelligence agencies let any information that turned out to be so false and fake out he said explaining his twitter post comparing the united states to nazi germany he said of the leaks that s something that nazi germany would have done and did do mr trump added that buzzfeed which published the memos in their entirety is a failing pile of garbage that would suffer the consequences for publishing the uncorroborated report mr trump said he was untroubled by other intelligence reports that have been made public which said russia preferred him over hillary clinton and that president vladimir v putin ordered the election meddling to benefit him if putin likes donald trump guess what folks that is called an asset not a liability he said he added that a strong relationship could allow the two nations to work together on difficult international issues when asked whether he had a message for mr putin mr trump said he shouldn t be doing it he won t be doing it russia will have much greater respect for our country when i am leading it he added there s no reset button we re either going to get along or we re not but he did not address a question about whether he or anyone on his campaign staff had had contact with russia during the campaign mr trump swatted away allegations included in the uncorroborated reports he said that when traveling he warns his aides and bodyguards be very careful because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go you re gonna probably have cameras he also added apparently referring to a detail in the report about supposed sex videos with prostitutes i m also very much of a germaphobe believe me discussing the topic the news conference was intended to address mr trump said he would not divest from his vast business holdings as he takes office instead the will turn over the operations and control of those holdings to a trust controlled by his eldest sons eric trump and donald trump jr the said that he had considered letting the affordable care act implode on its own and letting democrats take the political hit he said would follow but he said he had decided on a more forthright strategy repeal and replace almost simultaneously mr trump was short on details but clearer in his intention to try to keep democrats responsible we don t want to own it politically he said mr trump said that he had asked david j shulkin a current under secretary at the department of veterans affairs to lead that agency after his team had interviewed at least 100 people in the search for a secretary near the end of the news conference mr trump got into a shouting match with jim acosta of cnn who tried to press the into taking a question since you were attacking our news organization can you give us a chance mr acosta asked to which mr trump replied your organization s terrible and don t be rude before dismissing the request once and for all you are fake news cnn was the first to report that mr trump and president obama had been briefed by intelligence officials on the uncorroborated documents but the network did not publish them sean spicer the incoming white house press secretary spoke first to address the publication of the unverified reports by buzzfeed on tuesday mr spicer called the reports a frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible attack on mr trump and a sad pathetic attempt to get clicks mr spicer said the documents were not an intelligence report and were categorically false vice mike pence followed mr spicer and amplified his condemnation of news reports by buzzfeed and other news outlets which he said were irresponsible and aimed at discrediting mr trump s legitimate election victory mr trump began by thanking news organizations that did not report what he called the nonsense that was released he said he has great respect for freedom of the press and all of that mr trump said that the document was released by maybe the intelligence agencies who knows which would be a tremendous blot on their record he went on to cast blame on the democratic national committee for the hacking he praised the republican national committee for having better defenses and commended reince priebus his incoming chief of staff who was the committee chairman mr trump reiterated his description of the report printed by buzzfeed as fake news saying he did not think mr putin had compromising information about him or the republican party i ll be honest if he did have something he would have released it he said he denied that he has any business dealings in russia i tweeted out that i have no dealings with russia i have no deals in russia i have no deals that could happen in russia because we ve stayed away and i have no loans with russia as a real estate developer i have very very little debt mr trump said he had requested that the intelligence agencies produce a major report on hacking defense to be delivered 90 days after he takes office including an examination of this situation with russia and other incidents of hacking sheri a dillon a lawyer for mr trump took the stage to describe how her client would turn over his business assets to a trust trump wants there to be no doubt in the minds of the american public that he is completely isolating himself from his business interests she said adding that mr trump s sons will make all decisions for the company without any involvement whatsoever from mr trump she said mr trump would resign from all positions he holds with the trump organization as would his daughter ivanka ms dillon said that the trump organization would be allowed to make no new foreign deals during the presidency and that any new domestic deals would be subject to strict restrictions he will only know of a deal if he reads about it in the paper or sees it on tv ms dillon said referring to mr trump she also said an ethics adviser would be appointed to the management team of the trump organization ms dillon argued that selling mr trump s business would prove more difficult and create more ethical quandaries than the plan that the trump organization had chosen a totally blind trust she said would likewise be impossible under the circumstances and she added trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built ms dillon laid out what amounts to the trump administration s interpretation of the constitution s emoluments clause which prohibits government officials from taking payments or gifts from a foreign government no one would have thought when the constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument she said to avoid any appearances of violations ms dillon said mr trump had pledged to donate to the united states government all profits made by his hotels from payments by foreign governments mr trump was flanked by a table piled high with manila folders that he said contained paperwork that he had signed turning over control of the trump organization to his sons mr trump joked that if his sons failed to do a good job managing the company during his time in office he would turn to them and say you re fired in other comments about his businesses mr trump said he had been offered deals worth 2 billion worth in dubai in the united arab emirates over the weekend but had turned them down asked about his tax returns mr trump said he was still not releasing them because they are under audit he said that the american people did not care about the documents anyway the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters mr trump said mr trump said he was looking forward to his inauguration it s going to be a beautiful event he

factories in the midwest mr trump said carrier s decision to keep jobs in indiana sent a clear signal to other companies thinking of moving production overseas the word is now out he said repeating a call for a major border tax on these companies that are leaving about that wall i don t feel like waiting a year a year and a half i want to start building he said he reiterated that mexico would reimburse the cost but he added cryptically that it probably wouldn t be in the form of a payment turning to the supreme court mr trump said he expected to announce a nominee to fill the court s vacant seat two weeks or so after he takes office mr trump was asked how he would reform the news media he criticizes frequently i don t recommend reforms he said i recommend people that have some moral compass he added i will tell you some of the media outlets that i deal with are fake news more so than anybody ',\n",
       " ' how did american intelligence officials come to brief president obama donald j trump and lawmakers about supposed russian plans to blackmail mr trump there are far more questions than answers but here is a look at the story so far in september 2015 a washington political research firm fusion gps paid by a wealthy republican donor who did not like mr trump began to compile opposition research on him standard practice in politics last june after evidence of russian hacking of democratic targets surfaced fusion gps hired a retired british intelligence officer christopher steele to investigate mr trump s ties to russia after it became clear that mr trump would be the republican nominee democratic clients who supported hillary clinton began to pay fusion gps for this same opposition research mr steele who had long experience in russia and a network of connections there compiled dozens of reports detailing what he heard from his contacts the memos he wrote mostly one to three pages long are dated from june to december the memos contain unsubstantiated claims that russian officials tried to obtain influence over mr trump by preparing to blackmail him with sex tapes and bribe him with business deals they also claim that the trump campaign met with russian operatives to discuss the russians hacking and leaking of emails and documents from the democratic national committee and from mrs clinton s campaign chairman john d podesta fusion gps and mr steele shared the memos first with their clients and later with the f b i and multiple journalists at the new york times and elsewhere the memos totaling about 35 pages also reached a number of members of congress last week when the f b i c i a and national security agency gave a classified report on the russian hacking leaking and efforts to influence the presidential election to mr obama mr trump and congressional leaders they attached a summary of the unverified allegations in the memos whether any of the claims in the memos are true american intelligence agencies have not confirmed them and mr trump has said they are a complete fabrication in addition one specific allegation that mr trump s lawyer michael cohen met with a russian official in prague in august or september has been denied by both mr cohen who says he has never been to prague and the russian oleg solodukhin who concocted the information in the memos if it is entirely false or partly so and with what purpose if all the information in the dossier is false it is a very sophisticated fabrication what exactly prompted american intelligence officials to pass on a summary of the unvetted claims to mr obama mr trump and congress officials have said they felt the should be aware of the memos which had circulated widely in washington but putting the summary in a report that went to multiple people in congress and the executive branch made it very likely that it would be leaked the f b i has been investigating the claims in the memos and democrats are demanding a thorough inquiry into the reports that trump representatives met with russian officials during the campaign but as of jan 20 mr trump will be in charge of the bureau and the other intelligence agencies and he may not approve such an investigation because the 35 pages of memos prepared as opposition research on mr trump contain detailed claims that neither the intelligence agencies nor the times has been able to verify times editors decided to briefly summarize the claims and not publish the document the times did report before the election that the f b i was investigating claims about mr trump s ties to russia an article that resulted from an extensive reporting effort the democratic national committee and podesta emails were public their authenticity was not in doubt and they contained newsworthy information that is a question the director james b comey may eventually have to answer his two public statements about the bureau s investigation of the clinton emails broke with long f b i tradition many reporters from multiple news organizations tried to verify the claims in the memos but were unsuccessful cnn broke the news that a summary of the memos had been attached to the classified report by the f b i c i a and national security agency on the russian hacking and leaking and that it had been given to mr obama mr trump and congressional leaders last week that level of official attention prompted news organizations to decide to inform the public about the memos ',\n",
       " 'washington the chiefs of america s intelligence agencies last week presented president obama and donald j trump with a summary of unsubstantiated reports that russia had collected compromising and salacious personal information about mr trump two officials with knowledge of the briefing said the summary is based on memos generated by political operatives seeking to derail mr trump s candidacy details of the reports began circulating in the fall and were widely known among journalists and politicians in washington the summary first reported by cnn was presented as an appendix to the intelligence agencies report on russian hacking efforts during the election the officials said the material was not corroborated and the new york times has not been able to confirm the claims but intelligence agencies considered it so potentially explosive that they decided mr obama mr trump and congressional leaders needed to be told about it and informed that the agencies were actively investigating it intelligence officials were concerned that the information would leak before they informed mr trump of its existence said the officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about it publicly the author of the memos is christopher steele a former british intelligence officer with who once served in moscow after mr steele retired in 2009 he founded a private firm called orbis business intelligence in london former c i a officials described him as an expert on russia who is well respected in the spy world on tuesday night mr trump responded to the memos on twitter in an appearance recorded for nbc s late night with seth meyers mr trump s spokeswoman kellyanne conway said of the claims in the opposition research memos he has said he is not aware of that on wednesday a spokesman for president vladimir v putin of russia dismissed the allegations the kremlin has no compromising dossier on trump such information isn t consistent with reality and is nothing but an absolute fantasy the spokesman dmitri s peskov said at a news conference since the intelligence agencies report on friday that mr putin of russia had ordered the hacking and leaks of democratic emails in order to hurt his democratic opponent hillary clinton and help mr trump the and his aides have said that democrats are trying to mar his election victory the decision of top intelligence officials to give the president the and the gang of eight republican and democratic leaders of congress and the intelligence committees what they know to be unverified defamatory material was extremely unusual the appendix summarized opposition research memos prepared mainly by a retired british intelligence operative for a washington political and corporate research firm the firm was paid for its work first by mr trump s republican rivals and later by supporters of mrs clinton the times has checked on a number of the details included in the memos but has been unable to substantiate them the memos suggest that for many years the russian government of mr putin has looked for ways to influence mr trump who has traveled repeatedly to moscow to investigate real estate deals or to oversee the miss universe competition which he owned for several years mr trump never completed any major deals in russia though he discussed them for years mr steele who gathered the material about mr trump is considered a competent and reliable operative with extensive experience in russia american officials said but he passed on what he heard from russian informants and others and what they told him has not yet been vetted by american intelligence the memos describe sex videos involving prostitutes with mr trump in a 2013 visit to a moscow hotel the videos were supposedly prepared as kompromat or compromising material with the possible goal of blackmailing mr trump in the future the memos also suggest that russian officials proposed various lucrative deals essentially as disguised bribes in order to win influence over mr trump the memos describe several purported meetings during the 2016 presidential campaign between trump representatives and russian officials to discuss matters of mutual interest including the russian hacking of the democratic national committee and mrs clinton s campaign chairman john d podesta if some of the unproven claims in the memos are merely titillating others would amount to extremely serious potentially treasonous acts one of the opposition research memos quotes an unidentified russian source as claiming that the hacking and leaking of democratic emails was carried out with the full knowledge and support of trump and senior members of his campaign team in return the memo said the trump team had agreed to sideline russian intervention in ukraine as a campaign issue because mr putin needed to cauterize the subject michael cohen a lawyer and adviser to mr trump also went to twitter to deny a specific claim in the opposition research involving him one of the memos claims that mr cohen went to prague in august or september to meet with kremlin representatives and to talk about russian hacking of democrats mr cohen tweeted on tuesday night in addition in a recent interview with the times one of the russian officials named in the memo as having met with mr cohen oleg solodukhin denied that he had met with mr cohen or any other trump representative i don t know where that rumor came from mr solodukhin of the russian organization rossotrudnichestvo which promotes russian culture and interests abroad said in a telephone interview the times reported before the election that the f b i was looking into possible evidence of links between the trump campaign and russia but the investigation surfaced again at a senate hearing on tuesday in a series of questions from senator ron wyden democrat of oregon to the f b i director james b comey mr wyden trying to draw mr comey out on information he may have heard during a classified briefing asked if the f b i had investigated the trump campaign s contacts with russia mr comey demurred saying he could not discuss any investigations that might or might not be underway mr wyden kept pressing asking mr comey to provide a written answer to the question before mr trump s inauguration on jan 20 because he feared there would be no declassification of the information once mr trump took office after the hearing mr wyden posted on twitter the f b i obtained the material long before the election and some of the memos in the opposition research dossier are dated as early as june but agents have struggled to confirm it according to federal officials familiar with the investigation allies of senator harry reid the senate democratic leader from nevada who retired at the end of the year said the disclosures validated his call last summer for an investigation by the f b i into mr trump s links to russia democrats on tuesday night pressed for a thorough investigation of the claims in the memos representative eric swalwell of california a member of the house intelligence committee called for law enforcement to find out whether the russian government had had any contact with mr trump or his campaign the has spoken a number of times including after being presented with this evidence in flattering ways about russia and its dictator mr swalwell said considering the evidence of russia hacking our democracy to his benefit the would do a service to his presidency and our country by

president vulnerable to suspicions of corruption the unusual public criticism from walter m shaub jr director of the office of government ethics followed mr trump s most detailed explanation yet of his plans to distance himself from the global business operations of the trump organization no modern president has entered the white house with such a complicated array of holdings the steps mr trump outlined include turning over to the united states treasury any profits received at his hotels from foreign government clients an ethics officer and separately a chief compliance counsel will be

president trump can t unknow he owns trump tower and the press will make sure that any new developments at the trump organization are well publicized in addition she said the price of a sale of assets would draw scrutiny and mr trump would still be owed royalties the speaking at a news conference wednesday in trump tower repeated his view expressed shortly after his election that as president he will be exempt from conflict of interest laws that apply to all other federal employees except the vice president but he and his legal team said he would still take voluntary steps to avoid even a perception of a conflict such as the appearance that a decision he made as president might benefit one of his business ventures but mr trump and his advisers would not release basic information about this plan mr trump has filed information with the federal government that indicates he is worth at least 1 5 billion but that information has not been independently verified and the value of the assets being transferred into the trust is not known mr trump s representatives also would not release the names of people who stand to benefit from any profits the trust generates or say whether mr trump would be able to reverse the transaction on wednesday mr trump rebuffed a renewed call to release his tax returns which presidents have done for decades and which would show how much profit he makes from his business endeavors including golf courses marketing deals and commercial office space mr shaub who was appointed by president obama said that he did not believe selling assets was too high a price to pay to be president and that mr trump must divest them in order to avoid conflicts of interest we can t risk creating the perception that government leaders would use their official positions for profit said mr shaub whose office establishes ethical standards for 2 7 million civilian employees in the white house and more than 130 executive branch agencies i appreciate that divestiture can be costly but the would not be alone in making that sacrifice he criticized mr trump s decision to put his assets into a trust instead of under the far stricter control of an independent manager known as a blind trust the only thing this has in common with a blind trust is the label trust mr shaub said during an unusual news conference wednesday at the brookings institution a policy research center in washington his sons are still running the businesses and of course he knows what he owns even some republican ethics experts questioned how far mr trump had gone to confront the many ethical issues he faces they noted for example that mr trump had not promised to prohibit communication between federal employees and anyone at the trump organization or his current or future business partners if you don t have a real firewall outsiders will view doing business with the trump organization as a way to gain access to the administration or to influence it said matthew t sanderson a washington lawyer who worked on the republican presidential campaigns of john mccain rand paul and rick perry in fact mr trump and his legal advisers seemed on wednesday to revise a promise that the had made on twitter in december that there would be no new deals by his company while he was in the white house now his legal team said this standard will apply only to foreign deals ms dillon said the trump organization had canceled about 30 pending deals costing it millions of dollars but the company will continue to look for new business opportunities be it hotels golf courses or other ventures within the united states at a time when the trump organization brand has an unrivaled profile instead the trump enterprise will clear new transactions with an ethics adviser to be named by the in the coming days that person will vet the deals for potential conflicts using a standard that mr trump s advisers said had not yet been determined a spokeswoman for mr trump said he had always intended the no new deals promise to apply only to foreign deals the influence mr trump will have over foreign and domestic policy as president has raised questions about whether american policy could affect his bottom line for instance he will oversee the regulation of banks some of which lend money to his company and he will have frequent contact with foreign heads of state including some who run countries where the trump organization does business he has consistently used his position to showcase his real estate properties inviting dignitaries and cabinet hopefuls to visit him at his golf club in westchester county n y and his resort in palm beach fla and the business offers have been flowing in mr trump says his lawyers said his company had canceled 30 deals as he prepares to take office and last weekend mr trump said he had turned down a 2 billion deal in dubai i don t want to take advantage of something mr trump said the dubai offer came from damac a major developer in the persian gulf region that is building the trump international golf club dubai and an adjacent luxury housing development mr trump and his legal team appeared to be particularly sensitive to the suggestion that mr trump might violate the emoluments clause of the constitution which prohibits federal employees from taking any present emolument office or title of any kind whatever from any king prince or foreign state ms dillon the trump organization lawyer who works for the washington firm morgan lewis said the clause in her view did not apply to transactions such as a foreign government s paying a hotel bill but to address the issue the organization plans to donate to the federal government the profits derived from any payments from foreign governments to hotels it owns representatives of the organization did not reply when asked how this calculation would be made or whether a public accounting of the payments would be provided but trump organization officials said this agreement would not apply to golf courses or other businesses that means mr trump could still benefit from payments by foreign governments critics said erwin chemerinsky dean of the university of california irvine school of law also said the plan to turn over profits from foreign government payments to mr trump s hotels was not sufficient to eliminate the constitutional issue as soon as he receives the payment he will have benefited even if he later decides to give it away mr chemerinsky said this will mean he will have violated a provision of the constitution separately mr trump s daughter ivanka said on her facebook page that she was both separating herself from the trump organization and turning over management of her brand of handbags jewelry shoes and other accessories to another executive but ethics experts said the family might have figured out a way to accelerate the growth of their business while taking modest steps to separate themselves from the operations it s hard to imagine anything she could do to help the brand more than simply being a part of the white house apparatus robert weissman president of public citizen a liberal nonprofit said of ivanka trump the only solution for all of this is for them to divest and that does not include handing it to another family member ',\n",
       " 'he deemed buzzfeed news a failing pile of garbage mocked an inquiry about his tax returns gee i ve never heard that one before and in an moment for a presidential news conference shouted down questions from a cnn reporter declaring with some menace not you your organization is terrible said donald j trump his voice rising as jim acosta of cnn tried to interject no i m not going to give you a question i m not going to give you a question you the said as mr acosta and other stunned journalists looked on are fake news any hope that mr trump would temper his attacks on the news media after the campaign seemed to dissipate in the marble atrium of trump tower on wednesday as the holding his first news conference since july turned a controversy over his ties to russia into a deft and unrelenting attack on the journalists who reported it it was a spectacle that attracted nearly 300 reporters to midtown manhattan the news conference was carried live in australia england and germany and it came against an extraordinary backdrop reports that intelligence officials had briefed mr trump on a document alleging collusion between the russian government and his campaign cnn broke the news on tuesday but declined to publish specific allegations saying its reporters could not verify them buzzfeed news published the unverified claims in full a move that prompted an ethical debate in journalistic circles and offered mr trump an opening the fact that buzzfeed and cnn made the decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim is a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks the incoming white house press secretary sean spicer said inaccurately lumping the two news organizations together but the result was classic trump not only did he break the norms of presidential engagement with the news media snubbing organizations because of an unflattering story but he also had elements of a frustrated political press corps warring with one another immediately after the news conference cnn defended its reporting and drew a sharp distinction between its news story and buzzfeed s decision to publish unsubstantiated memos on a broadcast the cnn anchor jake tapper said that buzzfeed s move hurts us all it s irresponsible to put uncorroborated information on the internet mr tapper said i can understand why trump would be upset about that i would be upset about it too later chuck todd the nbc news moderator repeatedly pressed buzzfeed s editor in chief ben smith on why unverified claims did not amount to fake news mr smith for his part said he was not going to participate in an attempt to divide the media against each other in a memo on wednesday buzzfeed s chief executive jonah h peretti defended the move we are going to keep doing what we do best which is deliver impactful journalism he wrote still by the time the news conference finished with omarosa manigault the apprentice star and future member of the white house staff heckling mr acosta shouting cut it out mr trump had bobbed and weaved his way through nearly an hour of interrogation offering vague answers to critical questions about his administration yet the conduct of the news media a familiar foil from mr trump s campaign days remained at the center of the day s story the treatment of mr acosta raised alarms among news media advocates and his fellow journalists particularly after mr acosta described a threat by mr spicer to eject him from the news conference when he persisted in trying to ask the a question harsh words between reporters and press secretaries happen but an anchor for a rival network shepard smith of fox news later came to mr acosta s defense saying that no journalists should be subjected to belittling and delegitimizing by the of the united states the national press club also lamented mr trump s behavior saying in a statement presidents shouldn t get to pick and choose which reporters questions they will answer based on what news outlet for which they work mr trump who ultimately took one question from a cnn reporter also called on journalists from two organizations breitbartnews and one america news matthew boyle the breitbart reporter asked the for his ideas on how to reform the news media mostly however mr trump took questions from journalists at the major television networks with john roberts of fox news going first a greek chorus of sorts mostly trump supporters and aides including ms manigault watched from the side applauding mr trump and jeering questions from reporters they deemed unpleasant a man who prides himself on finding an opponent s weakness mr trump at one point zeroed in on an existential question that has lingered in many newsrooms since his surprise victory how much does the traditional news media still matter in a polarized age when hallie jackson an nbc news correspondent asked the if he would finally release his tax returns to verify his claim that he has no financial dealings in russia mr trump scoffed you know the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters o k the said they re the only ones who ask you don t think the american public is concerned about it ms jackson asked i don t

       " 'washington the good news for representative mike pompeo of kansas donald j trump s nominee to run the central intelligence agency is that he appears to share the same adversarial view of russia as most american spies the bad news for mr pompeo is that he will have to square his views with those of mr trump who has denigrated american intelligence agencies praised president vladimir v putin of russia and is now contending with a dossier of unsubstantiated reports that russia has collected compromising and salacious personal information about him known as a pugnacious republican partisan by his colleagues in congress mr pompeo is going to have pull off the political balancing act of his career to keep the confidence of the trump white house while winning over the c i a an agency that is notoriously hostile to outsiders in the best of times his senate confirmation hearing scheduled for thursday before the senate intelligence committee will be the first test of whether he has the diplomatic finesse to manage it mr trump s aides will no doubt be keeping close watch for any signs that they cannot rely on mr pompeo while democrats on the committee will be eager to look for any daylight between the nominee and mr trump that will be especially true when it comes to the assessment by intelligence agencies that russia used cyberattacks and disinformation to undermine american democracy and promote the candidacy of mr trump at the c i a the concerns are more parochial the message officials will be looking to hear from mr pompeo is i m going to protect you from these guys said michael v hayden a former director of both the c i a and the national security agency every television set in langley is going to be on for that hearing mr hayden said referring to the town in northern virginia where the c i a is based mr trump s mocking response to accusations that russia meddled in the election has opened an extraordinary breach between an incoming president and the c i a and the revelation that intelligence chiefs briefed mr trump last week on the dossier of unsubstantiated reports is likely to deepen the divide the dispute has hit morale hard at the c i a current and former agency officials said at his news conference on wednesday mr trump said that intelligence agencies were vital and that they would have 90 days after his inauguration to produce a major report on hacking but he also continued to criticize the agencies suggesting that they had leaked the dossier it was disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out he said the c i a considers its mission to provide cleareyed information and analysis that is free of political interference and it considers the president its main customer it is sensitive to slights and many at the c i a were especially galled by what they considered mr trump s cheap shots at the mistaken intelligence in the prelude to the iraq war it prides itself on being the president s agency so how does that feel when your patron suddenly is dumping all over your work said mark m lowenthal a former c i a analyst memories run long at the c i a and hanging over the dispute with mr trump is the unhappy tenure of porter j goss the last sitting member of congress named to lead the agency mr goss took over in 2004 when the agency was widely viewed as being at odds with the bush administration over the iraq war and his marching orders were to end what the white house viewed as a campaign of leaks by insiders who opposed administration policies mr goss failed to stop the leaks but his attempted crackdown which included rare polygraph tests of senior officials prompted a wave of departures by veterans mr goss lasted only 13 months done in by the spreading discontent with his leadership mr pompeo has not made any public comments since his nomination in november and how he will approach his new job remains to be seen he is best known for his relentless questioning of hillary clinton during the congressional investigation into the 2012 attacks on the american consulate in benghazi libya his quips about the attack being worse than watergate and his continued insistence that there was a even after the house select committee on benghazi found no new evidence of wrongdoing have raised some concerns about such an overt partisan leading an agency that is supposed to be above politics but among both democrats and republicans in congress mr pompeo a former army tank officer who graduated first in his class from west point is widely seen as smart and thorough and a professional who is capable of rising above the political fray he really enjoys this type of work so i think he s going to flourish said representative devin nunes a republican from california he s a military guy an academy graduate and this is what he s been working for his whole career at the c i a there was a sense that mr pompeo s nomination signaled an end to mr trump s dismissals of accusations about russian meddling and a readiness to start taking intelligence seriously a new administration often brings an infusion of energy and ideas and most at the agency are eager to get to work under mr pompeo according to a current c i a official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they could not be quoted by name but there are already suggestions from some corners of the trump camp about a need to reorganize the intelligence community which has stoked concerns at the c i a of a hostile takeover by leaders who want political cheerleading not cleareyed analysis mr lowenthal said how mr pompeo gets along with lt gen michael t flynn mr trump s choice for national security adviser is likely to prove crucial mr flynn a retired intelligence officer and a former director of the defense intelligence agency is a harsh judge of the c i a which he says was overly politicized by the obama administration that view is not widely shared by republicans or democrats in washington but it appears to have been internalized by mr trump still mr pompeo s hawkish views on a range of other issues are likely to be welcomed at the agency he has argued for congress to permit domestic surveillance on a huge scale says waterboarding is legal and does not constitute torture and views russia as the biggest threat facing the united states i think it s safe to say that mr pompeo is very skeptical of vladimir putin mr nunes said i don t think you can get any more concerned about putin s advancement than mr pompeo democrats expect to hit the russia issue hard in an attempt to draw out differences between mr pompeo and mr trump but they are also looking for mr pompeo to take clear stances on controversial issues where he has made statements that put him in line with the like waterboarding and domestic surveillance senator ron wyden democrat of oregon said he expected mr pompeo to try to avoid being pinned down especially on matters on which he may disagree with mr trump by saying that the director of the c i a does not set policy but only executes it mr pompeo took that tack in his written responses to questions from some senators on the intelligence committee senator wyden said i m going to be respectfully saying that s a lot of baloney he added as director of the c i a mr pompeo would have an enormous effect on surveillance and torture and russia senator wyden said the american people want policies that are going to better produce security and liberty the trump team is advancing ideas that give us less of

       " 'washington federal prosecutors announced criminal charges on wednesday against six volkswagen executives for their roles in the company s scandal a sharp turn by a departing administration that is trying to remake its image of being soft on corporate crime the six executives include a former head of development of the volkswagen brand and the head of engine development one of those charged on wednesday oliver schmidt was arrested in florida last week the other five are believed to be in germany volkswagen also formally pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to violate the clean air act customs violations and obstruction of justice many of the 600 000 cars in the united states equipped with software were imported from germany or mexico the automaker is set to pay 4 3 billion in criminal and civil penalties in connection with the federal investigation bringing the total cost of the deception to volkswagen in the united states including settlements of suits by car owners to 20 billion one of the costliest corporate scandals in history volkswagen knew of these problems attorney general loretta e lynch said at a news conference in washington when regulators expressed concerns volkswagen obfuscated she said and they ultimately lied extracting a guilty plea from a major corporation is a notable feat for an administration that has been accused of allowing companies to buy themselves out of indictments through deferred prosecution deals the move comes as outgoing members of the obama administration race to finish major cases before leaving their jobs the volkswagen case is also the first major test of a justice department commitment to hold executives more accountable even as the agency braces for big changes in its top ranks under donald j trump the justice department has been criticized for years as being too easy on the banks that caused the financial meltdown and set off a major recession though financial institutions paid large fines and settled civil cases executives mostly avoided personal liability and large companies have rarely faced criminal charges a policy that some critics have derisively labeled too big to jail moving to address that criticism deputy attorney general sally q yates issued a new policy in september 2015 telling prosecutors to focus from the start of their investigations on prosecuting company officials found to have engaged in wrongdoing too often ms yates said the justice department began with a corporate investigation negotiated a civil settlement and only at the end of an inquiry asked whether any individuals should be prosecuted this isn t just a paper policy i think you re seeing the results ms yates said in a telephone interview on wednesday there s a shift in focus here that is across the board in the department and it s starting to bear fruit andrew mccabe the deputy director of the federal bureau of investigation underscored that point at the news conference with ms lynch this case is a great example of the fact that no corporation is too big no corporation is too global and no person is beyond the law he said the volkswagen employees charged on wednesday were neusser 56 who oversaw development of the company s brand jens hadler 50 who oversaw engine development richard dorenkamp 68 another supervisor of engine development bernd gottweis 69 who helped oversee quality management and jürgen peter 59 who was a liaison between regulatory agencies and the carmaker they and mr schmidt were charged with conspiracy to defraud the united states defraud customers and violate the clean air act it is unclear whether the five executives named on wednesday will ever appear in a united states court if they are in germany the country does not normally extradite its citizens even if germany does not extradite or prosecute them the charges in the united states would severely limit their ability to travel the case could also set up a diplomatic tussle between germany and the coming administration though mr trump s stance on the case is far from clear ms lynch said she could not speculate on whether germany would hand over the men still she said we ve always worked very well with our german colleagues regulators in the united states first began to investigate volkswagen early in 2014 after a study by west virginia university showed that its diesel cars polluted far more on the road than during official emissions tests company executives knew that the cars were programmed to recognize when they were being tested and to deliver optimum pollution readings according to investigators but rather than admit wrongdoing volkswagen representatives provided false and misleading information for more than a year to the california air resources board and the environmental protection agency mr schmidt was arrested on saturday at miami international airport as he was about to board a flight to germany in september a former volkswagen engineer who worked for the company in california james liang pleaded guilty to charges that included conspiracy to defraud the federal government and violating the clean air act none of the executives charged on wednesday were members of the volkswagen management board although several of them reported directly to the board the lack of accusations against any top managers could help insulate volkswagen from lawsuits by shareholders who have accused the company of failing to disclose the risks it faced several of those charged on wednesday played management roles in the development of the diesel engines that were equipped with defeat devices software intended to mask excess emissions by cranking up pollution controls whenever a car was being tested on rollers in a lab others have been accused

       " 'washington as he prepared last week to deliver his farewell address president obama convened three democratic leaders in the white house for a strategy session on the future of their party the quiet huddle included senator chuck schumer of new york and representative nancy pelosi of california the top democrats in congress and gov terry mcauliffe of virginia one topic of urgent concern according to people briefed on the meeting how to break the republican party s iron grip on the congressional map thwarted for much of his term by a confrontational republican congress and criticized by his fellow democrats for not devoting sufficient attention to their candidates mr obama has decided to make the byzantine process of legislative redistricting a central political priority in his first years after the presidency emerging as mr obama s chief collaborator and proxy is eric h holder jr the former attorney general of the united states and a personal friend of the president he has signed on to lead the national democratic redistricting committee a newly formed political group aimed at untangling the creatively drawn districts that have helped cement the republican party in power in washington and many state capitals in an interview this week at covington burling the washington law firm where he is now in private practice mr holder 65 said that he and mr obama believe republicans have undermined the political system by creating a patchwork of legislative maps at both the state and federal levels that are designed to stifle the will of voters echoing a number of mr obama s top advisers mr holder described fighting republican gerrymandering as a primary concern for the president once he leaves the white house he thinks and i think that this is something that threatens our democracy mr holder said we have a system now where the politicians are picking their voters as opposed to voters making selections about who they want to represent them mr holder is set to kick off his initiative on thursday with a speech at the center for american progress a liberal think tank in washington the first major event for the group is to take place in chicago this spring david jacobson a former ambassador to canada and an obama campaign is hosting the event mr holder said he anticipated that vice president joseph r biden jr would also be involved along with other present and former cabinet members for mr obama the redistricting campaign signals how personally engaged in electoral politics he intends to be after leaving office unlike many former presidents who enjoy something of a period mr obama has also appeared to concede in recent weeks that he spent a limited amount of time tending to the democratic party as an institution during his time in office and in a television interview explained almost apologetically that the presidency is a job but redistricting may be a special preoccupation among mr obama and his allies for them mr holder said there is considerable resentment of how an entrenched house republican majority undermined the president s goals over of his tenure the tasks that he had placed before him were made a lot more difficult progress a lot more difficult than it needed to be mr holder said of mr obama that s because of the congress that he had to deal with which was a function of the 2010 redistricting effort while mr holder said he committed to lead the new democratic group well before election day and spoke with hillary clinton about redistricting during the presidential race he said donald j trump s victory had intensified interest among activists and donors the and campaign comes amid a broader resurgence in democratic interest in state and local elections at a moment when republicans control every lever of government in washington candidates seeking to lead the democratic national committee have called for a more intensive focus on nonfederal elections and several senior democrats said distraught party donors were turning their attention to the states the democratic governors association and the democratic legislative campaign committee two groups teaming up with mr holder are already recruiting candidates for upcoming elections mr mcauliffe who declined to discuss the white house meeting said he had been in touch with ms pelosi and mr schumer since the elections to refocus the party s attention on races in the states he said he and ms pelosi had commiserated about the grim state of the congressional map i said nancy it doesn t matter how much money you have if we don t have lines where democrats can run competitively and win mr mcauliffe said but democrats have long suffered from a consuming obsession with the presidency at the expense of other elections said mr mcauliffe a former national party chairman we ve got to be smarter about how we re building the future of this party we have been decimated at the state level and it s at the state level that they draw the maps he said adding we raise all this money in the presidential and then everybody goes away the next round of congressional redistricting is still years away after the next decennial census in 2020 but the officials drawing the maps in most states will be chosen in elections well before then starting with the election for governor in virginia this year democrats ruefully acknowledge now that before the 2010 census riding high after mr obama s 2008 victory and seemingly secure in their hold on congress they were far less prepared than republicans in gearing up for legislative reapportionment the republican party mounted a ferocious campaign that gave it overwhelming control of redistricting allowing it to lock in many victories in the 2010 midterm elections in the to 2020 democrats say their goal in many places will be not to seize control of redistricting but merely to capture one or two key offices to keep republicans from locking them out of the process right now there are 25 states in which republicans control the whole government the governorship and the legislature versus just six wholly controlled by democrats mr holder said his initiative would unfold on three fronts in court where democrats will challenge maps they see as violating the law on the campaign trail where they will seek to win offices that influence redistricting and through ballot referendums in states that allow voters to give direct approval to laws mandating new procedures for legislative apportionment mr holder said he was also prepared to take an unaccustomed leap into electoral politics campaigning for candidates around the country who can affect the redistricting process a career prosecutor mr holder has quickly emerged as a leading figure in democratic efforts to fight mr trump he has been retained by the california legislature to help in any battles with the trump administration the success of the new effort will depend in part on whether the newfound appetite among democrats for confronting gerrymandering can be sustained as more attention turns to what will be a presidential primary the sort of glamorous campaign that often attracts the most attention from liberal donors at the expense of party building efforts republican donors have typically been more attentive to state elections they are expected to pour money into defending the party s hold on power outside of washington party strategists hope that having as a figure as mr holder and eventually mr obama himself will make it easier for them to solicit and figure checks mr holder said he and mr obama believed strongly that democrats needed to look beyond washington i can remember conversations with him where it was his view that it wouldn t take huge amounts of money to have an impact on state and local races mr holder said but that it would take a substantial amount of effort leading the legal offensive will be marc elias the prominent democratic election lawyer who has already won challenges to maps in several states including florida and virginia before 2010 mr elias said democrats had prepared for a conventional negotiation over drawing lines in legislatures and in court but had not matched the republican party s yearslong strategy for dominating elections fueled by heavily funded outside groups mr obama mr elias said would help direct the best and the brightest in the party to see this as really important for the moment at least democrats are portraying their campaign as a matter of fairness criticizing republicans for having mangled the maps in places like ohio and michigan so that solidly purple states are represented disproportionately by republicans democrats believe that where states have drawn maps by nonpartisan means or by court order it has tended to benefit them republicans have tended to roll their eyes at democratic complaints about redistricting given how aggressively some in mr obama s party drew maps in their favor when democrats had more power mr holder said he viewed republican gerrymandering as more extreme than anything democrats had engineered for their own benefit in blue states but he declined to say that democrats should eschew gerrymandering of their own yet in a sign of tensions that might later emerge mr holder suggested that some democratic incumbents might have to be willing to run in more competitive districts to avoid clustering core democratic constituencies in a tiny number of districts some senior black lawmakers have resisted efforts to overhaul the map in ways that would make their districts even modestly whiter and more competitive democrats see mr obama and mr holder as potentially persuasive messengers in easing such resistance and mr holder said bluntly that black lawmakers could also win seats that are not necessarily incumbents of both parties he said should get more comfortable with the notion that with fairly drawn districts elections might be more significantly contested he added that s a good thing for our democracy ',\n",
       " 'hong kong taiwan scrambled fighter jets and dispatched a frigate to the taiwan strait on wednesday after china sent its sole aircraft carrier into the waterway taiwan s official central news agency reported the transit of the aircraft carrier the liaoning came amid rising tensions between taiwan and china after donald j trump broke decades of protocol by speaking on the phone with taiwan s president tsai after his election victory ms tsai leads a political party that has traditionally supported taiwan s formal independence from china ms tsai who is visiting central america this week made two calls to officials in taiwan seeking updates on the liaoning s transit the central news agency reported citing alex huang the president s spokesman china s decision to send the carrier through the waterway that separates it from taiwan reflects an early foreign policy challenge for mr trump it s a show of force and i think it is intended in part to intimidate and that s worrisome from the u s and taiwan s point of view because we don t know how much more they are going to ratchet up these pressures and tensions said bonnie s glaser senior adviser for asia at the center for strategic and international studies in washington if the trump administration does see this as a test of u s resolve i suspect they ll push back pretty forcefully china sent the carrier which had been conducting exercises in the south china sea into the taiwan strait on wednesday morning taiwan s response was the third time in three days that air forces in the region had scrambled jets in response to chinese military activity after japan and south korea deployed fighters on monday those actions occurred when a squadron of six chinese bombers and two other aircraft flew over the waters that separate japan and south korea and over the sea of japan taiwan considered by beijing to be chinese territory has been governed separately since 1949 when the forces of the nationalist leader chiang fled to the island after their defeat on the mainland by the communists china views any assertion of taiwan s separateness from the mainland like ms tsai s call with mr trump as an affront to its claim of sovereignty since 1979 the united states has recognized the government in beijing and broke off formal diplomatic ties to taiwan as part of the one china policy in the wake of the call china warned the incoming president against making changes to that policy after he takes office on jan 20 liu zhenmin a chinese vice foreign minister said on wednesday that the taiwan strait was an international waterway and that it was normal for the liaoning to pass though it the passage would not have any effect on relations he said in remarks carried in the chinese news media mark c toner a state department spokesman told reporters in washington in response to a question about the liaoning s passage through the strait that the united states wouldn t have a problem with countries sailing their vessels in international waters as long as it was done in accordance with international law it also was not the first time the liaoning had sailed through the strait it passed through in november 2013 on its way to the south china sea after having been commissioned only the year before in that instance the carrier kept to the western half of the strait closer to mainland china in a statement on wednesday morning taiwan s defense ministry said that the liaoning was also staying to the west of the strait s middle and urged citizens to remain calm a transit on the eastern side closer to taiwan would be viewed as much more provocative euan graham the director of the international security program at the lowy institute in sydney australia said that for the chinese traveling through the strait was a logical way to move from one area of fleet operations to another along its long coastline in order for warships based in northern ports like the liaoning to return home from southern waters they must either pass close to japanese islands or transit the taiwan strait geography forces a very binary choice he said mr graham said it was important to see how the liaoning conducted its passage if it had aircraft on deck and was conducting flight operations that would be seen as more provocative than if it passed through the strait with the aircraft in its hangar bay he said the liaoning commissioned in 2012 and built from a soviet hull is china s first aircraft carrier in past decades the united states has shown its resolve to defend taiwan by sailing carriers through the taiwan strait in 1995 the aircraft carrier nimitz transited the strait amid heightened tensions after beijing conducted missile exercises in the waters china s military is highly secretive but it would seem inconceivable for the liaoning to pass through such contested waters without approval from the president xi jinping who is also the chairman of the central military commission which controls the military and the chinese military media has described the aircraft carrier as embodying mr xi s plans for a stronger navy capable of projecting force far beyond china s territorial waters last thursday the front page of people s liberation army daily the official newspaper of the chinese military featured a report about the aircraft carrier s latest journey under the headline we re sailing under the leader s attentive gaze a clear tribute to mr xi ma xiaoguang a spokesman for the taiwan affairs office in beijing said in a news conference on wednesday that the liaoning s passage was part of the ship s scheduled training in the western pacific which had begun on dec 24 mr ma also said that the relationship in the coming year would face increasing uncertainty looming risks and challenges he added that taiwan s government and independence forces there had seriously threatened the peace and stability of the taiwan strait accusing them of engaging in separatist activities and warning that china would resolutely safeguard its national sovereignty and territorial integrity the aircraft carrier s passage was part of a cluster of recent acts by the chinese military that have raised hackles in the region last month a chinese warship seized an underwater drone belonging to the united states navy about 50 miles northwest of subic bay in the philippines the drone was returned after the obama administration publicly chided china over the seizure on monday japan said it had sent fighter jets into the air after chinese bombers and surveillance planes flew over the east china sea and the sea of japan when china was militarily weaker japan considered that area to be its backyard said ni lexiong a naval affairs researcher at the shanghai university of political science and law this was a way of telling japan that if there ever is conflict the location of any future battle space won t be decided by you and america we have the initiative so japan don t think of meddling further afield in taiwan or the south china sea ',\n",
       " 'president xi jinping of china plans to stride into the snowy conclave of the world s financial elite next week attending the world economic forum at davos switzerland the first time a top chinese leader will put himself into the mix of political leaders and business executives who view themselves as the masters of the global economy his participation was announced by the chinese foreign ministry on tuesday it is the latest and in some ways the boldest chinese attempt to compete with the united states dominant position in world economic and strategic institutions a campaign that has been carried out everywhere from the conference rooms of asian central banks to the waters of the south china sea to the halls of the united nations in new york but it is unclear whether mr xi who rarely ventures beyond platitudes in discussing the strategies of the world s second largest economy can take advantage of this time of transition when the rest of the world is gauging whether the united states is pulling back from global leadership mr xi may sense an opening during a historic inflection point he plans to deliver a speech at davos at a moment when the incoming united states president donald j trump has suggested that the united states should withdraw from the traditional superpower role it has played since world war ii including its leadership of a global free trade agenda in recent years davos had come to embody that agenda a gathering at an alpine ski resort of some of the world s most powerful figures in the realms of politics media and technology discussions each year have been set by western leaders not asian ones but events of the past year brought into sharp focus a rise in populist denunciations of globalization free trade and inequality in some western nations including the united states with davos frequently mentioned by critics as a symbol of the root causes of their countries ailments china has benefited greatly from access to international trade markets since its entry in 2001 into the world trade organization and it could now become the most vocal proponent of that system mr trump campaigned on opposition to the existing global trade system and has denounced china for competing unfairly against the united states at davos mr xi plans to lead a delegation of senior officials china s wealthiest entrepreneurs and top executives of enterprises including the china poly group corporation which has ties to the chinese military people s daily the official communist party newspaper published an article wednesday that said china could become the torchbearer of the open trade system and boasted that mr xi s visit will boost the world s confidence in global governance his appearance is a logical step in his country s evolution into a superpower a rapid transformation that has been marked by bold symbolic gestures and events in the past decade including the 2008 summer olympics in beijing under president hu jintao mr xi s predecessor mr xi has carried on that theme with much more aggressive actions including overseeing construction of military infrastructure in the south china sea s contested waters and establishing a regional lending bank opposed by the united states premiers of china including the current one li keqiang have attended davos before but the nation s president and head of the communist party has never been to the gathering clearly it signals that xi jinping is now interested in writing both china and himself in a grander way on the global diplomatic horizon said orville schell director of the center on u s relations at the asia society he feels it s time to really come out behind that probably is an assumption and wishful thinking that the u s is in disarray europe is feckless and so on he ll be received almost as the number one citizen at davos mr schell added mr xi plans to attend davos on jan 17 during a state visit to switzerland from jan 15 to 18 said lu kang a foreign ministry spokesman at a regularly scheduled news conference in beijing on tuesday mr xi is expected to speak at the opening session of the forum which runs from jan 17 to 20 strong sentiments erupted last year in the movement in britain that culminated in the popular vote by british citizens to leave the european union but it was mr trump s election in november that was the apotheosis of the move in the west toward isolationism and meetings and conversations at davos whose theme this year is responsive and responsible leadership will take place in the shadow of mr trump s campaign promises and rhetoric it s going to be very tempting for china to imagine for itself that it s gained much more status after this election in a whole array of global endeavors including trade and on climate change and possibly other issues mr schell said if the u s is going to absent itself more and we don t know if that s the case yet nature does abhor a vacuum when a father grows old the son is sometimes able to fill the space victor shih a scholar of china s political economy at the university of california san diego said there are actually some global agenda matters on which china s influence might have peaked in the medium term he pointed to china s push in recent years to have the renminbi counted as an international currency that has been undermined in the past year by efforts of the chinese central bank the people s bank of china to withdraw large quantities of offshore renminbi from circulation the bank has been doing that in order to try to prop up the value of the renminbi and limit capital flight from china including the transfer of money to hong kong by wealthy chinese the people s bank of china continues to claim that renminbi internationalization is important and of course at davos president xi may continue to pay verbal homage to that agenda because it would be an important sign of china s ascendance on the world stage mr shih said yet in the past year we have seen renminbi deposits outside of mainland china decline by hundreds of billions of renminbi among the chinese tycoons expected to attend davos are wang jianlin founder of the wanda group a property and cinema company and jack ma founder of the alibaba group china s biggest company they are commonly referred to as the two wealthiest men in china both are investing in the united states and mr ma met with mr trump on monday at trump tower in new york to discuss business opportunities between companies in the two countries within mr trump s family his jared kushner has been involved in personal business negotiations with top chinese executives some members of the congress mostly republicans have called for greater scrutiny of chinese investments in the united states

afghanistan 1400 youth political movement starting public campaigns to console victims of violence around the country and to raise support for afghan governance these efforts have two impacts one is we stand up against things we believe are wrong but the other more important factor is we project courage he told the guardian newspaper a few years ago as he was spearheading an effort to clean up and reopen a lakeside picnic spot in kabul after a taliban attack we enable people to stand up against violence people who in many ways have been passive because of fears instilled among the

plausibly derive from iranian stockpiles for years iran has been under a series of international sanctions prohibiting it from exporting arms the united states has frequently claimed that tehran has violated the sanctions in support of proxy forces in many conflicts including in iraq syria yemen and the palestinian territories the grenade launchers that were the subject of mr schroeder s analysis are the central component of a reusable weapon system commonly called they were among 81 launchers seized on the samer by australian sailors part of a hidden cargo that included 1 968 kalashnikov assault rifles 49 pk machine guns 41 spare barrels and 20 mortar tubes enough weapons to arm a potent ground force although the evidence was not conclusive mr schroeder said the seizure appears to be yet another example of iranian weapons being shipped abroad despite longstanding u n restrictions on arms transfers from iran with iran observing three days of mourning following the death of ayatollah ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani it was not possible to contact the government for comment but on previous occasions iran has refused to respond to inquiries about the smuggling the samer episode was one of four interdictions of iranian dhows from september 2015 through march 2016 that yielded in total more than 80 antitank guided missiles and 5 000 kalashnikov rifles as well as sniper rifles machine guns and almost 300 rpg launchers according to data provided by the united states navy in 2013 the navy stopped another dhow off the yemeni coast and found it to be carrying antiaircraft missiles and launchers rifle and cartridges c4 plastic explosives equipment and other military items in an interview in bahrain vice adm kevin m donegan the commander of the navy s fifth fleet suggested that these seizures were part of a larger effort by iran to move weapons to the houthis absolutely it s not everything he said of the four seizures in 2015 and 2016 these are the ones that i know of because we were able to interdict them admiral donegan noted however that the captains operating the vessels are typically fishermen smugglers they re not necessarily working for the government of iran he added that the evidence of iran s hand in the shipments while strong was not ironclad this echoed the report by conflict armament research which said that antitank weapons apparently seized in yemen have matched lot numbers for the same class of weapons seized on iranian dhows but stopped short of claiming to have clear proof of an iranian government hand the consultancy also documented weapons manufactured by china russia romania bulgaria and perhaps in north korea in seizures from the dhows the consultancy also did not suggest that the evidence indicated a direct handoff of weapons from the dhows to houthi forces rather it said the weapons appear to be offloaded in somalia and transferred to smaller vessels for smuggling into southern yemen weapons from iranian dhows would not be alone in reaching the conflict which has been fueled in part by extensive arms transfers by outside governments western governments including those of the united states britain and canada have provided billions of dollars worth of weapons and military equipment as well as intelligence and logistics support to the coalition which has been waging an extensive bombing campaign against the houthis among the weapons have been guided bombs and cluster munitions both of which have been linked by human rights groups and journalists to attacks on yemeni factories and civilian deaths ',\n",
       " 'president obama delivered his farewell address in chicago on tuesday the following is the complete transcript as provided by the federal news service obama hello chicago applause it s good to be home applause thank you everybody applause thank you applause thank you applause thank you so much thank you thank you thank you applause it s good to be home thank you applause we re on live tv here i ve got to move applause you can tell that i m a lame duck because nobody is following instructions laughter everybody have a seat my fellow americans michelle and i have been so touched by all the that we ve received over the past few weeks but tonight it s my turn to say thanks whether we have seen or rarely agreed at all my conversations with you the american people in living rooms and in schools at farms and on factory floors at diners and on distant military outposts those conversations are what have kept me honest and kept me inspired and kept me going and every day i have learned from you you made me a better president and you made me a better man so i first came to chicago when i was in my early twenties and i was still trying to figure out who i was still searching for a purpose to my life and it was a neighborhood not far from here where i began working with church groups in the shadows of closed steel mills it was on these streets where i witnessed the power of faith and the quiet dignity of working people in the face of struggle and loss crowd chanting four more years i can t do that now this is where i learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved and they get engaged and they come together to demand it after eight years as your president i still believe that and it s not just my belief it s the beating heart of our american idea our bold experiment in it s the conviction that we are all created equal endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights among them life liberty and the pursuit of happiness it s the insistence that these rights while have never been that we the people through the instrument of our democracy can form a more perfect union what a radical idea the great gift that our founders gave to us the freedom to chase our individual dreams through our sweat and toil and imagination and the imperative to strive together as well to achieve a common good a greater good for 240 years our nation s call to citizenship has given work and purpose to each new generation it s what led patriots to choose republic over tyranny pioneers to trek west slaves to brave that makeshift railroad to freedom it s what pulled immigrants and refugees across oceans and the rio grande it s what pushed women to reach for the ballot it s what powered workers to organize it s why gis gave their lives at omaha beach and iwo jima iraq and afghanistan and why men and women from selma to stonewall were prepared to give theirs as well applause so that s what we mean when we say america is exceptional not that our nation has been flawless from the start but that we have shown the capacity to change and make life better for those who follow yes our progress has been uneven the work of democracy has always been hard it has been contentious sometimes it has been bloody for every two steps forward it often feels we take one step back but the long sweep of america has been defined by forward motion a constant widening of our founding creed to embrace all and not just some applause if i had told you eight years ago that america would reverse a great recession reboot our auto industry and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history if i had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the cuban people shut down iran s nuclear weapons program without firing a shot take out the mastermind of if i had told you that we would win marriage equality and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizens if i had told you all that you might have said our sights were set a little too high but that s what we did that s what you did you were the change the answer to people s hopes and because of you by almost every measure america is a better stronger place than it was when we started in 10 days the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy no no no no no the peaceful transfer of power from one president to the next i committed to trump that my administration would ensure the smoothest possible transition just as president bush did for me because it s up to all of us to make sure our government can help us meet the many challenges we still face we have what we need to do so we have everything we need to meet those challenges after all we remain the wealthiest most powerful and most respected nation on earth our youth our drive our diversity and openness our boundless capacity for risk and reinvention means that the future should be ours but that potential will only be realized if our democracy works only if our politics better reflects the decency of our people only if all of us regardless of party affiliation or particular interests help restore the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right now and that s what i want to focus on tonight the state of our democracy understand democracy does not require uniformity our founders argued they quarreled and eventually they compromised they expected us to do the same but they knew that democracy does require a basic sense of solidarity the idea that for all our outward differences we re all in this together that we rise or fall as one there have been moments throughout our history that threatened that solidarity and the beginning of this century has been one of those times a shrinking world growing inequality demographic change and the specter of terrorism these forces haven t just tested our security and our prosperity but are testing our democracy as well and how we meet these challenges to our democracy will determine our ability to educate our kids and create good jobs and protect our homeland in other words it will determine our future to begin with our democracy won t work without a sense that everyone has economic opportunity applause and the good news is that today the economy is growing again wages incomes home values and retirement accounts are all rising again poverty is falling again applause the wealthy are paying a fair share of taxes even as the stock market shatters records the unemployment rate is near a low the uninsured rate has never ever been lower applause health care costs are rising at the slowest rate in 50 years and i ve said and i mean it anyone can put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements we ve made to our health care system that covers as many people at less cost i will publicly support it applause because that after all is why we serve not to score points or take credit but to make people s lives better applause but for all the real progress that we ve made we know it s not enough our economy doesn t work as well or grow as fast when a few prosper at the expense of a growing middle class and ladders for folks who want to get into the middle class applause that s the economic argument but stark inequality is also corrosive to our democratic idea while the top 1 percent has amassed a bigger share of wealth and income too many of our families in inner cities and in rural counties have been left behind the laid off factory worker the waitress or health care worker who s just barely getting by and struggling to pay the bills convinced that the game is fixed against them that their government only serves the interest of the powerful that s a recipe for more cynicism and polarization in our politics now there re no quick fixes to this trend i agree our trade should be fair and not just free but the next wave of economic dislocations won t come from overseas it will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes a lot of good middle class jobs obsolete and so we re going to have to forge a new social compact to guarantee all our kids the education they need applause to give workers the power applause to unionize for better wages cheers to update the social safety net to reflect the way we live now applause and make more reforms to the tax code so corporations and the individuals who reap the most from this new economy don t avoid their obligations to the country that s made their very success possible cheers applause we can argue about how to best achieve these goals but we can t be complacent about the goals themselves for if we don t create opportunity for all people the disaffection and division that has stalled our progress will only sharpen in years to come there s a second threat to our democracy and this one is as old as our nation itself after my election there was talk of a america and such a vision however well intended was never realistic race remains a potent applause and often divisive force in our society now i ve lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago no matter what some folks say applause you can see it not just in statistics you see it in the attitudes of young americans across the political spectrum but we re not where we need to be and all of us have more work to do applause if every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and an undeserving minority then workers of all shades are going to be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves applause if we re unwilling to invest in the children of immigrants just because they don t look like us we will diminish the prospects of our own children because those brown kids will represent a larger and larger share of america s workforce applause and we have shown that our economy doesn t have to be a game last year incomes rose for all races all age groups for men and for women so if we re going to be serious about race going forward we need to uphold laws against discrimination in hiring and in housing and in education and in the criminal justice system applause that is what our constitution and highest ideals require but laws alone won t be enough hearts must change it won t change overnight social attitudes oftentimes take generations to change but if our democracy is to work the way it should in this increasingly diverse nation then each one of us need to try to heed the advice of a great character in american fiction atticus finch who said you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view until you climb into his skin and walk around in it for blacks and other minority groups that means tying our own very real struggles for justice to the challenges that a lot of people in this country face not only the refugee or the immigrant or the rural poor or the transgender american but also the white guy who from the outside may seem like he s got all the advantages but has seen his world upended by economic and cultural and technological change we have to pay attention and listen applause for white americans it means acknowledging that the effects of slavery and jim crow didn t suddenly vanish in the 60s that when minority groups voice discontent they re not just engaging in reverse racism or practicing political correctness when they wage peaceful protest they re not demanding special treatment but the equal treatment that our founders promised applause for americans it means reminding ourselves that the stereotypes about immigrants today were said almost word for word about the irish and italians and poles who it was said were going to destroy the fundamental character of america and as it turned out america wasn t weakened by the presence of these newcomers these newcomers embraced this nation s creed and this nation was strengthened applause so regardless of the station we occupy we all have to try harder we all have to start with the premise that each of our fellow citizens loves this country just as much as we do that they value hard work and family just like we do that their children are just as curious and hopeful and worthy of love as our own applause cheering and that s not easy to do for too many of us it s become safer to retreat into our own bubbles whether in our neighborhoods or on college campuses or places of worship or especially our social media feeds surrounded by people who look like us and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions in the rise of naked partisanship and increasing economic and regional stratification the splintering of our media into a channel for every taste all this makes this great sorting seem natural even inevitable and increasingly we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information whether it s true or not that fits our opinions instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there applause and this trend represents a third threat to our democracy look politics is a battle of ideas that s how our democracy was designed in the course of a healthy debate we prioritize different goals and the different means of reaching them but without some common baseline of facts without a willingness to admit new information and concede that your opponent might be making a fair point and that science and reason matter then we re going to keep talking past each other crowd cheers and we ll make common ground and compromise impossible and isn t that part of what so often makes politics dispiriting how can elected officials rage about deficits when we propose to spend money on for kids but not when we re cutting taxes for corporations how do we excuse ethical lapses in our own party but pounce when the other party does the same thing it s not just dishonest it s selective sorting of the facts it s because as my mom used to tell me reality has a way of catching up with you take the challenge of climate change in just eight years we ve halved our dependence on foreign oil we ve doubled our renewable energy we ve led the world to an agreement that at the promise to save this planet applause but without bolder action our children won t have time to debate the existence of climate change they ll be busy dealing with its effects more environmental disasters more economic disruptions waves of climate refugees seeking sanctuary now we can and should argue about the best approach to solve the problem but to simply deny the problem not only betrays future generations it betrays the essential spirit of this country the essential spirit of innovation and practical that guided our founders crowd cheers it is that spirit it is that spirit born of the enlightenment that made us an economic powerhouse the spirit that took flight at kitty hawk and cape canaveral the spirit that cures disease and put a computer in every pocket it s that spirit a faith in reason and enterprise and the primacy of right over might that allowed us to resist the lure of fascism and tyranny during the great depression that allowed us to build a war ii order with other democracies an order based not just on military power or national affiliations but built on principles the rule of law human rights freedom of religion and speech and assembly and an independent press applause that order is now being challenged first by violent fanatics who claim to speak for islam more recently by autocrats in foreign capitals who seek free markets in open democracies and civil society itself as a threat to their power the peril each poses to our democracy is more far reaching than a car bomb or a missile they represent the fear of change the fear of people who look or speak or pray differently a contempt for the rule of law that holds leaders accountable an intolerance of dissent and free thought a belief that the sword or the gun or the bomb or the propaganda machine is the ultimate arbiter of what s true and what s right because of the extraordinary courage of our men and women in uniform because of our intelligence officers and law enforcement and diplomats who support our troops applause no foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland these past eight years cheers applause and although applause boston and orlando and san bernardino and fort hood remind us of how dangerous radicalization can be our law enforcement agencies are more effective and vigilant than ever we have taken out tens of thousands of terrorists including bin laden cheers applause the global coalition we re leading against isil has taken out their leaders and taken away about half their territory isil will be destroyed and no one who threatens america will ever be safe cheers applause and all who serve or have served it has been the honor of my lifetime to be your cheers and we all owe you a deep debt of gratitude cheers applause but protecting our way of life that s not just the job of our military democracy can buckle when it gives into fear so just as we as citizens must remain vigilant against external aggression we must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we are applause and that s why for the past eight years i ve worked to put the fight against terrorism on a firmer legal footing that s why we ve ended torture worked to close gitmo reformed our laws governing surveillance to protect privacy and civil liberties applause that s why i reject discrimination against muslim americans cheers who are just as patriotic as we are cheers applause that s why applause that s why we cannot withdraw applause that s why we cannot withdraw from big global fights to expand democracy and human rights and women s rights and lgbt rights applause no matter how imperfect our efforts no matter how expedient ignoring such values may seem that s part of defending america for the fight against extremism and intolerance and sectarianism and chauvinism are of a piece with the fight against authoritarianism and nationalist aggression if the scope of freedom and respect for the rule of law shrinks around the world the likelihood of war within and between nations increases and our own freedoms will eventually be threatened so let s be vigilant but not afraid isil will try to kill innocent people but they cannot defeat america unless we betray our constitution and our principles in the fight applause rivals like russia or china cannot match our influence around the world unless we give up what we stand for and turn ourselves into just another big country that bullies smaller neighbors which brings me to my final point our democracy is threatened whenever we take it for granted applause all of us regardless of party should be throwing ourselves into the task of rebuilding our democratic institutions applause when voting rates in america are some of the lowest among advanced democracies we should be making it easier not harder to vote applause when trust in our institutions is low we should reduce the corrosive influence of money in our politics and insist on the principles of transparency and ethics in public service when congress is dysfunctional we should draw our districts to encourage politicians to cater to common sense and not rigid extremes applause but remember none of this happens on its own all of this depends on our participation on each of us accepting the responsibility of citizenship regardless of which way the pendulum of power happens to be swinging our constitution is a remarkable beautiful gift but it s really just a piece of parchment it has no power on its own we the people give it power we the people give it meaning with our participation and with the choices that we make and the alliances that we forge whether or not we stand up for our freedoms whether or not we respect and enforce the rule of law that s up to us america is no fragile thing but the gains of our long journey to freedom are not assured in his own farewell address george washington wrote that is the underpinning of our safety prosperity and liberty but from different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth and so we have to preserve this truth with jealous anxiety that we should reject the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties that make us one applause america we weaken those ties when we allow our political dialogue to become so corrosive that people of good character aren t even willing to enter into public service so coarse with rancor that americans with whom we disagree are seen not just as misguided but as malevolent we weaken those ties when we define some of us as more american than others applause when we write off the whole system as inevitably corrupt and when we sit back and blame the leaders we elect without examining our own role in electing them crowd cheers it falls to each of us to be those anxious jealous guardians of our democracy embrace the joyous task we have been given to continually try to improve this great nation of ours because for all our outward differences we in fact all share the same proud type the most important office in a democracy citizen applause citizen so you see that s what our democracy demands it needs you not just when there s an election not just when you own narrow interest is at stake but over the full span of a lifetime if you re tired of arguing with strangers on the internet try talking with one of them in real life applause if something needs fixing then lace up your shoes and do some organizing crowd cheers if you re disappointed by your elected officials grab a clip board get some signatures and run for office yourself crowd cheers show up dive in stay at it sometimes you ll win sometimes you ll lose presuming a reservoir in goodness that can be a risk and there will be times when the process will disappoint you but for those of us fortunate enough to have been part of this one and to see it up close let me tell you it can energize and inspire and more often than not your faith in america and in americans will be confirmed mine sure has been applause over the course of these eight years i ve seen the hopeful faces of young graduates and our newest military officers i have mourned with grieving families searching for answers and found grace in a charleston church i ve seen our scientists help a paralyzed man regain his sense of touch i ve seen wounded warriors who at points were given up for dead walk again i ve seen our doctors and volunteers rebuild after earthquakes and stop pandemics in their tracks i ve seen the youngest of children remind us through their actions and through their generosity of our obligations to care for refugees or work for peace and above all to look out for each other so that faith that i placed all those years ago not far from here in the power of ordinary americans to bring about change that faith has been rewarded in ways i could not have possibly imagined and i hope your faith has too some of you here tonight or watching at home you were there with us in 2004 and 2008 2012 cheers applause maybe you still can t believe we pulled this whole thing off cheers let me tell you you re not the only ones laughter michelle cheers applause michelle lavaughn robinson of the south side cheers applause for the past 25 years you have not only been my wife and mother of my children you have been my best friend cheers applause you took on a role you didn t ask for and you made it your own with grace and with grit and with style and good humor cheers applause you made the white house a place that belongs to everybody cheers and a new generation sets its sights higher because it has you as a role model cheers applause you have made me proud and you have made the country proud cheers applause malia and sasha cheers under the strangest of circumstances you have become two amazing young women cheers you are smart and you are beautiful but more importantly you are kind and you are thoughtful and you are full of passion cheers applause and applause you wore the burden of years in the spotlight so easily of all that i have done in my life i am most proud to be your dad applause to joe biden cheers applause the scrappy kid from scranton cheers who became delaware s favorite son you were the first decision i made as a nominee and it was the best cheers applause not just because you have been a great vice president but because in the bargain i gained a brother and we love you and jill like family and your friendship has been one of the great joys of our lives applause to my remarkable staff for eight years and for some of you a whole lot more i have drawn from your energy and every day i try to reflect back what you displayed heart and character and idealism i ve watched you grow up get married have kids start incredible new journeys of your own even when times got tough and frustrating you never let washington get the better of you you guarded against cynicism and the only thing that makes me prouder than all the good that we ve done is the thought of all the amazing things that you are going to achieve from here applause and to all of you out there every organizer who moved to an unfamiliar town every kind family who welcomed them in every volunteer who knocked on doors every young person who cast a ballot for the first time every american who lived and breathed the hard work of change you are the best supporters and organizers anybody could ever hope for and i will forever be grateful because you did change the world applause you did and that s why i leave this stage tonight even more optimistic about this country than when we started because i know our work has not only helped so many americans it has inspired so many americans especially so many young people out there to believe that you can make a difference to hitch your wagon to something bigger than yourselves let me tell you this generation coming up unselfish altruistic creative patriotic i ve seen you in every corner of the country you believe in a fair and just and inclusive america you know that constant change has been america s hallmark that it s not something to fear but something to embrace you are willing to carry this hard work of democracy forward you ll soon outnumber any of us and i believe as a result the future is in good hands applause my fellow americans it has been the honor of my life to serve you i won t stop in fact i will be right there with you as a citizen for all my remaining days but for now whether you are young or whether you re young at heart i do have one final ask of you as your president the same thing i asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago i am asking you to believe not in my ability to bring about change but in yours i am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the moon a creed at the core of every american whose story is not yet written yes we can applause yes we did applause yes we can applause thank you god bless you and may god continue to bless the united states of america thank you applause end',\n",
       " 'it s the first year that united airlines will be offering basic economy fares the lowest prices on a particular flight but with notable restrictions such as you don t receive a seat assignment until and sitting next to your traveling companions is not guaranteed you re the last to board and you re not allowed to bring on a bag which means no use of the overhead bins on the list of things travelers care about overhead storage is second only to legroom according to interviews conducted in december by morning consult a media and technology company even so 45 percent of fliers said they would buy a basic economy fare and those travelers aren t necessarily strapped for cash some 39 percent of fliers earning 100 000 or more told morning consult that they were likely to purchase a basic economy ticket are there loopholes to get around those restrictive baggage and boarding rules will more major airlines begin restricting access to their overhead bin space and while we re talking about space which size will actually make it past the gate agent and onto the plane let s begin with united s new fares if you buy one of united s basic economy fares you can bring along a personal item like a laptop bag or backpack that is 9 inches by 10 inches by 17 inches or less but not luggage hence why you re not given access to the overhead bins but there are ways around those rules in fact there are three ways to bring on luggage and use the overhead bins even if you purchase a basic economy fare 1 if you re a premier member of the airline s mileageplus loyalty program 2 if you re the primary card member of a qualifying mileageplus credit card 3 if you re a star alliance gold member a frequent flier in the star alliance network of nearly 30 airlines any of the above will also prevent you from having to board last as well while united is the first major airline based in the united states to essentially start charging for its overhead bin space charging for bags is old hat on airlines frontier charges about 30 to 60 for a bag allegiant charges about 15 to 50 per bag spirit airlines and wizz air also charge for luggage there are ways to pay less though take frontier it charges for bags but the airline also offers packages like the works and the perks that include a bag as well as extras albeit they re givens on many major airlines such as seat selection and priority boarding remember too that it s generally cheaper to pay for your bag online rather than at the airport on frontier a bag costs up to 50 percent less if you pay online instead of at the ticket counter or the gate whether other major united states carriers join united and introduce new rules for their overhead bin space remains to be seen but it will not be surprising if they eventually do given that the airlines tend to copy one another if a new practice is successful indeed the latest segmentation of economy fares into seats and premium seats began with delta air lines and has since been adopted by american airlines and united if travelers take to united s basic economy fares expect the practice to become more widespread there is no universal bag size each airline has its own rules and baggage allowances may vary across routes and cabin classes in 2015 the international air transport association an industry group that represents about 260 airlines created guidelines for bags 21 5 x 13 5 x 7 5 inches but following a media hullabaloo the guidelines were not widely adopted major airlines american delta united jetblue airways cathay pacific have set their maximum size for economy passengers at 22 x 14 x 9 inches some airlines have stricter rules or slightly different measurements or a maximum of linear inches for example the maximum size for economy passengers on klm royal dutch airlines is 21 5 x 13 5 x 10 inches and qatar airways is 20 x 15 x 10 inches other airlines allow larger bags most likely to the dismay of the association of flight which has advocated for fewer and smaller bags to reduce risks of injury and conflict onboard the aircraft for instance british airways allows bags up to 22 x 18 x 10 inches southwest airlines allows bags up to 24 x 16 x 10 inches if you fly multiple airlines and want to travel the world with only one bag you ll want to buy one that s as small as possible soft bags that can squish into the overhead are easier to get on board if you are loyal to an airline with a generous baggage policy you can get away with a hard larger bag ryanair passengers who want to be assured that their bag will make it on board can buy one of the airline s approved bags sold on its website wheelies are 69 or 99 shopping for a new bag there are two things to keep in mind first an airline can change its policy so if you re buying a bigger bag you might not want to spend a mint for example beginning april 4 the maximum dimensions of the personal item travelers on spirit airlines are allowed to bring on board will be 18 x 14 x 8 inches a change from the current maximum size of 16 x 14 x 12 inches second consumer reports a nonprofit independent organization gives some good advice measure a bag before buying it why many bags sold as compliant are not necessarily so in 2015 consumer reports said it was made aware of this by customer reviews on amazon and ebags com that said that the bags they bought were larger than the manufacturers advertised to see just how common that was consumer reports bought 11 pieces of luggage from 11 brands that were marketed as luggage and then measured them using a laser level the results nine out of the 11 bags were larger than the manufacturer claimed so invest in a tape measure and when you measure a bag be sure to include the wheels and handle in your measurements be

       " 'you may know there s added sugar in your coke or cookies but did you know that it s in your salad dressing pasta sauce and bread the food and drug administration came out friday with its new template for nutrition labels one big change was the addition of a line for added sugar to be placed below a line for total sugar the change is designed to distinguish between sugars that are naturally occurring in a food like the milk sugar in a plain yogurt and the sugars that food manufacturers include later to boost flavors like the evaporated cane juice in a chobani kids strawberry yogurt a team of researchers at the university of north carolina conducted a detailed survey of the packaged foods and drinks that are purchased in american grocery stores and found that 60 percent of them include some form of added sugar when they looked at every individual processed food in the store 68 percent had added sugar some of those products are more obvious sugary foods but not all the list includes many sauces soups fruit juices and even meat products you might think it s easy to figure out whether the food manufacturer added sugar to your food but it isn t always so while some foods include sugar in their ingredients many use different words for products that are nutritionally similar most of us have heard of corn syrup a sugar made from processing corn but there are also things like the evaporated cane juice in the yogurt and rice syrup and which are less obvious and amount to the same thing barry popkin a professor of nutrition at the university of north carolina and one of the paper s authors said that the wide variety of sugars is not always meant to confound consumers instead he said the many sugar types are chosen by food scientists to give their products the best flavor and texture some sugars are better for baked goods while others are better in soft drinks some are also cheaper than others sugar tariffs and import laws make it expensive to bring in too much foreign sugar but not all of the sugar formulations count toward the laws quotas there s also the matter of fruit juice concentrates which are juices that have been stripped of nearly everything but sugar and evaporated a lot of seemingly natural foods include ingredients like apple juice concentrate that s sugar that will be a lot clearer when the labels are updated it s going to really surprise people who go to organic and whole foods stores when they find that all this natural food they ve been buying is full of added sugar mr popkin said it s full of fruit juice concentrates and they thought it was all good stuff the emphasis on added sugar comes from new nutrition guidelines that urge americans to consume a healthy dietary pattern containing certain types of foods according to the regulation hidden added sugars make it difficult to understand whether the food you are eating is part of that healthy pattern medical evidence shows that high sugar consumption is linked to obesity diabetes and tooth decay though not all of that work distinguishes between added sugar and total sugar many of the big food industry trade groups and lobbyists were satisfied with the new label rules as my colleague sabrina tavernise recently wrote but the sugar industry and the corn refiners are upset critics of the policy argue that the difference between natural and added sugars is not nutritionally meaningful and that the science establishing health harms from added sugar is weak the new label will kick in for large food companies in 2018 and for smaller companies a year later the u n c research used its master list of sugar code words to measure how many grocery store foods include sugar but measuring the precise amount of sugars that are added with the current label is quite difficult mr popkin said consumers would be surprised by recent research from his team revealing the large amounts of added sugars in products that are generally thought of as healthy foods like infant formula protein bars and yogurt ',\n",
       " 'istanbul the domes of the great mosques covered in white the soaring minarets that draw istanbul s singular skyline peeking out behind a gray haze of flurries the street carts selling roasted chestnuts the old tram making its way slowly the street cats huddling around heaters in cafes all gave the city the feel of an old photograph snow in istanbul always feels magical but for a few days this week and last a blizzard at more than a foot it was the heaviest snowfall since 2009 was just what the city needed it acted as a balm for the chronic fear and anxiety that had taken over amid terrorist attacks political instability and the deep purges of civil society that began after a failed coup last summer this all blends into a feeling of suspension of normal daily life said orhan pamuk a nobel laureate who coincidentally wrote an acclaimed novel called snow and perhaps this time because of horrors of politics tens of thousands of professors and people are being fired from their jobs and journalist and writer friends are being pushed into prisons at least for five minutes this is a consolation in his many books mr pamuk 64 has created a language of istanbul its intricacies its mysteries its landscapes for him a lifelong istanbul resident winter is bound up with youth and as the snow fell this week he was on the streets taking photographs and remembering what it was like to be a child in such a big city snow is highly intertwined with memories of childhood he said on a recent afternoon sitting in his apartment as the snow fell across the bosporus outside his window in istanbul memories and the city he wrote it is impossible for me to remember my childhood without this blanket of snow some children can t wait for the summer holiday to begin but i couldn t wait for it to snow not because i would be going outside to play in it but because it made the city look new not only by covering up the mud the filth the ruins and the neglect but by producing in every street and every view an element of surprise a delicious air of impending disaster the snow brought the expected inconveniences to a city that as mr pamuk wrote in the book is always caught unawares greeting each snowfall as if it were the first hundreds of flights were canceled ferry services that connect two continents europe and asia were halted and streets were impassable but there were many more pleasures the incessant construction and traffic fell silent normally gruff policemen engaged in snowball fights with children off from school sledded down the narrow streets all of this lent itself to a feeling of being stranded of time standing still and that is why it all felt so delicious to the city s residents who had become accustomed to a disorienting pace of bad news one attack after another one political crisis after another for a time even people seemed to forget that there was a killer on the loose that the turkish police had not yet apprehended the gunman in a new year s morning attack on a nightclub that left dozens dead the snow landed in istanbul like a rescuer from the recent traumatizing events aylin sokmen a turkish fiction writer wrote this week in an email nowadays watching the snowflakes for those who are lucky enough to be in a cozy home gives a sense of security from the troubling events while it s still a struggle for survival for some others getting a break from our lives evokes deep feelings such as remembrance of the past innocence nostalgia for childhood she added though it will not take long to face the uncontrollable narrative of the city of the country and of our lives and yes even amid the bliss of the snowfall there were intrusions this week the continuing fall in value of the turkish lira a debate in parliament about expanding the powers of president recep tayyip erdogan whom many already regard as an authoritarian leader but all that was a sideshow as people enjoyed the snow we come to this park every year when it snows it s always so beautiful said sophie 52 a teacher playing with her children who gave just her first name because as a civil servant she was not allowed to speak to a reporter it makes me so happy when schools are canceled on snow days because the work is very demanding especially at public schools and children finally get to rest in a city upended by divisions and unrest the snow showed a gentler side as city officials and business owners mobilized to care for the thousands of street dogs and cats that are as much a part of urban life here as tea shops and antiques sellers one photograph that went viral on social media showed dogs bundled up under blankets inside a shopping mall and probably for the first time in their lives syrian children among the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled civil war to take up uncertain lives in istanbul played in the snow what i will remember from this year s snow is the syrian children i saw who had perhaps encountered the first snow of their lives and were laughing in excitement said fatih demir 32 a photographer they were probably among those lucky enough to be off the streets and outside shelters having set up homes in the city with their families yet even while the snow provided a respite it was still obvious to some how much the city s mood had changed in recent times and how many fewer tourists there are snow is cleansing said ahmet koc 44 who owns a housewares store in cihangir a trendy neighborhood where many expatriates live it s so beautiful outside but when i look at people s faces i see sadness while the snowfall interrupted lives for many others kept to their routines murat pak 35 was out there on monday where he usually is despite the heavy snowfall fishing from the galata bridge which connects two of the city s european quarters across the golden horn waterway there were only a few other fishermen with him we don t feel the cold if we re catching fish he said today it s empty not because of the snow but because this past week there were no fish they must have gone to warmer deeper waters as the city began returning to its regular rhythms after the storm it was left with a feeling of being refreshed even as the weather report called for more snow in the coming days this quote holiday or sense of freedom a sense of not doing your regular thing is heavily intertwined with landscape beauties of the town and silence mr pamuk said i think that is what makes it magical ',\n",

the two million to three million undocumented immigrants that he said had criminal convictions cristina jiménez the executive director of united we dream the national organization promoting the interests of undocumented youth known as dreamers called the threat to immigrant communities imminent and added to be quite frank we fear the worst that is not to say that immigrants will be avoiding

also a sponsor of the women s march of which ms sarsour is one of the main organizers part of the mission statement of the women s march calls on immigrants of all statuses to attend but that event has a broader platform that includes issues of pay equity reproductive rights and safety from domestic violence organizers of the immigrant rally said that their protest aims to highlight the

there are black immigrants who we don t talk about ninaj raoul a founder and executive director of haitian women for haitian refugees said she had seen the immigration rights movement focus on the

voice to be heard in this movement ms raoul said not just for the incoming government where we have so many reasons to be worried but for the current government because of the actions they ve taken on

u s border arriving without visas and ordered deportations some pregnant women and mothers with children were given a temporary humanitarian reprieve to stay but their husbands were deported after hurricane matthew struck in early october the administration delayed deporting haitians but then resumed deportations in november for haitians who have been living in the united states with temporary protection granted after the earthquake that status that is set to expire in july ms raoul said that because hurricane matthew damaged food supplies those haitians did not know if they could return so

       " 'eighteen women and girls have filed a federal lawsuit alleging that a michigan doctor sexually assaulted them and that u s a gymnastics and other organizations that employed him failed to address their concerns and prevent further abuse some of it dating back to the late 1990s in the civil suit filed against dr lawrence nassar on tuesday in federal district court in western michigan the plaintiffs are seeking relief for injuries related to sexual assault nonconsensual touching abuse and molestation they say the abuse occurred while they were participating in gymnastics swimming figure skating track and field field hockey basketball and soccer most of the plaintiffs were minors when the abuse occurred according to the suit which alleges that dr nassar sexually assaulted abused and molested the athletes including by digital vaginal and anal penetration the lawsuit is the latest legal action against dr nassar in november he was charged in ingham county mich with sexual conduct with a person under 13 and in december he was indicted in federal court in grand rapids mich on child pornography charges matthew r newburg dr nassar s lawyer in those state and federal criminal cases said by email on wednesday that his client has pleaded not guilty in those cases we are still receiving discovery and continue to review the reports as we receive them he said stephen drew a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the new civil case said on wednesday that some of the 18 women had raised red flags as far back as 2000 the suit also names as defendants the places where he had worked or had treated athletes u s a gymnastics michigan state university and gedderts twistars gymnastics club u s a in michigan the plaintiffs said that dr nassar had been recommended to them as a renowned orthopedic sports medicine physician while working at the university from about 1996 to 2016 and for the united states gymnastics team from 1986 to 2015 he also provided medical care at twistars which has locations in dimondale mich and dewitt mich the lawsuit alleges that some of the plaintiffs had complained about being abused while being examined in a room alone with dr nassar or that he had positioned himself in such a way as to block the view of parents or chaperones mr drew said that some of the women and girls had not come forward sooner because they thought they would not be believed they need this addressed they have been holding this in for years he said adding that the impact on the plaintiffs has been traumatic adam c sturdivant another lawyer said that two or three more people were expected to join the civil lawsuit within a week mr newburg said that dr nassar does not yet have a lawyer for that case the lawsuit alleged that the three organizations had failed to properly supervise dr nassar were negligent in retaining him and did not address concerns from the athletes and their parents a statement from u s a gymnastics on wednesday did not directly address the latest lawsuit saying that it was pending litigation but the organization the sport s national governing body said it found the allegations against dr nassar very disturbing when we first learned of athlete concerns regarding dr nassar in the summer of 2015 we immediately notified the f b i and relieved him of any further assignments the statement said u s a gymnastics has fully cooperated with the f b i in its investigation we find it appalling that anyone would exploit a young athlete or child in this manner and we are grateful to the athletes who have come forward the reports of sexual abuse in the sport cast a shadow on the gymnastics federation just as the u s olympics team which brought home 12 medals from the 2016 games was preparing for a market push jason cody a spokesman for michigan state university said on wednesday he could not comment on the pending litigation but the university was deeply disturbed by the criminal charges he said in an emailed statement that the university had started an internal review and had found no evidence of any complaints about dr nassar before aug 29 2016 other than one in 2014 that was investigated but he added the criminal investigation into larry nassar is a top priority for m s u police john geddert a former olympic coach and the owner of twistars gymnastics school did not return telephone messages left at the center s two michigan locations on wednesday the lawsuit said dr nassar had been recommended to athletes there the suit said a parent of a gymnast in 1997 had complained to mr geddert about the doctor but that the concerns went unaddressed mr drew the lawyer said some of the plaintiffs in tuesday s civil case were emboldened to come forward after an investigation published by the indianapolis star in august on allegations of sexual abuse by coaches of young athletes the article included allegations that u s a gymnastics had routinely failed to notify law enforcement officials about sexual abuse claims a second report by the star published in september said two women had accused dr nassar of sexually abusing them one former gymnast rachael denhollander filed a police complaint that month against dr nassar who through his lawyer denied any wrongdoing the other woman a medalist on the 2000 united states olympic team filed a civil lawsuit against him and named u s a

       " 'the sports landscape is littered with failed professional football leagues such is the dominance of the n f l yet the sports agent don yee who represents new england patriots quarterback tom brady thinks he may have found a model that will work a league for to players who skip college to play professionally right away most fledgling leagues like the defunct u f l or the x f l had rosters filled with castoffs who had gone undrafted out of college or who had bounced around pro teams the quality of play was uneven while games often overlapped with the n f l and n c a a calendars making it hard to gain attention yee and his investment group see their new pacific pro football league which is expected to start in summer 2018 as more of a development league filled with players who want to immediately start playing a game while getting a paycheck rather than risking injury on a college team and receiving no compensation most other leagues usually took players who were deemed not good enough for the n f l yee said we re now trying to go to the head of the line at the buffet instead of getting the ones despite the long odds of success yee is not the only person trying to get a football league off the ground in april a new spring league will roll out in west virginia where players who may have been overlooked by the n f l c f l and other professional leagues can pay 350 to showcase their talents in a season the league s website says the n f l also has toyed with starting a developmental league in october commissioner roger goodell said the team owners had discussed the idea of working with 300 to 400 players to make them ready to play as quickly as possible though nothing concrete emerged from the discussions other leagues already employ teenagers who skip college major league baseball clubs draft young players and send them to their academies or minor league affiliates many n h l teams have players as young as 18 on their rosters players can join n b a teams if they are 19 and a year removed from high school in 2001 the n b a started its own development league where the players can be 18 n f l teams can draft only players who are three years removed from their high school class s graduation a rule the league said is intended to protect younger less physically developed players the physical mental and emotional demands of our sport would make it almost impossible for someone to have success in the n f l at an earlier age said brian mccarthy a league spokesman richard lapchick the director of the institute for diversity and ethics in sport or tides said that the n f l had an incentive not to undercut college football which he said was a great feeder system even with an alternate league college football where players get scholarships but are not paid would remain a strong draw for high school players because of the potential exposure he said he added that requiring athletes to spend more time in college makes it more likely that they will be prepared for life in the n f l and after they retire from the game i don t know how broad the interest in academic development is by the pro leagues but someone who has a broader range of interests has a more balanced life and has the potential to be a better athlete he said yee acknowledged that his venture was risky something his advisers have echoed fans already have a lot of options for watching college and professional football and just paying for the necessary training facilities and transportation could be enough to bankrupt a new league i ve danced with at least three of these groups before but money was always what killed them said jim steeg who is an unpaid adviser to yee and ran the super bowl for the n f l for decades steeg estimated that between 5 million and 7 million would be needed to cover the costs of each team for one season along with a comparable sum to run the league office still steeg was encouraged that yee was starting small and aiming for a unique pool of players and that he had already received funding from an angel investor yee said he hoped to attract enough money in the next phase of to cover the cost of a first season the league would have four teams based in southern california both to reduce expenses and because the region has so many young players the league would have a schedule plus playoffs and finish before the college season begins players would be paid an average of 50 000 in salary and benefits including workers compensation a 401 k plan and free community college tuition yee wants to partner with companies in the area to create internships for the players to prepare them for when their football days are over in addition to steeg yee said he was being advised by among others the former n f l coach mike shanahan mike pereira who was in charge of officiating for the n f l and the espn analyst adam schefter ed mccaffrey a former denver broncos wide receiver is a having enough money to get a league off the ground is one challenge finding a way to publicize it is another with television already cluttered with dozens of games each week the chances of a new league finding space on a widely distributed cable network are remote yee said that internet giants like amazon and netflix were looking for sports content to distribute it is far from clear however whether one of those companies will pay yee s league to show games ',\n",

scholars had no trouble finding satisfying explanations a leading theory held that this was the skeleton of a lost bowlegged cossack with rickets the peculiar bony ridge over the man s eyes was a result of the poor cossack s perpetually furrowing his brow in pain because of the rickets one british geologist william king suspected something more radical instead of being the remains of an atypical human they might have belonged to a typical member of an alternate humanity in 1864 he published a paper introducing it as such an extinct human species the first ever discovered king named this species after the valley where it was found which itself had been named for the ecstatic poet who once wandered it he called it homo neanderthalensis neanderthal man who was neanderthal man king felt obligated to describe him but with no established techniques for interpreting archaeological material like the skull he fell back on racism and phrenology he focused on the peculiarities of the neanderthal s skull including the enormously projecting brow no living humans had skeletal features remotely like these but king was under the impression that the skulls of contemporary african and australian aboriginals resembled the neanderthals more than ordinary skulls so extrapolating from his low opinion of what he called these savage races he explained that the neanderthal s skull alone was proof of its moral darkness and stupidity the thoughts and desires which once dwelt within it never soared beyond those of a brute he wrote other scientists piled on so did the popular press we knew almost nothing about neanderthals but already we assumed they were ogres and losers the genesis of this idea the historian paige madison notes largely comes down to flukes of timing and luck while king was working another british scientist george busk had the same suspicions about the neander skull he had received a comparable one too from the tiny british territory of gibraltar the gibraltar skull was dug up long before the neander valley specimen surfaced but local hobbyists simply labeled it human skull and forgot about it for the next 16 years its brow ridge wasn t as prominent as the neander skull s and its features were less imposing it was a woman s skull it turns out busk dashed off a quick report but stopped short of naming the new creature he hoped to study additional fossils and learn more privately he considered calling it homo calpicus or gibraltar man so what if busk a conscientious naturalist too cautious to make premature claims as madison describes him had beaten king to publication consider how different our first impressions of a gibraltar woman might have been from those of neanderthal man what feelings of sympathy or even kinship this other skull might have stirred there is a worldview the opposite of joachim neander s that sees our planet as a product of only tumult and indifference in such a world it s possible for an entire species to be ground into extinction by forces beyond its control and then 40 000 years later be dug up and made to endure an additional century and a half of bad luck and abuse that s what happened to the neanderthals and it s what we did to them but recently after we d snickered over their skulls for so long it stopped being clear who the boneheads were i ll start with a confession an embarrassing but relevant one because i would come to see our history with neanderthals as continually distorted by an unfortunate human tendency to believe in ideas that are in reality incorrect and then to leverage that conviction into a feeling of superiority over other people and in retrospect i realize i demonstrated that same tendency myself at the beginning of this project because i don t want to come off as or as pointing fingers here goes before traveling to gibraltar last summer i had no idea what gibraltar was or rather i was sure i knew what gibraltar was but i was wrong i thought it was just that famous rock an unpopulated hunk of geology which if i m being honest i recognized mostly from the prudential logo that limestone protuberance at the mouth of the mediterranean that elephantine white molar jutting into the sky true i was traveling to gibraltar on short notice when i the director of the gibraltar museum clive finlayson he told me the museum happened to be starting its annual excavation of a neanderthal cave there the following week and invited me to join still even a couple of days before i left when a friend told me she faintly remembered spending an afternoon in gibraltar once as a teenager i gently mansplained to her that i was pretty sure she was mistaken gibraltar i told her wasn t somewhere you could just go in my mind i had privileged access i pictured myself and finlayson taking a special little boat in fact gibraltar is a peninsula connected to spain it s a lively british overseas territory with 30 000 citizens living in a city on its western side a city with bakeries and clothing stores and tourists buying all the usual kitsch some unusual kitsch too like a laminated child s place mat i spotted that in a typical tourist destination might say something unexceptional like someone who loves me went to gibraltar but here read we shall never surrender british forever the history of gibraltar given its strategic location is a grinding saga of military sieges and ruthlessly contested changes in ownership the residue of that strife today is a pronounced british patriotism and a exchange of slights with spain which still disputes britain s claim to the territory after queen elizabeth ii s diamond jubilee in 2012 when gibraltar projected towering images of her majesty on a side of the rock a clear act of provocation one reporter called it spain began inspecting vehicle after vehicle at the border backing up the line for hours stranding the bulk of gibraltar s work force who commute in every day the afternoon i showed up activists from a spanish political party had crossed into gibraltar and hung an enormous spanish flag high up on the rock this wasn t just mischief it was regarded as an act of symbolic terrorism when one of the men appeared in court two days later i read a woman screamed at him gibraltar will never be spanish she sounded like that defiant place mat come to life i happened to arrive in gibraltar the week of the brexit vote up in england people were thundering about the working class versus elites sovereignty and immigration warning that british identity was being fouled by the european project but in gibraltar a fully detached nib of britain flanked by water on two sides and spain on the third the question was less philosophical if the united kingdom left the european union spain might seize the opportunity to isolate gibraltar leaving the territory to shrivel up like a flap of dead skin the gibraltarian government had already called on the house of commons for help there was concern that spain would jam up the border again and that it might happen right away around town remain signs hung everywhere the atmosphere was edgy as though everyone was holding hands waiting to see whether a meteor would hit it was like the hairline cracks between so many and thems seemed to be widening and some corrosive molten goop was seeping out mutual dependence curdled with contempt clearly it was happening back home in america too all in all it was a good week to spend in a cave gorham s cave is on gibraltar s eastern coast a tremendous opening at the bottom of the sheer face of the rock shadowy and like a cathedral its mouth is 200 feet across at the base and 120 feet tall it tapers asymmetrically like a crumpled wizard s hat neanderthals inhabited gorham s cave on and off for 100 000 years as well as a second cave next to it called vanguard cave the artifacts they left behind were buried as wind pushed sand into the cave this created a high sloping dune composed of hundreds of distinct layers of sand each of which was once the surface of the dune the floor of the cave the dune is enormous it reaches about of the way up gorham s walls spilling out of the cave s mouth and onto the rocky beach like a colossal cat s tongue lapping at the mediterranean every summer since 1989 a team of archaeologists has returned to meticulously clear that sand away and recover the material inside i realized a long time ago i won t live to see the end of this project finlayson who leads the excavation told me but i think we re in a great moment we re beginning to understand these people after a century of putting them down as apelike brutes neanderthals are people too a separate branch of our family tree we last shared an ancestor at some point between 500 000 and 750 000 years ago then our evolutionary trajectory split we evolved in africa while the neanderthals would live in europe and asia for 300 000 years or as little as 60 000 years it depends whom you ask it always does the study of human origins i found is riddled with vehement disagreements and scientists who readily dismantle the premises of even the most questions in this case the uncertainty rests in part on when in this long evolutionary process neanderthals officially became neanderthals what is clearer is that roughly 40 000 years ago just as our own lineage expanded from africa and took over eurasia the neanderthals disappeared scientists have always assumed that the timing wasn t coincidental maybe we used our superior intellects to outcompete the neanderthals for resources maybe we clubbed them all to death whatever the mechanism of this replacement it seemed to imply that our kind was somehow better than their kind we re still here after all and their path ended as soon as we crossed paths but neanderthals weren t the louts we ve imagined them to be not just a bunch of neanderthals as a review of findings published last year put it they were actually very similar to their contemporary homo sapiens in africa in terms of standard markers of modern cognitive and behavioral capacities we ve always classified neanderthals technically as human part of the genus homo but it turns out they also did the stuff that you know makes us human neanderthals buried their dead they made jewelry and specialized tools they made ocher and other pigments perhaps to paint their faces or bodies evidence of a symbolically mediated worldview as archaeologists call it their tracheal anatomy suggests that they were capable of language and probably had raspy voices like julia child they manufactured glue from birch bark which required heating the bark to at least 644 degrees fahrenheit a feat scientists find difficult to duplicate without a ceramic container in gibraltar there s evidence that neanderthals extracted the feathers of certain birds only dark feathers possibly for aesthetic or ceremonial purposes and while neanderthals were once presumed to be crude scavengers we now know they exploited the different terrains on which they lived they took down dangerous game including an extinct species of rhinoceros some ate seals and other marine mammals some ate shellfish some ate chamomile they had regional cuisines they used toothpicks wearing feathers eating seals maybe none of this sounds particularly impressive but it s what our human ancestors were capable of back then too and scientists have always considered such behavioral flexibility and complexity as signs of our specialness when it came to neanderthals though many researchers literally couldn t see the evidence sitting in front of them a lot of the new thinking about neanderthals comes from revisiting material in museum collections excavated decades ago and it with new technology or simply with open minds the real surprise of these discoveries may not be the competence of neanderthals but how obnoxiously low our expectations for them have been the bias with which too many scientists approached that other us one archaeologist called these researchers modern human supremacists inside gorham s cave archaeologists were excavating what they called a hearth not a physical fireplace but a spot in the sand where around 50 000 years ago neanderthals lit a fire each summer the gibraltar museum employs students from universities in england and spain to work the dig and now two young women one from each country sat under work lights clearing sand away with the edge of a trowel and a brush to leave a cube a black band of charcoal ran through it the students worked scrupulously watching for small animal bones or artifacts they d pulled out a butchered ibex mandible a number of mollusk shells and husks they d also found six chunks of fossilized hyena dung as well as débitage distinctive shards of flint left over when neanderthals shattered larger pieces to make axes the cube of sand would eventually be wrapped in plaster and sent for analysis the sand the two women were sweeping into their dustpans was transferred into plastic bags and marched out of the cave down to the beach where other students sieved it smaller bones caught in the sieve were bagged and labeled even the sand that passed through the sieve was saved and driven back to a lab at the museum where i would later find three other students picking through it with magnifying glasses and tweezers searching for tinier stuff rodent teeth spines while listening to call me maybe to an outsider it looked preposterous the archaeologists were cataloging and storing absolutely everything treating this physical material as though it were digital information jpegs of itself and yet they couldn t afford not to everything a neanderthal came into contact with was a valuable clue in 28 years of excavations here archaeologists have yet to find a fossil of an actual neanderthal this is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle where you only have five pieces finlayson said he somehow made this analogy sound exciting instead of hopeless by that point the enormousness of what they didn t know what they could never know had become a distraction for me one of the dig s lead archaeologists richard jennings of liverpool john moores university listed the many items they had found around that hearth and this is literally just from two squares he said a square in archaeology is one meter by one meter sites are divided into grids of squares then jennings waved wordlessly at the rest of the cave look at the big picture he was saying imagine what else we ll find there was also vanguard cave next door an even more promising site because while gorham s had been partly excavated by less meticulous scientists in the 1940s and 50s finlayson s team was the first to touch vanguard already they had uncovered a layer of perfectly preserved mud there we suspect if there s a place where you re going to find the first neanderthal footprint it will be here finlayson said the resolution of the caves was incredible the wind blew sand in so fast that it preserved short periods faithfully like entries in a diary finlayson has described it as the longest and most detailed record of neanderthals way of life that is currently available this was the good news and yet there were more than 20 other nearby caves that the gibraltar neanderthals might have used and they were now underwater behind us when sea levels rose around 20 000 years ago the mediterranean drowned them it also drowned the wooded savanna between gorham s and the former coastline where presumably the neanderthals had spent an even larger share of their lives and left even more artifacts so yes jennings was right there was a lot of cave left to dig through but it was like looking for needles in a haystack and the entire haystack was merely the one needle they had managed to find in an astronomically larger haystack and most of that haystack was now inaccessible forever i could tell it wasn t productive to dwell on the problem at this scale while picking husks from the hearth but there it was look you can almost see what s happening finlayson eventually said the fire and the charcoal the embers scattering it was true if you followed that stratum of sand away from the hearth you could see embedded in the wall behind us black flecks where the smoke and cinders from this fire had blown suddenly it struck me though it should have earlier that what we were looking at were the remnants of a single event a specific fire on a specific night made by specific neanderthals maybe this won t sound that profound but it snapped that prehistoric abstraction into focus this wasn t just a hearth i realized it was a campfire finlayson began narrating the scene for me a few neanderthals cooked the ibex they had hunted and the mussels and nuts they had foraged and then after dinner made some tools around the fire after they went to sleep and the fire died out a hyena slinked in to scavenge scraps from the ashes and took a poop then perhaps that same night the wind picked up and covered everything with the fine layer of sand that these students were now brushing away while we stood talking one of the women uncovered a small flint ax called a levallois flake after 50 000 years the edge was still sharp they let me touch it one of the earliest authorities on neanderthals was a frenchman named marcellin boule a lot of what he said was wrong in 1911 boule began publishing his analysis of the first nearly complete neanderthal skeleton ever discovered which he named old man of la chapelle after the limestone cave where it was found laboring to reconstruct the old man s anatomy he deduced that its head must have been slouched forward its spine hunched and its toes spread like an ape s then having reassembled the neanderthal this way boule insulted it this brutish and clumsy posture he wrote clearly indicated a lack of morals and a lifestyle dominated by functions of a purely vegetative or bestial kind a colleague of boule s went further claiming that neanderthals usually walked on all fours and never laughed had no smile boule was part of a movement trying to reconcile natural selection with religion by portraying neanderthals as closer to animals than to us he could protect the ideal of a separate immaculate human lineage when he consulted with an artist to make a rendering of the neanderthal it came out looking like a furry mean gorilla neanderthal fossils kept surfacing in europe and scholars like boule were scrambling to make sense of them improvising what would later grow into a new interdisciplinary field now known as paleoanthropology the evolution of that science was haphazard and often comically unscientific an exhaustive history by erik trinkaus and pat shipman describes how neanderthals became mirrors that reflected in all their awfulness and awesomeness the nature and humanity of those who touched them that included a lot of human blundering it became clear only in 1957 for example 46 years after boule and after several of the old man s skeleton that boule s particular neanderthal which led him to imagine all neanderthals as oafs actually just had several deforming injuries and severe osteoarthritis still boule s influence was over the years his ideologically tainted image of neanderthals was often refracted through the lens of other ideologies occasionally racist ones in 1930 the prominent british anthropologist sir arthur keith writing in the new york times channeled boule s work to justify colonialism for keith the replacement of an ancient inferior species like neanderthals by newer heartier homo sapiens proved that britain s actions in australia the white man replacing the most ancient type of brown man known to us was part of a natural order that had been operating for millenniums it s easy to get snooty about all this unenlightened paleoanthropology of the past but all sciences operate by trying to fit new data into existing theories and this particular science for which the data has always consisted of scant and somewhat inscrutable bits of rock and fossil often has to lean on those even more heavily assumptions theories expectations the university of barcelona archaeologist joão zilhão says all must come into play a lot because you are interpreting data that do not speak for themselves imagine for example working in a cave without any skulls or other easily distinguishable fossils and trying to figure out if you re looking at a neanderthal settlement or a more recent modern human one in the past scientists might turn to the surrounding artifacts interpreting more tools as evidence of neanderthals and more tools as evidence of early modern humans but working that way it s easy to miss evidence of neanderthals resemblance to us because as soon as you see it you assume they were us so many techniques similarly hinge on interpretation and judgment even perfectly ones like morphometric analysis identifying fossils as belonging to one species rather than another by comparing particular parts of their anatomy and radiocarbon dating how the material to be dated is sampled and how results are calibrated are susceptible to drastic revision and bitter disagreement what s more because of an infuriating quirk of physics the effectiveness of radiocarbon dating happens to break down around 40 000 years ago right around the time of the neanderthal extinction one of our best tools for looking into the past becomes unreliable at exactly the moment we re most interested in examining ultimately a bottomless relativism can creep in tenuous interpretations held up by webs of other interpretations each strung from still more interpretations almost every archaeologist i interviewed complained that the field has become overinterpreted that the ratio of physical evidence to speculation about that evidence is out of whack good stories can generate their own momentum starting in the 1920s older and more exciting hominid fossils like homo erectus began surfacing in africa and asia and the field soon shifted its focus there the washington university anthropologist erik trinkaus who began his career in the early 70s told me when i started working on neanderthals nobody really cared about them the liveliest question about neanderthals was still the first one were they our direct ancestors or the endpoint of a separate evolutionary track scientists called this question the neanderthal problem some of the theories worked up to answer it encouraged different visions of neanderthal intelligence and behavior the multiregional model for example which had us descending from neanderthals was more inclined to see them as capable sympathetic and fundamentally human the opposing out of africa hypothesis which held that we moved in and replaced them cast them as comparatively inferior for decades when evidence of a more advanced neanderthal way of life turned up it was often explained away or mobbed by enough contrary or undermining interpretations that over time it never found real purchase some findings broke through more than others however like the discovery of what was essentially a small neanderthal cemetery in shanidar cave in what is now iraqi kurdistan there had been many compelling instances of neanderthals burying their dead but shanidar was harder to ignore especially after soil samples revealed the presence of huge amounts of pollen this was interpreted as the remains of a funerary floral arrangement an archaeologist at the center of this work ralph solecki published a book called shanidar the first flower people it was 1971 the age of aquarius those flowers he d go on to write proved that neanderthals had soul u2009 then again solecki s idea was eventually discredited in 1999 a more thorough analysis of the shanidar grave site found that neanderthals almost certainly did not leave flowers there the pollen had been tracked in thousands of years later by burrowing rodents that said even a later there are still paleoanthropologists at work on this question it might not have been gerbils it may have been bees as more supposed anomalies surfaced they became harder to brush off in 1996 the paleoanthropologist hublin and others used ct scanning technology to a bone fragment found in a french cave decades earlier alongside a raft of advanced tools and artifacts associated with the châtelperronian industry which archaeologists always presumed was the work of early modern humans now hublin s analysis identified the bone as belonging to a neanderthal but rather than reascribe the châtelperronian industry to neanderthals hublin chalked up his findings to acculturation surely the neanderthals must have learned how to make this stuff by watching us to me says zilhão the university of barcelona archaeologist there was a logical shock if the paradigm forces you to say something like this there must be something wrong with the paradigm zilhão published a stinging critique challenging the field to shake off its prejudice papers were fired back and forth igniting what zilhão calls a war and counting then in the middle of that war geneticists shook up the paradigm completely a group at the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig germany led by svante paabo had been assembling a draft sequence of a neanderthal genome using dna recovered from bones their findings were published in 2010 it had already become clear by then that homo sapiens and neanderthals appeared in eurasia separately out of africa was essentially right but paabo s work revealed that before the neanderthals disappeared the two groups mated even today 40 000 years after our gene pools stopped mixing most living humans still carry neanderthal dna making up roughly 1 to 2 percent of our total genomes the data shows that we also apparently bred with other hominids like the denisovans about which very little is known it was staggering even paabo couldn t bring himself to believe it at first but the results were the results and they carried a sort of empirical magnetism that archaeological evidence lacks geneticists are much more powerful numerous and incomparably better funded than anyone else dealing with this stuff zilhão said he joked their aura is kind of miraculous it s a bit like receiving the ten commandments from god paabo s work and a continuing wave of genomic research has provided clarity but also complexity recasting our oppositional relationship into something more communal and collaborative and perhaps not just on the genetic level the extent of the interbreeding supported previous speculation by a minority of paleoanthropologists that there might have been cases of neanderthals and modern humans living alongside each other intermeshed for centuries and that generations of their offspring had found places in those communities too then again it s also possible that some of the interbreeding was forced paabo now recommends against imagining separate species of human evolution altogether not an us and a them but one enormous metapopulation composed of shifting clusters of essentially things that periodically coincided in time and space and when they happened to bump into one another occasionally had sex lunch happened at the mouth of gorham s cave out in the sun i ate a sandwich on a log facing the sea alongside jennings and a few of his liverpool students while the young men and women from spain mingled behind us laughing and stretching and helping one another crack their backs the language barrier seemed to discourage the two cohorts from talking much and yet the students lived together during the excavation and had somehow achieved a muffled camaraderie even jennings and his counterpart josé maría gutiérrez lópez a veteran archaeologist from a museum in cádiz had a somewhat similar dynamic despite working closely together for many summers at gorham s neither was terribly fluent in the other s language but their silence by this point seemed warm and knowing waiting for our ride at the end of one workday i noticed them staring at a plastic bag snagged in the concertina wire above an old military gate the bag had been there for a long long time jennings told me then he turned and uttered cinco años gutiérrez lópez smiled sí he said nodding i meanwhile felt compelled to test out all of this as a model for relations that contact obsessed me what would it have been like to look out over a grassy plain and watch parallel humanity pass by scientists often turn to historical first contacts as frames of reference like the arrival of europeans among native americans or captain cook landing in australia largely histories of violence and subjugation but as zilhão points out typically one of those two cultures set out to conquer the other those people were conscious that they d come from somewhere else he told me they were a product of a civilization that had books that had studied their past homo sapiens encountering neanderthals would have been different they met uncoupled from politics and history neither identified as part of a network of millions of supposedly more advanced people and so as finlayson put it to me each valley could have told a different story in one they may have hit each other over the head in another they may have made love in another they ignored each other it s a kind of coexistence that our modern imaginations may no longer be sensitive enough to envision so much of our identity as a species is tied up in our anomalousness in our dominion over others but that narcissistic is an exceedingly recent privilege outside the world of tolkienesque fantasy literature we tend to think that it is normal for there to be just one human species on earth at a time the writers dimitra papagianni and michael a morse explain the past 20 or 30 millennia however have been the exception now eating lunch i considered that the of humans and neanderthals hadn t been so trippy or profound after all maybe it looked as mundane as this two groups lingering on a beach only sort of acknowledging each other maybe the many millenniums during which we shared eurasia was much of the time like a superlong elevator ride with strangers some paleoanthropologists are starting to reimagine the extinction of neanderthals as equally prosaic not the culmination of some epic clash of civilizations but an aggregate result of a long ecological muddle strictly speaking extinction is what happens after a species fails to maintain a higher proportion of births to deaths it s a numbers game and so the real competition between neanderthals and early modern humans wasn t localized quarrels for food or territory but a quiet demographic marathon each species repopulating itself until one fell so far behind that it vanished and we had a big head start when modern humans came notes chris stringer a paleoanthropologist at britain s natural history museum there just weren t that many neanderthals around for millenniums some scientists believe before modern humans poured in from africa the climate in europe was exceptionally unstable the landscape kept flipping between temperate forest and cold treeless steppe the fauna that neanderthals subsisted on kept migrating away faster than they could though neanderthals survived this turbulence they were never able to build up their numbers across all of eurasia at any point in history says john hawks an anthropologist at the university of there probably weren t enough of them to fill an n f l stadium with the demographics so skewed stringer went on even the slightest modern human advantage would be amplified tremendously a single innovation something like sewing needles might protect just enough babies from the elements to lower the infant mortality rate and allow modern humans to conclusively overtake the neanderthals and yet stringer is careful not to conflate innovation with superior intelligence innovation too can be a function of population size we live in an age where information where good ideas spread like wildfire and we build on them stringer told me but it wasn t like that 50 000 years ago the more members your species has the more likely one member will stumble on a useful new technology and that once stumbled upon the innovation will spread you need sufficient human tinder for those sparks of culture to catch there was nothing inevitable about modern human success stringer says it was luck we didn t defeat the neanderthals we just swamped them trinkaus compares it to how european wildcats are currently disappearing absorbed into much larger populations of house cats gone feral it wasn t a flattering analogy we are the house cats but that was trinkaus s point i think a lot of this is basically banal he says showing me around the gibraltar museum one morning finlayson described the petering out of neanderthals on the rock with unnerving pathos gibraltar with its comparatively stable climate would have been one of their last refuges he explained and he likened the population there to critically endangered species today like snow leopards or imperiled butterflies living relics carrying on in small fragmented populations long after they ve passed a genetic point of no return they became a ghost species finlayson said we happened to be standing in front of two neanderthals exquisitely lifelike sculptures the museum unveiled last spring on a sweep of sand in their own austere gallery they were scientific reconstructions extrapolated by artists from casts of actual fossils these two were based on the only neanderthal skulls ever recovered in gibraltar that first woman s skull sent to george busk in 1864 and another of a child unearthed in 1926 they were called nana and flint finlayson s wife geraldine and son stewart both scientists who work closely with him at the museum had helped him come up with the names the boy had his arms thrown around nana s waist his cheek on her thigh he was himself behind her leg as kids do but also stared out straight at us slightly alarmed or helpless i don t get tired of looking at them finlayson said he had commissioned the neanderthals from dutch artists known as kennis kennis and he was initially taken aback by the woman s posture in their sketches she stood oddly with her arms crossed in front of her chest resting on opposite shoulders as if she were but kennis kennis barraged him with ethnographic photos real people standing just like this or even more strangely their hands behind their necks or slung over their heads as it happens the artists had an intense personal interest in where human beings leave their hands when they don t have pockets i d never thought about this before i ve always had pockets and i wondered if artists might expose these perceptual bubbles more pointedly than archaeologists kennis kennis appeared to be major players in the tiny field of paleolithic reconstruction scientists who had worked with them encouraged me to seek them out they re great people one archaeologist told me hyperactive like rubber balls the kennis brothers adrie and alfons are each 50 years old identical twins they are sturdy attractive men with dark wildly swirling hair and live in the small dutch city of arnhem southeast of amsterdam when i arrived at adrie s house last summer i found alfons at the end of the driveway glasses sliding down his nose carefully filling a crack in the robin butt cheek of a silicon neanderthal mold kennis kennis had gradually adrie s house as a second studio most of their work and materials were here headless bodies of various human species and a wall of shelves filled with skulls and heads the heads were frighteningly realistic with glass eyes and fleshy faces that begged to be touched when the brothers fly around europe to pitch to museums they take these heads with them like salesmen s samples on the airplane we have heads adrie shouted they scan things alfons shouted and slowly i understood the brothers thought it was hilarious that airport security never questioned them about their duffel bags full of heads i never have to open my bags adrie said then he scampered to the wall where a particular head had caught his eye very with a rough bushy beard and rawness in its upper lip a reconstruction of a primitive homo sapiens skull found in morocco adrie held the head in his palm and hollered bowling while pretending to bowl with it then he laughed and laughed and laughed that was how it went for the rest of the day they spoke in a bifurcated riot seldom finishing sentences just skipping ahead once they had spit out the key words and if a thought escaped them or their english faltered they didn t go silent instead they repeated the last word or made a strange guttural drone as if thrusting some heavy weight over their heads to fill the space their first big commission came in 2006 for the neanderthal museum on the site of neander valley it emerged as a jovial old man with woefulness or maybe just exhaustion behind his eyes that jolt of neanderthal individuality has been a trademark of their work ever since it elevates neanderthals out of a single homogeneous abstraction and endows them with personhood at one point adrie described watching a neighbor spend an entire day each brick of his driveway he had an epiphany all the types of people around us there must have been neanderthals just like them alfons added neanderthal neat freaks neanderthal bill gates what the brothers want they told me is for the viewer to catch herself relating to the neanderthal to recognize in a visceral way that neanderthals sit at the fragile edge of our own identities to feel that adrie explained they need to look you in the eye they were obsessed the only word for it and have been since age 7 when alfons found a picture of a neanderthal skeleton in a book and it instantly possessed them both they spent a lot of time at their parents restaurant after school and on weekends with nothing to do they started drawing neanderthals they drew feverishly combatively each brother keenly aware of whose rib cage looked brawnier who had rendered more beautiful shadows on his neanderthal s upper lip we were both the dumbest guys in the whole school alfons said we couldn t count drawing was all they knew how to do as young men they tried to teach art but couldn t find steady employment their family told them to give up their crazy preoccupation they wouldn t they made art at night and took custodial jobs at a psychiatric hospital they organized the christmas talent show and played with the residents initially they were painters not sculptors they made reconstructions only to have lifelike models to paint they were that meticulous that fixated on knowing how the musculature of a neanderthal hung off its skeleton because they had to produce a individual the brothers were forced to make decisions about what paleoanthropologists had the luxury of describing as spectra of variation geneticists can suggest a probable scope of skin and hair colors but the brothers must imagine the wear on a particular neanderthal s skin after a hard life outside or the abuse his toenails would take and would neanderthals wear ponytails would they shear their bangs away to get their hair out of their faces every culture does something with their hair alfons insisted there s no culture that does nothing with their hair this uncorked a frantic seminar on known global hairstyles of the last several thousand years they began pulling up photos on adrie s laptop dozens of them from anthropological archives or stills from old ethnographic films these were some of the same photos they had shown finlayson the brothers had pored over them for years but still gasped or bellowed now as each new improbable human form materialized the pictures showed a panorama of divergent body types and grooming spiky eyebrows astonishingly asymmetrical breasts a towering aboriginal man with the chiseled torso of an american underwear model but two twigs for legs a hottentot woman with an extraordinarily convex rear end people would never let us make buttocks like this alfons said regretfully all this variation it s beautiful shouted adrie refusing to look away from the screen he had to look these were reaches of reality that our minds didn t travel to on their own if you live in the west you d never imagine he went on the brothers delight seemed to come from feeling all these superficial differences quiver against a profound sameness finally adrie turned to me and said very seriously these are all homo sapiens they showed me more photos it s real it s real it s real alfons kept shouting adrie said unimaginable unimaginable unimaginable it only registered later i had spent the day with identical twins who since childhood have been stupefied by how different human beings can be at the rear of gorham s cave past the hearth the team was excavating there was a tall metal staircase it led up to a long catwalk which led to a locked steel gate i waited there one morning while finlayson fumbled around in his pocket then he turned his key the excavation had worked through this narrowed rear chamber of the cave years earlier and discovered at the end of the 2012 season an engraving on the floor a crosshatched pattern of 13 grooves in the bedrock a tide of specialists flowed into gorham s they determined that the engraving was made at least 39 000 years ago and ruled out its having been created inadvertently left over after skinning an animal say in controlled experiments it took between 188 and 317 strokes with a flint tool to create the entire figure what we ve always said finlayson explained is it s intentional and it s not functional you can call that art if you like the finding was published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences in 2014 the news media called the engraving the hashtag one scientist described the elaborate crosshatch as watershed evidence of neanderthals capacity for complex symbolic thought and abstract expression but several archaeologists told me they believe that there are many clearer signs of neanderthals capacity for complex cognition and symbolism including a discovery in southern france last year that seemed to dwarf the hashtag s significance more than 1 000 feet into the bruniquel cave neanderthals assembled two rings of 400 deliberately broken stalagmites with other material piled and propped around it like a labyrinth or a shrine but finlayson was undaunted he turned the hashtag into a logo for the rebranding of his museum there was a hashtag decal on the van he picked me up in every morning we stood and talked for a while until finally with richard aplomb finlayson lifted a tarp and showed it to me it did not make a tremendous impact at first it was lines in rock but finlayson went on pointing to a spot near the entrance to this isolated anteroom a few feet across from the engraving where the team had excavated another hearth neanderthals built fires in that exact spot on and off for 8 000 years he said until their disappearance from gibraltar but few animal bones were recovered here it wasn t a place they cooked and the location of the fire was also puzzling neanderthals usually situated fires at the fronts of caves to control smoke and yet finlayson explained if you look up this has a natural chimney we flung our heads back a chute coursed through the high craggy ceiling above us it seemed finlayson explained that the neanderthals did their butchering and cooking at the front of gorham s then retired here at night lighting a fire at this hearth would block the narrowest point in the cave sealing off this chamber from predators you could hang out here finlayson said have a snack or something then head to bed see there he said motioning to a smaller opening to our right it led to a second room similar to this one this finlayson said is the bedroom i looked again at the hashtag it wasn t on the cave floor exactly as it was usually described but on a broad ledge a foot or two off the ground it made for a perfect bench and it was suddenly easy to imagine a neanderthal sitting on it in ideal proximity to the fire for all i knew the hashtag marked his or her favorite seat but finlayson wasn t done after the neanderthal artifacts disappear from gorham s sediment layers there s a gap of many thousand years a thick stack of empty sand then other artifacts appear modern humans occupied the cave and built a fire here too just a couple of feet from the neanderthals hearth they used the bedroom annex as well they left a cave painting on the wall in there a gorgeous red stag indisputably recognizable to us their descendants as art another 18 000 years passed give or take the phoenicians came and they left offerings back here there were shards of their ceramics under the catwalk we had just crossed then 2 000 years after that in 1907 a certain captain a gorham of britain s second battalion royal munster fusiliers arrived gorham didn t discover gorham s cave finlayson told me it had always been impossible to miss that s what he found finlayson said that s really gorham s cave he pointed to the bedroom and we both turned bathing it with our headlamps beside the entrance was written in big block letters gorham s cave 1907 with a chunky black arrow pointing to the doorway gorham had written his name directly over the spot where some 39 000 years earlier a neanderthal had made his or her own mark the full sweep and synchronicity of this history hadn t seemed to occur to finlayson before hesitantly he said maybe there are special places in the world that have universal human appeal i felt a similar uncanny rush when i noticed that at some point while he talked we had each instinctually taken a seat on the rock ledge next to the hashtag and were now sitting side by side staring into space where the two ancient campfires once burned it s not an especially spiritual experience when one human being walks into another human being s kitchen for the first time and simply knows where the silverware drawer is at the back of gorham s though that intuition was spread across two distinct kinds of humans and tens of thousands of years ultimately why we are here and the neanderthals are not can no longer be explained in a way that implies that our existence is particularly meaningful or secure but at least moments like this placed our existence inside some longer continuity it was the day of the brexit vote after from the cave with finlayson i would spend the rest of the afternoon rejiggering my travel plans in a mild panic trying to catch a ride out of gibraltar and into spain that night so that if the spanish exacted a retaliatory after the results were announced i could still make my flight home from malaga the next day i won t describe the scenes i saw that morning the blankness on people s faces at the airport phone calls i overheard except to say that when i woke up on nov 9 after our own election i felt equipped with at least a faint frame of reference reality seemed heightened and a little dangerous because for so many people including me it had broken away from our expectations we had misunderstood the present in the same way archaeologists can misunderstand the past what was possible was suddenly exposed as grossly insufficient because to borrow finlayson s metaphor we never imagined that the few jigsaw puzzle pieces we based it on constituted such a tiny part of the whole even some on the winning sides seemed similarly stunned and adrift many though just felt vindicated later that summer i came across an essay for a british weekly by the actress elizabeth hurley a fervent leave supporter who was now doubling down knock yourselves out calling us neanderthals she wrote and spit a bit more venom and vitriol our way you are showing yourselves in all your meanspirited elitist glory when i read that i took genuine umbrage but on the neanderthals behalf and while i hate to admit it i also felt a cheap but delicious tingle of smugness because i now knew that neanderthal wasn t the insult hurley thought it was though this i simultaneously realized also closed a certain loop and promoted in me the very elitist glory hurley was incensed by thus deepening the divide it was dizzying and sad and maybe inevitably human but still no help to us at all ',\n",

       " 'washington the justice department s inspector general said thursday that he would open a broad investigation into how the f b i director james b comey handled the case over hillary clinton s emails including his decision to discuss it at a news conference and to disclose 11 days before the election that he had new information that could lead him to reopen it the inspector general michael e horowitz will not look into the decision not to prosecute mrs clinton or her aides but he will review actions mr comey took that mrs clinton and many of her supporters believe cost her the election they are the news conference in july at which he announced he was not indicting mrs clinton but described her behavior as extremely careless the letter to congress in late october in which he said that newly discovered emails could potentially change the outcome of the f b i s investigation and the letter three days before the election in which he said that he was closing it again the inspector general s office said that it was initiating the investigation in response to complaints from members of congress and the public about actions by the f b i and the justice department during the campaign that could be seen as politically motivated for mr comey and the agency he heads the clinton investigation was politically fraught from the moment the f b i received a referral in july 2015 to determine whether mrs clinton and her aides had mishandled classified information senior f b i officials believed there was never going to be a good outcome since it put them in the middle of a bitterly partisan issue whatever the decision on whether to charge mrs clinton with a crime mr comey a republican former justice department official appointed by president obama was going to get hammered and he was republicans who made her use of a private email server a centerpiece of their campaign against mrs clinton attacked mr comey after he decided there was not sufficient evidence she had mishandled classified information to prosecute her the clinton campaign believed the f b i investigation was overblown and seriously damaged her chances to win the white house and resented mr comey s comments about mrs clinton at his news conference but the campaign was particularly upset about mr comey s two letters which created a wave of damaging news stories at the end of the campaign when mrs clinton and her supporters thought they had put the email issue behind them in the end the emails that the f b i reviewed which came up during an unrelated inquiry into anthony d weiner the estranged husband of a top clinton aide huma abedin proved irrelevant to the investigation s outcome the clinton campaign said mr comey s actions quite likely caused a significant number of undecided voters to cast ballots for donald j trump f b i officials said thursday that they welcomed the scrutiny in a statement mr comey described mr horowitz as professional and independent and promised to cooperate with his investigation i hope very much he is able to share his conclusions and observations with the public because everyone will benefit from thoughtful evaluation and transparency mr comey said brian fallon the former press secretary for the clinton campaign and the former top spokesman for the justice department said the inspector general s investigation was long overdue this is highly encouraging and to be expected given director comey s drastic deviation from justice department protocol he said a probe of this sort however long it takes to conduct is utterly necessary in order to take the first step to restore the f b i s reputation as a nonpartisan institution mr horowitz has the authority to recommend a criminal investigation if he finds evidence of illegality but there has been no suggestion that mr comey s actions were unlawful rather the question has been whether he acted inappropriately showed bad judgment or violated justice department guidelines it is not clear what the consequences would be for mr comey if he was found to have done any of those things the justice department and the f b i have a longstanding policy against discussing criminal investigations another justice department policy declares that politics should play no role in investigative decisions both democratic and republican administrations have interpreted that policy broadly to prohibit taking any steps that might even hint at an impression of partisanship inspectors general have investigated f b i directors before but rarely the most example was the investigation of william s sessions who was fired by president bill clinton after an internal inquiry cited him for financial misconduct in recent years the inspector general has investigated accusations of wrongdoing by the f b i involving some of its most sensitive operations including a number of surveillance and counterterrorism programs as part of the review the inspector general will examine other issues related to the email investigation that republicans have raised they include whether the deputy director of the f b i andrew g mccabe should have recused himself from any involvement in it in 2015 mr mccabe s wife ran for a state senate seat in virginia as a democrat and accepted nearly 500 000 in political contributions from gov terry mcauliffe a key ally of the clintons though mr mccabe did not assume his post until february 2016 months after his wife was defeated critics both within the agency and outside of it felt that he should have recused himself the f b i has said mr mccabe played no role in his wife s campaign he also told his superiors she was running and sought ethics advice from f b i officials mr horowitz said he would also investigate whether the justice department s top congressional liaison peter kadzik had improperly provided information to the clinton campaign a hacked email posted by wikileaks showed that mr kadzik alerted the campaign about a coming congressional hearing that was likely to raise questions about mrs clinton investigators will be helped in gathering evidence by a law that congress passed just last month which ensures that inspectors general across the government will have access to all relevant agency records in their reviews the law grew out of skirmishes between the f b i and the justice department inspector general over attempts by the f b i to keep grand jury material and other records off limits the new law means mr horowitz s investigators should have access to any records deemed relevant mr trump has not indicated whether he intends to keep mr comey in his job when he cleared mrs clinton of criminal wrongdoing during the campaign mr trump accused him of being part of a rigged system although the president does not need cause to fire the f b i director a critical inspector general report could provide justification to do so if mr trump is looking for some ',\n",

unsubstantiated accounts of frolics with prostitutes real estate deals that were intended as bribes and coordination with russian intelligence of the hacking of democrats were summarized for mr trump in an appendix to a intelligence report the consequences have been incalculable and will play out long past inauguration day word of the summary which was also given to president obama and congressional leaders leaked to cnn tuesday and the rest of the media followed with sensational reports mr trump denounced the unproven claims wednesday as a fabrication a smear concocted by sick people it has further undermined his relationship with the intelligence agencies and cast a shadow over the new administration late wednesday night after speaking with mr trump james r clapper jr the director of national intelligence issued a statement decrying leaks about the matter and saying of mr steele s dossier that the intelligence agencies have not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable mr clapper suggested that intelligence officials had nonetheless shared it to give policy makers the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security parts of the story remain out of reach most critically the basic question of how much if anything in the dossier is true but it is possible to piece together a rough narrative of what led to the current crisis including lingering questions about the ties binding mr trump and his team to russia the episode also offers a glimpse of the hidden side of presidential campaigns involving private looking for the worst they can find about the next american leader the story began in september 2015 when a wealthy republican donor who strongly opposed mr trump put up the money to hire a washington research firm run by former journalists fusion gps to compile a dossier about the real estate magnate s past scandals and weaknesses according to a person familiar with the effort the person described the opposition research work on condition of anonymity citing the volatile nature of the story and the likelihood of future legal disputes the identity of the donor is unclear fusion gps headed by a former wall street journal journalist known for his dogged reporting glenn simpson most often works for business clients but in presidential elections the firm is sometimes hired by candidates party organizations or donors to do political oppo work shorthand for opposition research on the side it is routine work and ordinarily involves creating a big searchable database of public information past news reports documents from lawsuits and other relevant data for months fusion gps gathered the documents and put together the files from mr trump s past in business and entertainment a rich target after mr trump emerged as the presumptive nominee in the spring the republican interest in financing the effort ended but democratic supporters of hillary clinton were very interested and fusion gps kept doing the same deep dives but on behalf of new clients in june the tenor of the effort suddenly changed the washington post reported that the democratic national committee had been hacked apparently by russian government agents and a mysterious figure calling himself guccifer 2 0 began to publish the stolen documents online mr simpson hired mr steele a former british intelligence officer with whom he had worked before mr steele in his early 50s had served undercover in moscow in the early 1990s and later was the top expert on russia at the london headquarters of britain s spy service mi6 when he stepped down in 2009 he started his own commercial intelligence firm orbis business intelligence the former journalist and the former spy according to people who know them had similarly dark views of president vladimir v putin of russia a former k g b officer and the varied tactics he and his intelligence operatives used to smear blackmail or bribe their targets as a former spy who had carried out espionage inside russia mr steele was in no position to travel to moscow to study mr trump s connections there instead he hired native russian speakers to call informants inside russia and made surreptitious contact with his own connections in the country as well mr steele wrote up his findings in a series of memos each a few pages long that he began to deliver to fusion gps in june and continued at least until december by then the election was over and neither mr steele nor mr simpson was being paid by a client but they did not stop what they believed to be very important work mr simpson declined to comment for this article and mr steele did not immediately reply to a request for comment the memos described two different russian operations the first was a yearslong effort to find a way to influence mr trump perhaps because he had contacts with russian oligarchs whom mr putin wanted to keep track of according to mr steele s memos it used an array of familiar tactics the gathering of kompromat compromising material such as alleged tapes of mr trump with prostitutes in a moscow hotel and proposals for business deals attractive to mr trump the goal would probably never have been to make mr trump a knowing agent of russia but to make him a source who might provide information to friendly russian contacts but if mr putin and his agents wanted to entangle mr trump using business deals they did not do it very successfully mr trump has said he has no major properties there though one of his sons said at a real estate conference in 2008 that a lot of money was pouring in from russia the second russian operation described was recent a series of contacts with mr trump s representatives during the campaign in part to discuss the hacking of the democratic national committee and mrs clinton s campaign chairman john d podesta according to mr steele s sources it involved among other things a meeting in prague between michael cohen a lawyer for mr trump and oleg solodukhin a russian official who works for rossotrudnichestvo an organization that promotes russia s interests abroad by all accounts mr steele has an excellent reputation with american and british intelligence colleagues and had done work for the f b i on the investigation of bribery at fifa soccer s global governing body colleagues say he was acutely aware of the danger he and his associates were being fed russian disinformation russian intelligence had mounted a complex hacking operation to damage mrs clinton and a similar operation against mr trump was possible but much of what he was told and passed on to fusion gps was very difficult to check and some of the claims that can be checked seem problematic mr cohen for instance said on twitter on tuesday night that he has never been in prague mr solodukhin his purported russian contact denied in a telephone interview that he had ever met mr cohen or anyone associated with mr trump the on wednesday cited news reports that a different michael cohen with no trump ties may have visited prague and that the two cohens might have been mixed up in mr steele s reports but word of a dossier had begun to spread through political circles rick wilson a republican political operative who was working for a super pac supporting marco rubio said he heard about it in july when an investigative reporter for a major news network called him to ask what he knew by early fall some of mr steele s memos had been given to the f b i which was already investigating mr trump s russian ties and to journalists an mi6 official whose job does not permit him to be quoted by name said that in late summer or early fall mr steele also passed the reports he had prepared on mr trump and russia to british intelligence mr steele was concerned about what he was hearing about mr trump and he thought that the information should not be solely in the hands of people looking to win a political contest after the election the memos still being supplemented by his inquiries became one of washington s secrets as reporters including from the new york times scrambled to confirm or disprove them word also reached capitol hill senator john mccain republican of arizona heard about the dossier and obtained a copy in december from david j kramer a former top state department official who works for the mccain institute at arizona state university mr mccain passed the information to james b comey the f b i director remarkably for washington many reporters for competing news organizations had the salacious and damning memos but they did not leak because their contents could not be confirmed mother jones magazine was an exception publishing a story on oct 31 that described the dossier its origin and significance

from other intelligence sources to their report on the russian cyberattack on the election now after the most contentious of elections americans are divided and confused about what to believe about

at a united steelworkers union hall he said you stopped talking my language you don t care about jobs in an interview ms dockendorff who is running for chairwoman of the state democratic party said rural iowans were critical of democrats for opposing projects like oil pipelines while running a presidential campaign focused narrowly on mr trump s shortcomings it was all about making fun of donald

promised repeatedly to take care of the vets but there was deep skepticism forget about me dan meade a navy veteran said what s going to happen to our kids our grandkids i think the guy s nuts he and three others sipped 1 50 draft beers from plastic cups they sarcastically echoed notable trump lines from the campaign trail he knows more than the generals he doesn t like prisoners of war dan warren an army veteran said when trump was running for office he said he d run the country like he runs his companies fran boyle who served in the navy chimed in which one of his bankrupt companies is he going to run it like still trump voters in the state say they are hoping for the best mike staudt a retired farmer from marble rock voted for mr obama in 2012 but called the affordable care act a form of socialism he said he had no problem with a candidate who had run as the voice of the working people but was stocking his cabinet with the ultrawealthy i know these guys are really rich he said they may have pulled off a few plays that weren t exactly on the but they all had to be pretty smart to be billionaires if they replace their own concerns with the concerns of the country they can make

       " 'on the third day of confirmation hearings on capitol hill there was one emerging theme many of the nominees of donald j trump have disagreements with him on policy there were serious questions efforts at diversion with humor and statements by senators overall though none of the nominees made any major mistakes and one of them james n mattis a retired marine corps general was approved as mr trump s choice for defense secretary by the senate armed services committee 24 to 3 fun fact he doesn t care for the nickname mad dog mr mattis diverged sharply from his prospective boss on russia calling moscow one of the top threats to the world order i m all for engagement mr mattis said but we also have to recognize reality in terms of what russia is up to mr mattis also put daylight between himself and mr trump on nato and indicated strong support for the alliance s principle of collective defense my view is that nations with allies thrive and nations without allies don t mr mattis said mr mattis said he supported the iran nuclear agreement which mr trump has repeatedly criticized and finally he said that he had no intention of revisiting the obama administration s decisions on social issues at the defense department like the opening of combat roles to women representative mike pompeo the kansas republican who is mr trump s nominee for director of the c i a said the agency would pursue information about efforts by russia to interfere with the american election including any possible links to the trump campaign i promise i will pursue the facts wherever they take us he said in a reversal mr pompeo said emphatically that he would not endorse torture including coercive methods like waterboarding mr pompeo had previously said he did not believe waterboarding was torture and that it was legal mr pompeo signaled that he agreed with the assessment of united states intelligence agencies that russian president vladimir v putin of russia tried to promote mr trump s candidacy and to undermine the presidential campaign of hillary clinton describing the report that was delivered last week to mr trump and president obama as sound ben carson s confirmation hearing for secretary of housing and urban development was not attended by mr trump but senator elizabeth warren democrat of massachusetts directed biting comments at the ms warren while accusing mr trump of hiding his assets repeatedly asked mr carson if he would commit to keeping taxpayers dollars away from trump businesses mr carson successfully parried questions about whether someone who had gained acclaim as neurosurgeon was qualified to oversee the vast federal housing agency though he has no background in housing he avoided any major stumbles democrats seemed to take it a bit easy on mr carson with some talking about his young granddaughter attending and others questioning him without being too adversarial ',\n",
       " 'washington ben carson the nominee for secretary of housing and urban development presented himself on thursday as a credible manager for a sprawling federal bureaucracy navigating an unlikely transition from celebrated neurosurgeon and genial conservative presidential candidate to the steward of american housing policy at a senate confirmation hearing mr carson 65 strained at times to square his past remarks on the dangers of federal assistance he once called poverty really more of a choice than anything else with the mission of the department of housing and urban development an agency with a 47 billion budget and a mandate to help millions of renters and struggling homeowners forgoing many specifics he laid out a vision of a more holistic approach recruiting private sector dollars and seeking to end what he called a cycle of generation after generation of people living in dependent situations safety net programs are important i would never advocate abolishing them without having an alternative for people to follow he said adding that some have distorted what i ve said about government yet americans had come to view hud s mission as putting roofs over the heads of poor people mr carson said it has the ability to be so much more than that as with his presidential campaign mr carson leaned heavily on his own compelling biography straying frequently from his prepared opening remarks as he spoke of life in an impoverished section of detroit as the son of a single mother with a education he waded through several contentious moments including some aimed at his prospective boss donald j trump and the specter of conflicts over hud funding and trump family business ventures but mr carson who was prone to fits of spaciness and occasionally bewildering remarks as a candidate appeared to avoid any major slips on thursday the tone of the proceedings diverged sharply from that of hearings this week for rex w tillerson mr trump s choice for secretary of state and senator jeff sessions republican of alabama and the selection for attorney general both men faced aggressive questioning from democrats and in mr tillerson s case from a republican senator marco rubio of florida on thursday mr rubio introduced mr carson as a leader with the values the compassion and the character and the kind of drive that we need senators from both parties made warm reference to mr carson s granddaughter in attendance who wore pink headphones during the testimony they thanked him for his career in medicine even some of the more pointed questioners like senator sherrod brown of ohio the ranking democrat on the committee on banking housing and urban affairs were disarmed you remind me of columbo mr carson said at one point to extended laughs i ve actually heard that before mr brown said still there were sharp exchanges senator elizabeth warren democrat of massachusetts sought to pin mr carson down on a simple question can you assure me that not a single taxpayer dollar that you give out will financially benefit the or his family mr carson said he would be driven by morals ms warren cut him off saying her specific concern was whether grants and loans could specifically benefit mr trump it will not be my intention to do anything to benefit any american mr carson said becoming flustered for a moment before quickly clarifying that he wanted to use the department to help all americans ms warren called on mr trump to establish a blind trust accusing him of hiding his assets mr carson would not commit definitively to avoiding trump businesses if confirmed if there happens to be an extraordinarily good program that s working for millions of people and it turns out that someone that you re targeting is going to gain 10 from it am i going to say no mr carson said later he agreed to work with mr brown to construct a system to identify properties tied both to the trump family and the department he committed to telling senators about the department s dealings with any businesses owned by mr trump or his relatives more often mr carson sat patiently as lawmakers recited some of the most fraught comments of his public life in one interaction senator bob menendez democrat of new jersey asked if mr carson truly believed in hud s mission given his trail of comments railing against government intervention i think the rental assistance program is essential mr carson said when pressed twice and what i have said if you ve been reading my writings it is cruel and unusual punishment to withdraw those programs before you provide an alternative when asked about housing protections for lesbian gay bisexual and transgender citizens mr carson a vocal opponent of marriage said he would enforce all the laws of the land if confirmed but he expressed his personal opposition to any expression of what he called extra rights for certain groups for republicans the hearing supplied an opportunity to pay tribute to a figure revered by the conservative base senator thom tillis republican of north carolina asked mr carson what he thought was the best possible thing we can do for someone on government assistance get them off it mr carson said ',\n",
       " 'well that sure escalated quickly that was donald j trump s inaugural news conference as a duly elected united states in which he called buzzfeed a failing pile of garbage dismissed cnn as fake news and more or less told the whole lot of reporters at trump tower to stuff it when it comes to his unreleased tax returns because everyday americans don t care and anyway i won there were two big lessons in the wednesday morning melee 1 mr trump remains a master media manipulator who used his first news briefing since july to expertly delegitimize the news media and make it the story rather than the chaotic swirl of ethical questions that engulf his transition 2 the news media remains an unwitting accomplice in its own diminishment as it fails to get a handle on how to cover this new and wholly unprecedented president it better figure things out fast because it has found itself at the edge of the cliff and our fingers crossed democracy needs it to stay on the right side of the drop journalists should know this by now trump s gonna trump but it s time for them to take a page from the playbook accept the things they cannot change and then find the courage to change the things they can in the right ways not the wrong ways given mr trump s past behavior there was hardly any doubt that he was going to kneecap his inquisitors on wednesday it s a passion after all if not a strategic imperative but buzzfeed handed him the steel rod hours before with its decision to publish an unvarnished dossier filled with unsubstantiated compromising reports about mr trump allegedly collected by russian agents presumably for blackmail purposes buzzfeed said it was publishing the full document so that americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the that have circulated at the highest levels of the u s government ben smith the buzzfeed editor in chief wrote that we have always erred on the side of publishing and that publishing this dossier reflects how we see the job of reporters in 2017 mr smith s stated rationale highlights the extent to which wikileaks and gawker which is now defunct have changed the nature of journalism both have at times taken a publish first fill in the answers or don t later approach but they held particular outsider roles in the journalistic firmament and both have run into great trouble because of their styles in gawker s case fatally if wrongfully buzzfeed under mr smith has built up a fine traditional news team that has won journalism awards precisely because it succeeded in the ultimate purposes of its craft to establish fact from fiction and enhance its readers understanding of reality that s the opposite of pumping out a bunch of unsubstantiated allegations and then leaving it to readers to make up their own minds about them with no reportorial guidance you can argue that the dossier was going to get out there anyway but it hadn t until buzzfeed published it even though many news organizations including this one had the dossier for months and had they leaked by some other means it would be up to journalists to establish their veracity ignore them if possible debunk them if necessary that s what buzzfeed has done with its reporting on the fake news phenomenon helping to shine an early light on the false stories so many americans were sharing on facebook and other social media platforms throughout the campaign but every journalistic misstep gives more fodder to people who want to stop the efforts against fake news by turning the tables and labeling those efforts or any other solid journalism they don t like as fake news as well corrupting the term for their own purposes a classic case of no you are that s what mr trump did wednesday morning in calling buzzfeed a failing piece of garbage mr trump gave it a cri de coeur but there was collateral damage mr trump s fake news charge against cnn in front of many millions of americans went directly at the network s core purpose as a global news provider cnn drew mr trump s hostility by breaking the news on tuesday that a former british spy had compiled the russia dossier and that intelligence officials included a synopsis of it in briefing materials for the once cnn opened the door buzzfeed followed by publishing the document itself but as cnn pointed out it did not share the details of the memos and it did not even link to the buzzfeed report despite false claims to the contrary by kellyanne conway mr trump s adviser its decision the network said was vastly different than buzzfeed s decision to publish unsubstantiated memos that in turn drew protest from mr smith of buzzfeed who said he was not going to participate in an attempt to divide the media against each other and so mr trump won again by succeeding in doing just that it was all part of a show in which he used news organizations as props in their own lampooning while he played them off each other with labels of good and bad and selectively answered their policy questions a united front would have given the reporters stronger footing but that was woefully lacking when mr trump shouted down jim acosta of cnn who said mr trump s press secretary sean spicer threatened to eject him the other reporters in the room readily took mr acosta s place happy to have their own questions answered but they could be next they re going to have to decide how much they want to abide by mr trump s decision to selectively quarantine colleagues whose coverage he does not like there is some precedent for doing the right thing here from the early days of the obama administration when it questioned fox news s credentials as a news organization that was followed by an attempt by the treasury department to exclude fox news from a round of interviews which the rest of the news media resisted speaking in fox news s defense jake tapper then of abc news publicly criticized the administration for its effort to exclude one of our sister organizations so it was fitting that later on wednesday shepard smith of fox news got behind cnn it is our observation that its correspondents followed journalistic standards and that neither they nor any other journalists should be subjected to belittling and delegitimizing by the of the united states he said on his program the same couldn t be said for his colleague the opinion host sean hannity proudly not a journalist who on wednesday night celebrated the news briefing as the single greatest beatdown of the abusively biased mainstream media in the history of the country mr acosta interestingly made history last spring by becoming the first american journalist to ask a question of a cuban leader raúl castro since the earliest days of the castro regime it was a hopeful sign of a new day for press freedom in the restrictive communist country his with mr trump on the other hand is a bad sign for press freedom at home the news media can t afford a backslide it s going to have to do its part to avoid one ',\n",
       " 'the bar for scandal in the trump administration keeps being raised every week brings potentially damaging developments that in other contexts could have generated weekslong controversies with so many competing stories however they are frequently ignored or forgotten as a result even negative coverage can sometimes benefit donald j trump by displacing potentially more damaging stories from the news agenda for instance many of mr trump s nominees for cabinet positions have faced relatively little scrutiny of their backgrounds or records many failed even to complete background checks before the start of senate hearings a break from decades of precedent or consider the case of monica crowley an incoming national security agency aide found to have engaged in extensive plagiarism in her book which harper collins pulled from the market her ph d dissertation and her washington times column these developments have struggled to gain traction amid the many competing stories about mr trump and his presidential transition including tuesday night s release of unverified allegations against the scandals need time and space to develop when the news cycle is congested potential scandals are deprived of attention causing the media to move on to other stories and the political opposition to anticipate that any criticisms will probably have little effect many observers suspect that mr trump seeks to exploit this dynamic by distracting the press and the public with stunts like meeting with kanye west after delaying a news conference on conflicts of interest or tweeting about meryl streep before hearings to consider his nominees on capitol hill it s impossible to determine his motivations of course but the effect is often to divert attention from less flattering issues on wednesday for instance mr trump s news conference on conflict of interest issues was scheduled on the same day as hearings for six nominees after democrats accused republicans of scheduling the hearings in part to exploit this dynamic and divert the news media s attention some were rescheduled history shows that potential scandals can easily be crowded off the news agenda by other events during the chaotic period for instance the focus on more important events kept army secretary thomas white in office despite numerous questionable decisions the surge in news continued all the way through the invasion of iraq in early 2003 helping to insulate george w bush from fallout over the collapse of the enron corporation and other matters bush didn t suffer a major scandal until valerie plame was outed as a c i a officer that summer another example came during the summer of 2009 when the death of michael jackson helped push the furor over the affair of the south carolina governor mark sanford out of the news by contrast relatively slow news periods may increase the likelihood of a scandal s developing as with the travel habits of former white house chief of staff john h sununu in 1991 which became an issue in the months after the end of the first persian gulf war and as with chris christie s bridgegate scandal in 2014 in an article published in the british journal of political science i provide quantitative evidence suggesting that competition from other news stories can prevent potential scandals from reaching critical mass using data from more than three decades of news media coverage of the president and the executive branch i show that when the incidence of major disasters and tragedies causes an unexpected surge in news coverage the likelihood of a new scandal developing and the intensity of scandal coverage both decrease significantly i find that a similar dynamic appears to apply to governors in this sense the continuing reality show that mr trump creates may help protect him from deep damage by any particular scandal as in the campaign he makes so much news every day that few stories ever generate sustained controversy instead public attention lurches from one story to the next never quite focusing on any particular controversy he may prefer it that way ',\n",

       " 'washington president obama said thursday that he was terminating the policy that has allowed cubans who arrived on united states soil without visas to remain in the country and gain legal residency an unexpected move long sought by the cuban government effective immediately cuban nationals who attempt to enter the united states illegally and do not qualify for humanitarian relief will be subject to removal consistent with u s law and enforcement priorities mr obama said in a statement by taking this step we are treating cuban migrants the same way we treat migrants from other countries the move places a finishing touch on mr obama s efforts as president to end a of hostility between the united states and cuba and to establish normalized relations and diplomatic ties with a government american presidents have long sought to isolate and punish the action came through a new department of homeland security regulation and a deal with the cuban government which mr obama said had agreed to accept the return of its citizens what we ve agreed to is that the past is past and the future will be different said jeh johnson the homeland security secretary this is us repealing a policy unique to cuba given the nature of the relationship 20 years ago which is very different right now the wet foot dry foot policy which dates to 1995 owes its name to its unusual rules which require cubans caught trying to reach the united states by sea to return home yet allow those who make it onto american soil to stay and eventually apply for legal permanent residency it was one way in which the united states tried to weaken fidel castro s government by welcoming tens of thousands of cubans fleeing repression in recent years however it has become a magnet for economic refugees enticing many cubans to make a perilous journey to the united states where they enjoy a status unlike migrants from any other country the exceptionalism of the wet foot dry foot policy toward cuba is a relic of the cold war and this decision by the administration is really its final effort to normalize an area of interaction between cuba and the united states migration that is clearly in need of normalization said peter kornbluh a of back channel to cuba which recounts the secret negotiations between the united states and cuban governments that forged the policy but the change drew sharp criticism from opponents of mr obama s move to thaw united states relations with cuba who argued it would reward dictators in cuba ignoring their human rights abuses today s announcement will only serve to tighten the noose the castro regime continues to have around the neck of its own people senator robert menendez democrat of new jersey said in a statement he said congress had not been consulted on the move and he added the obama administration seeks to pursue engagement with the castro regime at the cost of ignoring the present state of torture and oppression and its systematic curtailment of freedom benjamin j rhodes the deputy national security adviser who led clandestine negotiations that produced the 2014 opening said most cubans who came to the united states in the past absolutely had to leave cuba for political purposes now he said the flow is largely of people seeking greater economic opportunity ending the policy he added is a reflection of mr obama s view that ultimately the rise of a new generation of cubans pressing for change in their own country is vital to bringing about change there it s important that cuba continue to have a young dynamic population that are agents of change mr rhodes said jorge mas the chairman of the cuban american national foundation said the changes would force cuba s leaders to be more responsive to their citizens people may be initially upset at not being able to have this way of getting out of cuba but ultimately the solution for cuba is people fighting for change in cuba mr mas said the change in policy essentially guts the cuban adjustment act of 1966 which assumed that cubans were political refugees who needed protection and allowed those who remained in the united states for more than a year to become legal residents obama administration officials urged congress on thursday to repeal the measure but in the interim by eliminating the policy that automatically afforded parole to cubans arriving in the united states they have essentially denied cuban migrants the opportunity to take advantage of its benefits cuba likewise still has a law in place that denies to migrants once they have been gone for four years or more mr rhodes said officials in havana have pledged to repeal it once the united states congress scraps the cuban adjustment act cubans who believe they will be persecuted if they return home will still be permitted to apply for political asylum when they reach the united states according to the agreement which was signed on thursday in havana the cuban government said it would accept 2 746 people who fled in the mariel boatlift of 1980 back into the country and consider accepting back others on a basis the obama administration also eliminated the cuban medical parole program in which cuban medical professionals stationed in international missions could defect and get visas to the united states obama administration officials had initially said they were not planning to change the policy after efforts to normalize relations with cuba but the thaw prompted speculation that once diplomatic relations resumed as they did in 2015 the arrangement would end on thursday the officials said they had deliberately played down talk of revising the policy for fear of setting off an even larger exodus from the island nation the number of cubans trying to arrive by sea surged after the united states and cuba announced the decision to restore diplomatic relations in 2014 in the 2014 fiscal year almost 4 000 cubans either landed or were caught two years later the number shot up to 7 411 according to the coast guard the number of cubans who have since begun to arrive in the united states by land has also soared in recent years the number of cubans who arrived at the southwest border has increased more than fivefold since 2009 last year almost 55 000 cubans arrived nationwide the department of homeland security said kevin appleby of the center for migration studies of new york praised the specific change while questioning the broader rules covering asylum the good news is that it ensures equal treatment between cubans and from other nations he said the bad news is that our asylum system is broken and does not afford adequate due process and protection to those who need it phil peters president of the cuba research center said that the number of cubans entering the united states is actually much higher because tens of thousands more overstay their visitor visas and still others migrate legally this is a favor to trump because it s a tough measure to take but it s the right measure to take mr peters said these are economic migrants coming here that unlike any other nationality get a big package of government benefits without any justification there was a mixed reaction among cubans in havana to news of the sudden change in policy some said they felt its repeal was long overdue others thought the impact would be widely felt among cubans still hoping to leave their island michel 33 who declined to give his last name for fear of running afoul of the government said he tried to escape on a makeshift boat in the early 2000s but the vessel broke down halfway to the florida keys since then he has given up on his desire to move to the united states but he knows many cubans who still hope to leave and who would be devastated by the change in policy this is going to make a lot of people s lives very hard he said alberto herrero 58 a high school biology teacher applauded the move by the obama administration saying the previous regulation was an unfair law it s unfair to the rest of the world s people especially those in latin america it s exclusive to us and that s not fair to the world he said adding that he hoped the removal of the policy was a signal of a of other outdated measures taken by the americans against cuba maybe other restrictions will be lifted like the embargo he added ',\n",

senators took roll call votes on numerous amendments an arduous exercise known as a the approval of the budget blueprint coming even before donald j trump is inaugurated shows the speed with which republican leaders are moving to fulfill their promise to repeal president obama s signature domestic policy achievement a goal they believe can now be accomplished after mr trump s election the action by the senate is essentially procedural setting the stage for a special kind of legislation called a reconciliation bill such a bill can be used to repeal significant parts of the health law and critically is immune from being filibustered congress appears to be at least weeks away from voting on legislation repealing the law republicans say the 2016 elections gave them a mandate to roll back the health care law the obamacare bridge is collapsing and we re sending in a rescue team said senator michael b enzi republican of wyoming and the chairman of the senate budget committee then we

to repeal and replace the health care law but it is unclear exactly how his team will participate in that effort on wednesday mr trump said he would offer his own plan to repeal and replace the law essentially simultaneously he said he would put forth the plan as soon as his nominee for secretary of health and human services representative tom price republican of georgia is confirmed the

week because of lingering questions over how and when the health care law would be replaced a vote on the measure in the house could come on friday in its lengthy series of votes the senate rejected amendments proposed by democrats that were intended to allow imports of prescription drugs from canada protect rural hospitals and ensure continued access to coverage for people with conditions among other causes in the parlance of capitol hill many of the democrats proposals were messaging amendments intended to put republicans on record as opposing popular provisions of the affordable care act the budget blueprint is for the guidance of congress it is not presented to the president for a signature or veto and does not become law as the senate plowed through its work on wednesday republicans explained why they were determined to dismantle the health care law and they tried to assuage concerns about the future of coverage for millions of americans this is our opportunity to keep our campaign promise said senator roger wicker republican of mississippi this is our opportunity to help the and the vice keep their campaign promises and show to the american people that elections have consequences senator johnny isakson republican of georgia said that while working to repeal the health care law we must also talk about what we replace it with because repealing it without a replacement is an unacceptable solution republicans do not have an agreement even among themselves on the content of legislation to replace the affordable care act the timetable for votes on such legislation or its effective date senator susan collins republican of maine said on wednesday that she agreed with mr trump that congress should repeal the health law and adopt a replacement plan at about the same time but i don t see any possibility of our being able to come up with a comprehensive reform bill that would replace obamacare by the end of this month she said i just don t see that as being feasible ms collins also supported pushing back the deadline to come up with repeal legislation as republicans pursue repealing the law democrats contend that republicans are trying to rip insurance away from millions of americans with no idea of what to do next the senate democratic leader chuck schumer of new york called the republicans repeal plan irresponsible and rushed and urged them to halt their push to unravel the law don t put chaos in place of affordable care he said ',\n",
       " 'as a candidate back in july 2015 donald j trump promised that he would repeal obamacare and replace it with something terrific the senate voted 51 to 48 on thursday morning for a measure setting congress on the path toward repealing president obama s health care law and mr trump is now a few days from taking office the public however knows little more about his proposal than it did in 2015 in comments to the new york times on tuesday and in his news conference on wednesday mr trump described when a republican health reform bill would be released very quickly but he has yet to give details about the policies it would contain we re going to have a health care that is far less expensive and far better he said wednesday mr trump accurately describes problems with the current health care system for americans under 65 you have deductibles that are so high that after people go broke paying their premiums which are going through the roof the health care can t even be used by them because their deductibles bills are so high mitch mcconnell the senate majority leader and house speaker paul ryan have also spoken forcefully in recent days about how health care is too expensive premiums for health insurance plans in the united states are high and increasing deductibles can make needed coverage a financial stretch even for the insured recent polling from the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation suggests that the public agrees with mr trump s assessment high spending on health care is americans no 1 health care concern mr trump has promised that he will not make major changes to medicare the program for americans 65 and older but solving those problems is not as easy as identifying them the real reason health care premiums and deductibles are so high is that medical care is very expensive in the united states far more costly than it is anywhere else in the world the united states pays very high prices to doctors and hospitals and drug and device makers and americans use a lot of that expensive medical care that means that the country spent far more on health care than its peers even when tens of millions of americans lacked health coverage obamacare has been successful in getting health insurance to people who lacked it before about 20 million more americans had insurance last year than before the law passed according to an obama administration estimate but the health law largely focused on health insurance regulation did not drive down the cost of medical treatments health care and health insurance continues to be expensive that means that a republican health reform plan that is both cheaper and better than obamacare will be hard to deliver republicans in congress and think tanks have put together a number of possible obamacare replacement plans they are all slightly different and it is unclear which one mr trump and congressional leaders will choose but none of them solve both sides of the less expensive and far better equation most of the g o p plans manage to be less expensive for the federal government by offering stingier federal payments in helping people buy insurance and allowing the coverage people buy to be skimpier but those proposals will tend to increase not decrease the amount many americans spend on their health care people will end up paying a larger share of their income to buy coverage than they do under obamacare deductibles and other forms of spending capped under obamacare will tend to rise in many plans millions to tens of millions fewer americans will have coverage under such plans according to independent estimates republicans also want to pare back the minimum package of benefits that plans must cover which will drive up costs substantially for some patients while reducing them for others if the bill eliminates requirements to pay for maternity care or prescription drugs for example that could lower the sticker price of a health plan but will make health care much more expensive for anyone who has a baby or takes medication there will be people who will be better off under a republican plan healthy people who buy their own insurance have been the most disadvantaged group under obamacare and their fortunes would improve the republican plans with their skimpier benefits and more generous tax assistance for the wealthy would offer them a better deal the g o p plans tend to be worse for people who need insurance and are poor or have major health problems some sick people may be far worse off mr trump has promised that people with health conditions will be covered under his plan but not all the republican plans offer them the kind of coverage that they can get under obamacare the affordable care act is a case study in these most of the things its creators did to try to make health insurance far better like requiring minimum benefits or banning lifetime coverage limits also made it more expensive the things they did to make insurance less expensive like encouraging higher deductibles or requiring all americans to buy health insurance or pay a fine are top talking points the consensus democratic approach to making obamacare far better has been to make it more expensive for the federal government but less expensive for individuals proposals circulated by president obama and hillary clinton would involve more federal spending on subsidies to help make insurance more affordable for more people but at the expense of higher taxes so far the republican plans have tended to engage in the same but tilt in the opposite direction emphasizing government savings over program generosity the recent statements from mr trump suggest that the coming replacement plan promised in the next few weeks will be able to achieve both goals simultaneously mr trump has provided almost no detail about what will be in it ',\n",
       " 'the season 7 real housewives of new jersey reunion show took place in october in a theater in westbury n y an elaborate thing had been constructed on a stage that would soon seat the five housewives complete with a rug and zebra chairs everything sparkling everything the set was erected so specifically and thoroughly that it included a kitchen in the back unusable but complete that you could see only a fraction of and a fireplace that the cameras would never pick up that s not a real fireplace i asked a production assistant who answered it s not not real the five contracted housewives arrived on long island the night before for this reckoning of the season s tensions equal parts state of the state panel discussion and of every lunchtime confrontation that occurred at my high school the housewives were shuttled in black s u v s under the cover of darkness to a hotel more than two hours from where they live in order to throw off the scent to the press a publicist told me though scent is a strange word choice here because anyone with a nose could have the place from the sheer concentration of applied shalimar but there was good reason for the secrecy leaks from these reunion shows have been rampant and after a previous one andy cohen the mediator and the franchise creator or as he says the person who gets credit for creating the franchise when really a lot of other people were involved realized that the leaks might be coming from the hair and makeup teams who watch the live feed from a holding room he told the producers to cut the audio to those dressing rooms since then the integrity of his reunion show if again integrity is the right word to describe the absolute ravaging of women by their former current and future friends accusing one another of everything from having had more than their admitted amount of plastic surgery to being an actual f b i snitch has been intact the only leaks would be coming from cohen and they d come when he decided they would come cohen prepared himself in a sunny makeshift dressing room on the first floor standing shirtless as he tried to choose a tie for the yes that s taping his voice was a hoarse whisper stubbornly projected through sheer will from deep behind his sternum he had just come from disseminating his andyness throughout the country on a speaking tour with his friend anderson cooper in which both men told stories from their personal lives and drank fresquilas on stage there were a few appearances for his coming book tour for superficial more adventures from the andy cohen diaries he had been talking for hours on his weekly radio shows plural as well as negotiating and announcing his new book imprint andy cohen books he had been hosting his nightly live talk show on bravo watch what happens live with andy cohen and of course he continued to the real housewives franchise watching cuts of each episode for all seven cities giving notes hiring firing reconsidering and fielding text messages from the stars of those shows sometimes replying purely with emoji i told him that the housewives who were waiting for the taping to begin seemed nervous a lot of them view me as kind of their daddy in some weird sick way and their boss and their friend and their boyfriend and their enemy and so there s a lot of different psychological layers happening in a situation like this he replied some of them are volatile women so it s all real it s all real below the street in their dressing rooms the housewives breathed through the tension they had lived their reality on camera and watched the results they had heard their housewife colleagues talk about their behavior in interviews and they had built within themselves a caldron of anger resentment and oh yeah s to what they had seen so as not to dilute their fury so as not to lose one moment of heat for the cameras the publicists brought them to me separately through secured hallways like hannibal lecter on his gurney teresa giudice who wore a satin evening gown and body shimmer it was 8 a m told me she used to be nervous about confronting certain cast members at these reunions but now since serving a prison term for fraud in 2015 which she continually refers to as the time i went away she s fine she s ready for her day in court or whatever this is for her she used to resent cohen because she thought he was hardest on her but now she takes a more nuanced view i think he s an amazing guy she said if he was straight i definitely would date him jacqueline laurita who was teresa s best friend but has now replaced melissa gorga as teresa s sworn enemy for life admitted that she was expecting a blood bath yeah it feels like you re walking to the electric chair is how she put it she knew she would be held accountable for crimes that included calling teresa a criminal and accusing teresa s allies of being her soldiers jacqueline knew she just had to endure it she has stopped trying to game cohen at these things he greets you with a smile and he has a way about him and he makes you feel comfortable talking about things and he can pull the best and the worst out of you with a smile on his face she agreed that the best way to think of cohen is the way you think of jesus you pray to him for blessings to get more airtime to get a rival off the show but like jesus himself he answers prayers only sometimes in his sunny dressing room up above i asked cohen how he d feel if like the housewives he were about to be confronted by everyone he d interacted with this year i m not on a reality show about my life was his answer it annoys him this implication that what he s doing is somehow cruel to the women who have signed up for it but don t you feel bad for them i wanted to know he shook his head the way he would every time i didn t get it these women who were once housewives real housewives are now businesswomen teresa giudice is a new york times author melissa gorga has a successful clothing store jacqueline laurita now has a platform to talk about her son s autism and for her husband to sell a brand called the little kernel i m in a business relationship with these women he said they know what they re doing he put on his shirt and picked the striped tie walking out he was intercepted by kathleen french a senior vice president at bravo who said that things had become a little too crazy the night before at the end of the real housewives of orange county trip to ireland don t tell me any more he said let me just see it he took his place in the fake living room and sat down very casual he said as the women out in their restrictive formal wear a deep mustard and hair spritzed to within an inch of laws this is their super bowl he told me when i asked why they were in tie before 8 a m over the next few hours as they said things like oh really bitch and i was friends with teresa when she was chasing a prostitution whore out of a country club and do i look like an ape and i m turning you off and you re a dumb bitch cohen s placid cool sometimes gave way to frustration stay on your couches he beseeched them don t push daddy he put a finger gun to his head as teresa accused jacqueline of selling a story to a tabloid he won t like that i began this article with the housewives cohen has hosted a nightly talk show now for more than seven years that features scintillating conversation with celebrities and o k yes clips of bravo shows but his guests are legitimate stars like meryl streep and oprah winfrey and o k yes real housewives watch what happens live is doing well with nearly 800 000 viewers a night the set just expanded to accommodate twice its audience but you can t talk about cohen without talking about the empire that he helped create in 2006 a juggernaut of unscripted television with all but one of the locales it s dallas averaging two or three million viewers per episode real housewives is watched sincerely it is watched as camp it is it is it is it is pored over by at least one very funny podcast bitch sesh it is debated by feminists it is singled out for a particular kind of cultural degradation that has seeped into our national conversation and it is fairly said to have been a factor in our recent elevation of a host to the highest office of this country a man who apparently spent thanksgiving asking his guests style whom he should pick for secretary of state cohen was at a jewish federation speaking gig in washington recently when a man raised his hand and asked if he felt responsible for the level of discourse that the american republic had descended to in the last few months it was two weeks before the election and the question was fair over the 10 million episodes of real housewives i watched this fall i heard people say to one another i just wanna friggin rip his balls off and put away your penis and maybe someone would treat you like a woman i saw a woman flip a table when she was angry a woman who threw her fake leg when she was angry more on this later i saw women demand respect respect respect saying you don t respect me and that is not respect and that s disrespectful respect in the way that people who conduct themselves respectfully and respectably seldom feel the need to demand out loud over in the presidential debates meanwhile hillary clinton was called a nasty woman and donald trump s twitter feed seemed as if it had been ghostwritten by kelly dodd the real housewife of orange county responsible for such twitter pronouncements as got my phone hacked with the fraud dept going to get a private investigator and i m going to sue press charges good luck thunderdome but cohen told that man in washington this first of all the housewives are entertainment second of all in the housewives universe you get punished for behaving badly there are consequences to it the consequences to donald trump s behavior by contrast seemed to be more people loving him had he seen the polls i asked he had made a similar speech to me and i was skeptical trump s not going to win i told him cohen pursed his lips and raised his eyebrows and tilted his head back and forth in consideration you never know i didn t listen to him no one did not even when he conducted two televised and dubiously scientific polls of the people who tuned into watch what happens live and turned up numbers based on about 60 000 votes that said actually yes trump was going to win he s used to that there s a lot of times when i will say something about politics and people will immediately discount me and i think it s the easiest way to discount my show too it s just like oh that s the housewives guy who cares cohen explained a few weeks after the reunion we were at cafe cluny in the west village for lunch in the 3 p m hour which is the approximate time lunch happens for someone who goes to bed at about 2 a m each night often following a massage he ordered a salad and then stared down the three pieces of dark chocolate that came with the check i think i m about it but on the other hand if that s what i am i m also good with it because it s a wonderful thing to be his voice didn t get less hoarse over the months i spent with him you know what i mean he opened his mouth to say something else only to remember that control in an interview resides with the person who can stop talking look i was a thinking person before the housewives ever came he took a piece of the chocolate i ve been a tv producer for a long time not that that s mensa but i ve had a career and i made my own way so i just think if i ever say something that someone doesn t want to hear it s a very easy thing to then say oh well coming from the housewives guy oh really mr real housewives he is lately at 48 consumed with trying to gauge exactly where he stands in the national esteem when i first met him in his downtown office a few minutes before he went on the air he asked me why i wanted to do an article on him i m just not that introspective he said i took this to mean he possessed the natural discomfort that a producer might have with someone else telling his story but soon i realized it was more about positioning do we think of him as the housewives guy or as a former bravo head of development who has a thriving production company or a guy with his own channel on sirius xm radio that features shows with sandra bernhard and dan rather or the author of three books or the host of a nightly talk show the first one in late night with a working bar no matter what james corden says he is no longer what he started out as on the talk show the kind of person who could ask the question we wanted answered like jacqueline why would you sit on that woman s lap after she threatened to rage on your ass now he s one of the famous people and so he is these days often trying to figure out a metric by which he can ascertain where he falls in the fame food chain in superficial there s a diary entry in which he talks about getting a invitation from his good friend sarah jessica parker to be her date for the met gala so that s data but he goes to ralph lauren to get a tux for the event and the one he likes is being held for bobby cannavale and he spends a little time trying to process that he doesn t have more pull than bobby cannavale another tux he likes is being held for johnny depp which is o k with him because of course johnny depp it didn t piss me off he insisted when i asked about the incident and his calculations surrounding it no i was like oh o k oh good here s a ranking and now i know where i stand they re telling me where i stand i m finding out how this works he paused for a second i m just psyched that i m getting a tux o k maybe it did sting a little when vanity fair had an article devoted to the hosts of late night and cohen seemed to be the only one excluded from it trevor noah hadn t even made his debut yet but again this is just data everything s good he insisted i have my health i have my show i have my life you know what i mean but also i think my show is a late show you know don t read any of this as defeated or bitter if there s one thing about cohen it s that his respect for the democratic rhythms of popular culture and popularity in general is total he wants to watch the rise and fall of things even himself without trying to manipulate the process he wants it all to play out the people will decide and watching what the people decide and how they decide is far more important than the decision itself from a young age there was something about andy cohen that his mother couldn t quite put her finger on they would watch all my children together during the era which she wondered if maybe other sons weren t doing with their mothers he had a diana ross poster on his wall what was it though what was it then one day she was watching him prance her word across the stage in his high school s performance of carousel and a notion crept in and took hold she got home that night and looked under his bed where she found a healthy stash of gay porn now she was sure something was going on but what she spoke with a psychologist she knew who understood gay issues because he had a gay relative and that psychologist told her that maybe she should stop looking under his bed andy was about to leave for college for boston university and the psychologist said b u is a good place for him to go for that he ll meet a lot of other gay people and now his mother really began to suspect something was up a few years later cohen wrote a letter to a friend that he left on his parents kitchen table and his mother read it and sat him down and asked him if he was sure and he told her he was a mother always knows he knew he wanted to be onscreen even in high school but he didn t want to play characters he wanted to be famous for being himself but at the time that idea didn t truly exist yet outside the news and shows like oprah and donahue i liked the idea of being myself in front of the camera so just me being me i used to think if i could work on a morning show then i could be me he got a job as an intern at cbs news then as a producer there but he started to burn out after 10 years after a run at the barry diller cable network trio he landed at bravo where he helped develop breakout successes like top chef and the millionaire matchmaker lauren zalaznick at the time president of bravo recalls someone coming in with hundreds of hours of documentary tape from a gated community in orange county calif which the producers needed to work in that footage cohen saw something i don t want to pretend like it was like lightning in a bottle at the beginning he said i was like this is a soap opera this is a soap opera u2009 it was also something else this is real life right before the first season aired in 2006 he had a minor crisis over the opening credits the housewives shows usually begin with an introduction of each housewife posing in grade a evening wear and announcing her tagline which is part defensive apologia part mission statement part brand definition but at the beginning when they were editing the first season of orange county they went with sound bites from the show like i don t wanna get old and percent of the women around here have had breast implants and are the police involved when cohen saw the first cut he ran to the office of shari levine bravo s vice president of production and told her she had to call the production company the housewives were going to think the producers were sabotaging them but levine told him the housewives had already seen it and they loved it cohen learned that day that people stand behind their behavior and that trying to protect them from themselves is a fundamental act of disrespect these women but maybe all women i mean maybe all men too i think all people want to be heard and understood he learned too that people don t need you to fight their battles that they are entitled to them even if you think they re ridiculous he learned that an audience will respond to however eccentric or stubborn or mean or dumb or kind a person is if that person is being authentic the things that you think might embarrass them they actually feel like well i was standing up for myself he said i eventually watched the episode of real housewives of orange county that kathleen french had warned cohen about it was part of a arc in which the women go to ireland so that one of them meghan can track down her ancestors this is manifested as her actually tapping people on the shoulder in the street and asking if they are related to her now orange county which is the screechiest housewives franchise had experienced so far a year of immense healing with the housewives working on forgiveness that went right out the window on this trip kelly whom i mentioned earlier is someone prone to saying things like what comes before part b she also does the old what s on your shirt and when you look down she flicks you in the nose well it was one such flick which she administered to vicki that plunged the whole trip into darkness kelly wanted to know why heather was so uptight about it since jews are supposed to have a good sense of humor heather called kelly racist and kelly of course said i m not being racist i m mexican eventually tamra got involved and kelly said no wonder why her daughter isn t talking to her which prompted tamra to lunge for kelly and curse and hit her and they were all kicked out of the department store they were in something cohen knows a belief that began to take root in him back when he was watching all my children with his mother was that people who interacted would always create something interesting that s why he doesn t understand why anyone would think that real housewives wasn t real in some way or that it was too crass had people been on a subway recently had they read an online comments section if anyone was under the impression that we were still in a jane austen novel in terms of national discourse and manners it wasn t cohen s fault that they were in for a rude awakening it s all real it wouldn t be compelling to watch if it weren t teresa giudice was having a real breakdown when she flipped that table in new jersey but in new york when aviva drescher got angry and threw her prosthetic leg at le cirque of all places in a effort to make her onscreen presence more interesting well that was the last we saw of aviva it is very real to them he said and by the way when it s not they re off the show a few months after the women from orange county returned from ireland and watched the episodes through holes between their fingers they pulled themselves together for the reunion they put on clothing appropriate for christmas dinner at the white house if it were cinderella s gathered on two separate couches with andy in the middle folded their hands in their laps and apologized to one another a few days after the election cohen began book promotion for superficial he started with a few local appearances including one at the 92nd street y where he was interviewed onstage by sarah jessica parker he had spent election night at her house actually and as soon as it became clear who the winner was cohen left the room to eat a few days later his optimism had mostly returned anderson cooper told me when we met in st louis i think oprah said to andy you carry the light when i heard that i was like that s really true onstage at the y he had already come around enough to say that he thinks that at heart donald trump is a democrat the liberal largely jewish crowd who had been reading about the terrifying increase of hate crimes since the election and had begun to feel as if the world were closing in faster than they d expected responded with silence we met at cafe cluny again a week later and i asked him if he had noticed the silence he said he didn t get it he wanted to know why everyone he knew was so surprised about all of this i d been watching the show hadn t i i d seen tamra from orange county call alexis jesus jugs hadn t i how was that different from calling hillary clinton crooked hillary i d watched in the primaries as trump defended the size of his penis right wouldn t that be the province of the housewives if they were men he was right trump was not not like one of cohen s housewives he knew he had to be entertaining to stay on the show he was willing to say anything to get his contract extended throughout his campaign he pulled out the i know something but i m not going to say it now trick most recently employed by bethenny frankel about dirt she has but won t reveal about both dorinda and jules at the last new york reunion at the debates the candidates fought for time to speak and demanded that they be allowed the time they were promised which is what happens at the reunions when cohen saw that he told me he thought lester holt i feel your pain anderson cooper was a moderator of a debate in st louis that ended with the candidates saying something nice about each other which is exactly how cohen ends some real housewives reunions it was one thing when people were copying his format for a talk show and pretending it was theirs but now life is copying his format and he s still not quite getting credit for it just blame but isn t that always the way for cohen he s confronted from the audience he s confronted by that guy in washington and still he s not getting the credit for what his gift actually is which isn t knowing how to deviously propel national discourse into the gutter but instead delivering to viewers what they want before they know they want it and still they mess up the name of his show calling it watch what happens now they accuse him of ruining america when he carries the light even oprah said it andy cohen didn t invent our society to think that is to have missed the entire point of him he simply predicted it he saw it coming before we did and he taped it he has a lack of judgment about the way the world works and therefore doesn t have the willful ignorance that the rest of us do yes we d seen tamra call alexis jesus jugs and we insisted it was a tacky anomaly but it wasn t it was the way the world works now andy cohen isn t how our culture got this way he is simply a walking seismograph of it back at cafe cluny i took one of the pieces of chocolate that came with the check he left the other two alone i asked him what was going to happen next he shrugged and opened his mouth to say something pausing for what felt like a minute then he told me that it was all going to be o k and i decided to believe him ',\n",
       " 'working out only on the weekends or otherwise compressing your total physical activity into one or two prolonged runs or a single vigorous basketball or soccer game each week could lessen your risks of dying prematurely almost as effectively as more frequent shorter workouts spread throughout the week according to an interesting new study of the weekend warrior phenomenon as most of us have heard by now the standard recommendation about how much exercise we should complete each week for health purposes is 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity moderate exercise consists of activities like brisk walking or easy cycling that raise heart rates while still allowing us to talk to training partners and vigorous activities are those like running cycling and many team sports including basketball and soccer that raise heart rates into a zone where speaking is difficult meeting these guidelines is associated with a substantially reduced risk of developing a wide range of diseases and dying too young the guidelines also suggest that for practical purposes people consider breaking the 150 minutes into five moderate sessions each week or a comparable number of shorter more vigorous workouts but many people apparently do not have the time or inclination to exercise five times per week about a third of american adults engage in zero weekly exercise and others pack their workouts into one or two sessions on saturday or sunday when they have more free time there has been little information though about whether the weekend warrior pattern of exercise lowers the risk for premature death as effectively as more frequent and generally shorter workouts so for the new study which was published on monday in jama internal medicine researchers at loughborough university in england and other institutions decided to delve into the exercise routines of tens of thousands of men and women already participating in the health survey for england and the scottish health survey the researchers zeroed in on data from 63 591 men and women who had provided detailed descriptions of their workout patterns when they first entered the study at least 15 years before telling the survey questioners how many minutes they had exercised each week during the past month what kinds of exercise they had undertaken and how many times per week they had worked out the researchers used that data to categorize the men and women into a variety of groups those who never exercised were defined unsurprisingly as inactive while those who worked out but did not meet the standard guidelines were considered insufficiently active those who did exercise for the full 150 gentle or 75 vigorous weekly minutes were labeled sufficiently active this last group was then subdivided into those who spread their physical activity over at least three sessions and those who jammed it into one or two workouts presumably on weekends although the actual days were not specified interestingly these weekend warriors were mostly male almost half exercised only once per week and an overwhelming majority almost 90 percent reported that their exercise occurred during vigorous sports like competitive running and cycling or team sports like soccer finally the researchers crosschecked their participants against death registries to determine mortality in the intervening years since each person had joined the original survey it turned out that exercise in any amount had substantially lessened the risk that someone would die from any cause including heart disease and cancer men and women who exercised even if they did not meet the guideline recommendations were about 29 percent less likely to die prematurely than people who never worked out those who met the recommendations gained a slight edge in longevity being about 30 percent less likely to have died than people who never exercised this advantage remained about the same whether people worked out three or more times during the week or jammed all of their activity into a session or two reductions in risk were similar in the weekend warriors and the regularly active says gary o donovan a research associate at loughborough university who led the study of course this study was observational so it can t tell us whether exercise actually caused people to live longer but only that the two are associated it also raises questions it cannot answer including whether weekend warriors might be missing out on other potential health gains from exercise frequent exercise is generally thought to be better than fewer workouts at for instance preventing and controlling type 2 diabetes says hannah arem an epidemiologist at george washington university who wrote a commentary to accompany the new study weekend warriors also could be losing aerobic fitness between workouts since endurance capacity typically declines after a or layoff so weekend warriors might be rebuilding and maintaining but

       " 'seoul south korea when the south korean artist hong produced a painting that depicted president park as a scarecrow manipulated by evil forces including her dictator father her senior aides discussed how to punish mr hong according to a diary one of them kept soon after the painting s completion in august 2014 the retaliation began as planned in the aide s diary which surfaced in november in the investigation into the corruption scandal that has led to ms park s impeachment trial first a civic group sued mr hong on charges of defaming ms park then his work was excluded from the gwangju biennale south korea s international arts festival an act gwangju s mayor later admitted was due to government pressure the retaliation did not stop there mr hong said dozens of conservative activists showed up in front of my apartment like a goon squad shaking my photographs and calling me a communist painter he said i received death threats on the phone as it turned out mr hong was one of thousands of artists reportedly blacklisted by the government of ms park whose powers have been suspended as she faces an impeachment trial on charges of corruption and abuse of power the blacklist is just one element in the sprawling case that has infuriated the public and prompted national introspection about south korea s young democracy and its authoritarian past on thursday three of ms park s former aides including one of her former culture ministers kim were arrested on charges of blacklisting cultural figures deemed unfriendly and barring them from support programs so far two versions of the blacklist have been reported by the news media citing anonymous sources officials including the special prosecutor in the case park have confirmed the existence of the blacklist but have not released it a 2015 version of the list included more than 9 000 people according to news reports the list contained some of south korea s most beloved filmmakers actors and writers including the director of oldboy park and the snowpiercer actor song officially ms park has made promoting movies and other cultural products one of her key priorities but secretly her government has blackballed artists reviving a practice of past military dictators like her father park and in so doing has seriously undermined the freedom of thought and expression the special prosecutor s office said the revelations about the cultural blacklist added a new layer of notoriety to the scandal surrounding ms park and prosecutors planned to use the list to help strengthen the impeachment charges against her when the national assembly voted to impeach ms park last month it accused her of conspiring with her longtime confidante choi to solicit bribes from businesses and crack down on uncooperative officials and journalists the special prosecutor is investigating whether ms park and kim her former chief of staff who was depicted as one of the dark forces in mr hong s painting were involved in the blacklisting of artists both ms park and mr kim her former chief of staff have denied involvement however another of ms park s former culture ministers yoo said the list was dictated by the president s office on monday the current culture minister cho said i understand how pained artists must have felt when excluded from government support just because of their political and ideological beliefs for many south koreans news of the blacklisting of artists reawakened memories from the nation s dictatorial past ms park s father who ruled south korea from 1961 to 1979 censored newspapers and imprisoned dissident writers and publishers chun a military dictator during the 1980s banished a comedian from tv after people compared the appearances of the two men both were bald subsequent governments were accused of favoring scholars and civic groups when doling out research projects and subsidies under ms park s conservative predecessor lee some celebrities and journalists deemed progressive were barred from broadcasters but the latest revelations marked the first time the existence of an extensive government blacklist was revealed since south korea moved toward democracy in the late 1980s it s an honor to be on the list ko un one of south korea s poets told the broadcaster sbs last month when it reported on another version of the list this shows how disgusting the government is under ms park whose leadership style is often compared to her father s rumors of a blacklist have been circulating for years the rumors intensified after two theatrical directors were mysteriously booted from government subsidy programs one had campaigned for ms park s main opponent in the 2012 election another had produced a play spoofing ms park and her father and after the organizers of the busan international film festival screened a documentary that delved into what it called ms park s botched response to the sewol ferry disaster in 2014 in which more than 300 people died the festival lost half of its government funding mr yoo the former culture minister said mr kim ms park s chief of staff at the time began ordering the culture ministry to blacklist certain artists in 2013 last month a former aide to ms park was indicted on charges of colluding with her in an attempt to blackmail a vice chairwoman of cj which runs south korea s biggest film studio into retiring in 2013 the company had angered ms park s office by financing a movie about her ideological enemy the former president roh mr yoo said in a radio interview last month i thought this kind of thing happened only under the past military rule cj s chairman sohn told a parliamentary hearing last month mr yoo said that an early version of the blacklist he saw in june 2014 included hundreds of artists shortly before he was replaced a month later mr yoo said he met ms park to warn against the list ms park has denied being warned by 2015 the list had ballooned to include more than 9 000 visual artists musicians actors film and musical directors and writers deemed critical of ms park particularly those who took aim at her handling of the ferry disaster or who were suspected of supporting her rivals according to the hankook ilbo newspaper which published what it claimed was the list in october ms park s office zealously pursued her opponents after the ferry disaster according to the diary of kim the former presidential aide who detailed the retaliation against mr hong the ferry tragedy is a central motif in mr hong s painting during a meeting of senior presidential aides in 2014 mr kim ms park s chief of staff at the time called for a combative response to leftists in the cultural and art circles and ordered the aides to discover their networks according to the diary he compared progressive teachers and journalists to poisonous mushrooms the diary also recorded instructions to punish artists who satirized ms park conduct a loyalty check of senior government officials intimidate courts of law and induce scholars to write newspaper columns make them afraid to challenge the president mr kim was quoted as saying in a diary entry dated july 4 2014 he has denied giving such an order and said that the diary did not faithfully record what was actually discussed during the aides meetings the author of the diary kim died in august but prosecutors said they found it useful in building their case against ms park mr hong the painter said that for poor artists being cut off from travel and other government support programs could be crushing in 2015 mr hong was invited to show his painting at a berlin arts festival but no domestic logistics company would transport the work for fear of government retaliation mr hong had to travel alone and hurriedly repaint a copy of the original in berlin he also suspected the government was behind a tax audit of his wife s clinic last year it makes me shudder that park and her cronies tried to tame artists by holding back a pittance of government support while they themselves pocket millions mr hong said they showed how depraved political power can be ',\n",
       " 'baltimore nearly two years after the death of a black man in police custody led to violent riots here the justice department and city leaders announced on thursday a agreement to impose greater oversight and training on a police force found to have routinely harassed minorities negotiators have been rushing for weeks to complete the deal before the jan 20 inauguration of donald j trump and the expected confirmation of his attorney general pick senator jeff sessions both men are seen as hostile to police oversight agreements like the one put in place on thursday with mr trump denouncing what he called the war on police during his presidential campaign justice department negotiators are moving quickly to complete a second investigation in chicago which has also been wracked by violence and tension between the police and residents the findings of that investigation could come as early as friday announcing the baltimore deal at city hall attorney general loretta e lynch said she was confident that the reforms mandated by the deal would take hold even if the trump administration were to take steps to try to undo it this agreement is binding and it will live on said ms lynch flanked by mayor catherine pugh police commissioner kevin davis vanita gupta the head of the civil rights division at the justice department and others mr davis said the pact provides a path forward that he said will benefit both his officers and the city s residents and that it should serve as a model for thousands of other police departments in tackling tensions baltimore came under justice department scrutiny after an man freddie gray 25 died of a spinal cord injury he received while in police custody in 2015 as he was being transported in a department van the death led to widespread protests gov larry hogan a republican called in the national guard to quell riots and appeals for federal intervention in the ensuing political fallout the democratic mayor stephanie dismissed the police chief and six officers were charged in mr gray s death none were convicted the episode roiled racial tensions nationwide amid a string of other deaths of black men in police confrontations nationwide from ferguson mo to staten island the justice department filed a consent decree in federal court on thursday just minutes before announcing the deal a judge must approve it before the city and the police department begin putting in place more than a dozen changes including improved training and technology community oversight and greater transparency in dealings between the police and the public once that is done the crucial first step will almost surely fall to the trump administration working with the city to recommend an outside independent monitor to determine whether baltimore is adequately taking steps to address what a blistering justice department report in august found was systemic racial bias in its policing ms pugh a democrat who has been in office 33 days recounted hectic 1 30 a m phone calls with negotiators in the weeks leading up to the agreement she called the results a great day for baltimore she made clear what she considered the most important element training training training training the agreement requires officers to go through 80 hours of training in practices like community policing and proper tactics for stops searches and arrests another measure will require improved safety technology and video cameras inside police vans like the one used to transport mr gray when he died the justice department s report on city policing last year found that officers routinely stopped large numbers of people in poor black neighborhoods for dubious reasons and arrested residents merely for speaking out in ways police officers deemed disrespectful in baltimore a city that is 63 percent black the report found that 91 percent of those arrested on discretionary offenses like failure to obey or trespassing were blacks made up 60 percent of baltimore s drivers but accounted for 82 percent of traffic stops of the 410 pedestrians who were stopped at least 10 times in the five and a half years of data reviewed 95 percent were black the findings also painted a picture of a police culture deeply dismissive of sexual assault victims and hostile toward prostitutes and transgender people the decree s requirements are intended to prohibit unlawful stops and arrests and to prevent discriminatory policing and excessive force representative elijah cummings a maryland democrat called the agreement a chance to trust between residents and the police after a painful few years deray mckesson a voice in the black lives matter movement who lives in baltimore said he was impressed by the decree s wide range it is the first consent decree that i have seen that addresses the police department s internal affairs division mr mckesson said by text message and goes further to ensure that officers are not targeting poor citizens or citizens in historically areas and addresses the response to citizens in crisis or with mental health challenges provisions of the decree prohibit the police from stopping people based solely on where they are or how they respond to the presence of a police officer the supreme court has ruled that officers can stop a person who flees from them in neighborhoods this starts to push back on that line and says look we re really reinforcing that people have a right to avoid contact with the police and the place they live shouldn t be an important factor in how much fourth amendment protection they get said david jaros an associate professor of law at the university of baltimore but at the same time mr jaros added it s ambiguous as to what its reach is and whether it limits police actions further than existing law does tessa the president of baltimore s branch of the n a a c p said she was heartened to see that the police department had already implemented reforms like testing body cameras and changing aspects of prisoner transport and hoped the consent decree would bring more but tawanda jones the sister of tyrone west who died in 2013 after a struggle with the police said the rush to finish the deal and the coming handover of power in washington had eroded her faith that the decree would bring about meaningful change in baltimore what does a piece of paper mean it means nothing ms jones said it s not a training issue it s a system that is broke it s a system that doesn t hold people accountable ',\n",

didn t select her novel love and treasure as one of its 100 notable books of 2014 she unleashed a tweetstorm of hurt excerpt there are many books on that notable list with reviews that were nowhere near as good as mine when she announced in a 2005 essay that she loved her husband the novelist michael chabon more than she loved her children outraged mothers everywhere clucked and and when she expressed surprise the chorus came back well what on earth did you expect but here s my question for those who sneer at or her new memoir about the possible therapeutic value of lsd a really good day how microdosing made a mega difference in my mood my marriage and my life what on earth did you expect here is the truth about ms waldman which complicates matters for those who don t like her she has spent many years struggling with punishing ungovernable moods originally doctors told her she had bipolar ii disorder years later a psychiatrist decided premenstrual dysphoric disorder more closely corresponded with her symptoms and ms waldman agreed but whatever it s called hers is not a mood disorder of the quiet novelistic variety it s big and operatic often driving her to do the very things for which she s been publicly shamed acting out picking fights trawling for affirmation just because she doesn t have a picturesque version of melancholy doesn t make it any less real or any less deserving of compassion and after reading a really good day you understand just why ms waldman might have been willing to experiment to find relief she d exhausted her family she d exhausted all manner of therapies and she d exhausted just about every drug in the pharmacopoeia including the ones that sound like spanish dances cymbalta strattera concerta the ones that look like typing tests zoloft effexor seroquel and the ones that could well be craters on the moon valium ambien lunesta her ambien dependence proved particularly problematic when she took too much she d have text exchanges with mr chabon that looked like this hence ms waldman s trial with lsd 10 micrograms every three days a microdose as she explains is anywhere from to of what one would find on a tab of acid it doesn t turn the world into a bubbling lava lamp this dosage taken at this rate is according to the psychologist and former psychedelic researcher james fadiman mr fadiman s admittedly informal nonrandomized research suggests that people who follow this protocol simply feel better ms waldman wanted to know what something as luxuriously pedestrian as better was like a really good day is a captain s log of her trip it combines daily reports of her moods with the research she s done about the history of psychedelics and her extended meditations on drugs and the law before becoming a writer ms waldman was a federal public defender and what does she find that the experience really is transformative you ve been much happier her younger daughter tells her you ve been controlling your emotions like when you re angry you re the reader doesn t have quite as uniformly positive an experience part of the problem is aesthetic ms waldman has a tendency to slide into the prefab language of psychotherapy or it is suddenly so obvious that what i need to do is just get out of my own way her sense of humor can be unsubtle on the weak magic mushrooms she once tried in college it s possible that all i ate was a handful of dried shiitakes dipped in cow manure she s a fan of extended metaphors and almost no one should be a fan of extended metaphors they involve beating a dead horse converting it to glue and then discovering the glue doesn t work if you see what i mean and her observations can be trite her anxious while meditating now you re thinking about thinking stop berating yourself for thinking will surprise exactly no one but then ms waldman will capture you with genuinely brave and human moments like when she confesses that she yells at people because she enjoys it or when she says her talents aren t considerable enough to earn her a great artist s tempestuous mood swings or expresses guilt that her oldest child has had to bear the brunt of her anger and depression her reminiscences about her time defending poor defenseless clients in los angeles are riveting i am not sure they belong in this book especially when she talks about the unfairness of our sentencing guidelines i mean agreed but this is neither the time nor the place for but i d love to see an independent memoir about her legal work one day ms waldman s survey of the history and literature of psychotropic drugs is informative though it can also on occasion be too sloppy and loose she casually drops the phrase alzheimer benzos short for benzodiazepines that class of drugs including valium and xanax without so much as a footnote and this claim is hardly settled science she writes that francis crick reportedly experimented with lsd when he envisioned the double helix and then takes it back in a footnote couldn t we just pretend it s true she asks no we can t there are other uncareful moments of this kind and other undocumented declarations i mention them not to be picayune but because writing about drug research is a delicate business requiring a certain amount of control in one s voice you really don t want readers doubting your authority when you re making an argument in favor of a maligned and illegal substance but it s an argument that needs to be made as she did with her 2009 essay collection bad mother which decriminalized ordinary mommy infractions and helped bring a sense of proportion to the messy enterprise of parenting ms waldman brings a huge dose of compassion and yes good sense to a really good day whatever her foibles or stylistic lapses she makes a persuasive case for the therapeutic use of psychedelics want to be inspired read the research on the effects of hallucinogens on dying cancer patients as ever ms waldman is wielding her powers of provocation to goad us into an uncomfortable but necessary conversation quibble with her style her methods her desire to attract attention in normalizing the conversation about lsd she may one day help others feel normal

       " 'a few hours after her father s news conference on wednesday at trump tower ivanka trump posted a notice on her personal facebook page officially announcing that she was taking a formal leave of absence from all management and operative responsibilities at her fashion brand and that she would be stepping down from her role at the trump organization she would she wrote be spending the next few months concentrating on settling her children into their new lives in washington and exploring how she could determine the most impactful and appropriate ways for me to serve our country this follows earlier decisions to separate her personal social media accounts from those of her brand yet in one meaningful area ms trump and her brand are harder to divide that is her wardrobe after all the same day she announced she was separating ivanka trump the person from ivanka trump the brand the daily mail announced she had worn an ivanka trump coat to her father s news conference then it offered a box and link in case you know anyone wanted to buy the garment that turned out not to be true according to a spokesman for ms trump the coat was by joseph altuzarra but the confusion around woman and product made for some uncomfortable optics and it raises the question what does it mean to separate individual from company where fashion is concerned on the one hand there s something ridiculous about suggesting that ms trump not wear whatever clothes are in her closet and as the founder of a fashion brand that bears her name presumably part of her job has been to promote said brand by wearing it to in effect demonstrate her belief in her own products so she probably has a lot of such products within reach and it s not her fault if some media outlet chooses to point out that she looks good and tells people how they too can look good on the other hand her brand is clearly built on her image not just her name but her face and what she represents it s selling the promise that women who wear her clothes can get a piece of her gold dust and now that this gold dust is visible in the corridors and news conferences of power that is only going to be more true every time she is pictured in an ivanka trump outfit it is bound to give a boost to the ivanka trump brand whether or not they are technically linked it s unclear whether ms trump would benefit from that financially as specifics about her monetary relationship with her brand were not included in her statement but even if she is selling her part of the company for a prominent member of the first family to be seen to be endorsing a brand with her own name on it is a complicated proposition and an endorsement is exactly what an appearance in an item of clothing has become this is a time like it or not of obsession with the wardrobe selections of anyone in the public eye especially women in the public eye their clothes are more interesting than men s after all and though she has repeatedly said that she will not take a formal role in the new administration ms trump is emerging as the female face of her father s inner circle simply consider the news conference where she was the only woman from the immediate family in attendance there s a reason the daily mail did not get into the specifics of what her brothers wore she is smart enough to know that any time she steps out of her door someone is going to try to snap a picture and parse her clothes you can argue that ms trump is not an elected official and thus to demand that she recuse herself from all products associated with her name is unfair punishment you could say that if she wears for example an alexander mcqueen dress as she did on election night she is giving that brand a boost so why shouldn t she do the same for her own brand you can point out that there is precedent because she wore her own line numerous times during the campaign including to introduce her father at the republican national convention but then the latter choice was not without controversy in part the resulting brouhaha was of course because her brand then promoted that appearance with its own get the look link as it famously did without her knowledge when she wore her bracelet during her family s appearance on 60 minutes presumably that won t happen any more but brands need personalities to succeed at whatever price point and those personalities derive most easily from well a person a scenario in which ivanka trump the brand removes ms trump utterly from its identity is hard to imagine though to be fair the brand s website is adorned with images and line drawings of many different kinds of women and not with ms trump so it may be possible either way this is another illustration of the multiple complicated issues that are going to arise with a member of the first family who also had designs on being a fashion brand there s really no playbook for this as the ivanka team figuring it out as it goes along is quick to remind in which case the clothes question should be the next piece of the puzzle to be solved ',\n",
       " 'you would be to find someone more devoted to the cleveland browns than jeff stemler he exulted over the wins after losses he was so angry that he couldn t speak the team was part of his identity it started in his childhood when the quarterback brian sipe led the browns to improbable victories as an adult mr stemler became a holder he cried when the team moved to baltimore in 1995 and he found love again when the national football league awarded cleveland with a new browns franchise in 1998 but somehow after hundreds of sundays at the stadium or in the television glow it all came to an end it wasn t because the browns were bad necessarily it was something else something deeper mr stemler a landscape supplies salesman in columbus ohio pinpoints the moment to a sunday in october 2014 when the browns thumped the pittsburgh steelers as giddy fans spoke of a new era in cleveland mr stemler felt nothing is this really what makes me happy he asked himself everyone is going nuts and i m just kind of sitting there mr stemler added i remember this guy looking at me and asking what s wrong why aren t you excited the strange feeling did not go away i think i have gotten to a point in my life where i need to let things go that don t bring me enjoyment he said i think as you get older you realize you don t hang on to things that don t bring you joy if it s not making me happy then why do it don t just do it because you feel like you should be doing it that s what i was doing i was going up every sunday for the browns and i was dreading it most fans develop a bond with a team as children for reasons that may go unquestioned they stick with it no matter the emotional toll in the view of the new yorker writer and editor roger angell our connection to sports is ultimately tied to caring deeply and passionately really caring which is a capacity or an emotion that has almost gone out of our lives he wrote in 1975 but then there are those fans who begin to question why they care so much once doubt takes hold they wonder why they spend so much time and emotion on mere games before they know it they are on a path that takes them away from the majority culture for whom sports adulation is the norm julio guerrero 33 was an impressionable boy when the quarterback brett favre came on the scene for the green bay packers in 1992 as favre gave new life to the packers mr guerrero who lives in milwaukee and manages a call center became devoted to the team and joined the sunday ritual that defines football fandom you don t miss a game unless you have like a really special family function like a wedding or a funeral he said that is part of your sunday it s part of the culture it s what you do you go to work five days a week and you make sure you watch the packers mr guerrero embraced favre s style of play here was an unruly kid from mississippi who won over green bay fans with his gunslinger style and led the team to a super bowl victory it seemed as if the fun would go on forever but when favre left the packers in 2008 mr guerrero sensed his devotion starting to wane somehow he couldn t relate to favre s successor aaron rodgers and he realized his fandom had reached an end when he wasn t thrilled by the packers super bowl victory in 2011 he no longer spends his sundays in front of the tv he has become the guy at work who can t talk about the game on monday morning he has built a new life for himself that doesn t include football i think the new set of friends i have are more into music and movies and arts which is more of what i am into these days mr guerrero said i don t really feel that connected anymore to people who go to the bar and watch the football game every sunday even before he attended the university of north carolina at chapel hill robert mcnees lived for its basketball team the tar heels now an associate professor of physics at loyola university chicago he can still see a freshman named michael jordan hitting the game winner against georgetown in the 1982 n c a a tournament championship game dr mcnees s affection for the team lasted well after he graduated but as he grew older he began to realize that much of his emotional attachment was bound to his fond memories of his college days his moment of reckoning came in 2012 after holding a lead with two and a half minutes to go against duke north carolina ended up losing at the buzzer dr mcnees was inconsolable then he started to question himself i was bummed out after that he said then i was bummed out about the fact that i was so bummed out about it why these are two groups of to playing a game it should not have that much of an impact on a grown man dr mcnees 43 decided to take a step back he has not sworn off the tar heels altogether but he no longer watches every game and when he does he is careful not to allow the outcome to ruin his day finding that kind of middle ground is not an option for most fans including rob jordan a lawyer in manhattan as a child he had posters of the baseball stars ken griffey jr and mike piazza on the walls of his bedroom as mike schmidt cried while announcing his retirement at a 1989 news conference mr jordan wept right along with him his fandom deepened with the rise of fantasy sports he became well versed in even the most obscure baseball basketball and football players and he said he won thousands of dollars as a result of his expertise about the time he turned 30 he decided that fantasy sports was no longer the best use of his time and it wasn t a big step from cutting out fantasy to leaving behind sports fandom altogether recently mr jordan gave up cable tv meaning he no longer has access to espn he didn t bother to watch an inning of the 2016 world series not even game 7 which was viewed by 40 million although it was broadcast on network television i think there was a point where i consciously looked around and said hey i can keep admiring and celebrating the accomplishments of somebody else for a minimal amount of entertainment value or i can better allocate that time toward my own dreams and projects mr jordan said clearly i came out on the side of the latter it got to a point where even seeing a grown man in his wearing a jersey with some other name on the back struck me as immature and odd he added you say come on man grow up ',\n",

       " 'washington the house cleared the way on friday for speedy action to repeal the affordable care act putting congress on track to undo the most significant health care law in a with a near vote of 227 to 198 the house overcame the opposition of democrats and the anxieties of some republicans to approve a budget blueprint that allows republicans to end major provisions of president obama s health care law without the threat of a democratic filibuster in the senate donald j trump speaker paul d ryan and other republican leaders now face a much bigger challenge devising their own plan to ensure broad access to health care and coverage while controlling costs while their party is far from a consensus on how to replace the health care law under which more than 20 million americans have gained health insurance they will need votes from democrats in the senate to enact a robust replacement plan republicans have argued that americans have been crushed by soaring premiums and other unintended effects of the law which was adopted without any republican votes this is a critical first step toward delivering relief to americans who are struggling under this law mr ryan said adding this experiment has failed democrats warned that repeal of the health law would cause hardship for millions of americans and create chaos in insurance markets and in the health care system which accounts for about 18 percent of the nation s economy if we go down this path we won t have repeal and replace said representative john yarmuth of kentucky the senior democrat on the house budget committee what we ll have is repeal and repent because we re going to owe a huge apology to the american people for the damage that we cause representative suzan delbene of washington a democrat said there s still no plan for what comes next threatening massive disruption to the entire health care system in the days before the house vote some conservative republicans as well as moderates expressed discomfort about signing off on the budget blueprint without having a clearer picture of how and when republican leaders planned to replace the health care law nine house republicans ended up voting against the budget measure on friday no democrats voted for it the senate approved the same measure early thursday by a vote of 51 to 48 the house and senate votes this week essentially procedural steps represented the first of several moves that republicans plan to make as they work to unwind the health care law in the coming weeks they say they will try to devise a replacement working closely with mr trump and his choice to lead the department of health and human services representative tom price of georgia four committees two in the senate two in the house will write language repealing major provisions of the 2010 health law the resulting legislation can be passed with simple majorities in both chambers and will be immune to a democratic filibuster in the senate then republicans say they will pass one or more bills to replace selected provisions of the affordable care act in the senate where republicans hold 52 seats they will need help from democrats to reach the 60 votes necessary to approve such legislation mr trump voiced support this week for repealing and replacing the health care law essentially simultaneously though it remained to be seen if republicans in the senate can win enough democratic support to adopt a replacement for the existing health care law given the need to reach 60 votes in the house debate on friday republicans and democrats offered wildly differing views of health care and health insurance representative jason lewis of minnesota a republican said he had firsthand experience with the affordable care act minnesotans have seen their health insurance choices shrink while their premiums and deductibles skyrocket mr lewis said i should know for the last in fact over five years i ve been in the individual market and my own insurance premiums have nearly tripled and i ve gone through three insurers minnesotans have seen a 50 to 67 percent increase in the premium cost this year alone the house democratic leader representative nancy pelosi of california who helped engineer passage of the health law defended it on friday saying that every american benefited the republicans are feeding their ideological obsession with repealing the a c a and dismantling the health and economic security of families ms pelosi said for six years she said republicans have had the chance to put forth an alternative but we ve seen nothing echoing their colleagues in the senate democrats asked how republicans planned to go about replacing the affordable care act a complex arduous task as democrats know from their own experience developing and passing the health law in the first place when you put pen to paper all hell is going to break loose on your side said representative peter welch democrat of vermont democrats also tried to draw attention to what they said would be the devastating consequences of repealing the health care law over and over after a republican member spoke out against the law mr yarmuth offered several data points specific to the member s home state including how many people would lose their health coverage republicans though were eager to deliver on a central campaign promise the public has rendered judgment on this health care law said representative john shimkus of illinois the differing views among house members on friday foreshadowed the acrimony that is all but certain in the weeks to come as republicans press ahead with their repeal efforts over democrats strenuous objections so far lawmakers have shown some creativity in trying to explain the wisdom or lack of wisdom in moving forward with a repeal on friday representative drew ferguson of georgia a freshman republican likened the health care law to a goat that had been let loose in a person s home now for six years that goat has been messing in and destroying my house he said i want to renovate my house but before i can i have to get the goat out of the house before it does any more damage it makes no sense to start fixing up my house until we get the goat out voting for the measure on friday mr ferguson said would get rid of the goat ',\n",
       " 'it looks like the beginning of the end for obamacare as we know it after years of vowing to repeal the affordable care act as it is formally known republican lawmakers in both chambers of congress have now passed a bill that will make it easier to gut the law because they are using a special budget process republicans won t be able to repeal all provisions of the health law but it seems like a good time to look at the major changes obamacare brought to health care which of those changes may now disappear and what might replace them an important note we still don t know the details of a repeal bill and passage is not guaranteed but republicans passed a similar package in 2015 vetoed by president obama that provides a rough template republicans have also said they hope to make further changes through additional legislation we ll provide updates when new legislative language arrives expected in several weeks the health law reduced the number of uninsured americans by an estimated 20 million people from 2010 to 2016 one of the primary ways it did so was by creating online markets where people who didn t get insurance through work or the government could shop for a health plan from a private insurer the law offered subsidies for americans with lower incomes to help pay their premiums and deductibles what would happen the republican bill is expected to eliminate the subsidies this would make insurance unaffordable for millions of americans and sharply reduce the number who buy their own health coverage with many fewer people buying coverage the insurance markets are likely to become increasingly unstable many insurers will stop offering policies and the remaining customers are likely to be sicker than current obamacare buyers a reality that will drive up the cost of insurance for everyone who buys it and force more people out of the markets the urban institute estimates that the change would cause a total of 22 5 million people to lose their health insurance what might replace it separate legislation may include some new form of subsidy to help people afford insurance plans from house speaker paul ryan and the budget committee chairman tom price donald j trump s pick to lead the department of health and human services would both offer a flat tax credit to help buy insurance that varies by age a proposal from the house republican study committee would give all americans a standard tax deduction to buy insurance the health law provided federal funds for states to offer medicaid coverage to anyone earning less than about 16 000 for a single person or 33 000 for a family of four not every state chose to expand but most did what would happen the republican plan is expected to eliminate federal funding for the expansion an estimated 12 9 million people would lose medicaid coverage according to the urban institute s projections what might replace it republican leaders have discussed reforming the remaining medicaid program to give states more autonomy and to reduce future federal investment one of the law s signature features prevents insurance companies from denying coverage or charging a higher price to someone with a health problem the law included a host of other protections for all health plans a ban on setting a lifetime limit on how much an insurer has to pay to cover someone a requirement that insurers offer a minimum package of benefits a guarantee that preventive health services be covered without a a cap on insurance company profits and limits on how much more insurers can charge older people than younger people the law also required insurance plans to allow adult children to stay on their parents policies until age 26 what would happen these rules can t be changed using the special budget process so they would stay in place for now but eliminating some of the other provisions like the subsidies and leaving the insurance rules could create turmoil in the insurance markets since sick customers would have a much stronger incentive to stay covered when premiums rise what might replace it mr trump has said that he d like to keep the law s policies on conditions and family coverage for young adults but senate republicans recently voted against nonbinding resolutions to preserve those measures suggesting they may be less committed some of the other provisions would probably be on the table if there were new legislation republicans in congress would probably eliminate rules that require a minimum package of benefits for all insurance plans and allow states to determine what insurers would have to include mr trump has said he d like to encourage the sale of insurance across state lines a policy likely to make coverage more skimpy but less expensive for many customers republicans would also like to expand tax incentives for people to save money for health expenses many of the republican proposals would also establish pools which would provide subsidized insurance options for people with chronic health problems who wouldn t be able to buy insurance without rules forcing insurers to sell them coverage to ensure that enough healthy people entered insurance markets the law included mandates to encourage broader coverage large employers that failed to offer affordable coverage or individuals who failed to obtain insurance could be charged a tax penalty what would happen the bill is expected to eliminate the mandates some experts think that eliminating the individual mandate in particular could destabilize insurance markets by reducing incentives for healthy people to buy coverage the mandate had less of an impact on the employers which had already been offering coverage what might replace it some republican plans would allow insurers to charge much higher rates to customers who allow their coverage to lapse than to those who renew their policies every year such a system might provide a different financial incentive for healthy people to stay insured to help pay for the law s coverage expansion it raised taxes on several players in the health industry and on earners what would happen the g o p package may roll back those tax increases though there is some disagreement among republican lawmakers about the deficit impact of such changes what might replace it republicans have not discussed raising new taxes to replace those in the affordable care act but some of their plans would limit the tax benefits offered to people who get their health insurance through work that change would increase tax revenues but would increase the cost of health insurance for many people who get it through work the law cut the annual pay raises medicare gives hospitals and reduced the fees medicare pays private insurance companies it created new incentives for hospitals and doctors to improve quality it also set up a special office to run experiments in how medicare pays doctors and hospitals for health care services those experiments are now widespread and have begun changing the way medicine is practiced in some places what would happen the new legislation is expected to leave these changes alone even though many have come under criticism by republicans in congress over the years including from mr price an orthopedic surgeon many of the experiments could be reshaped or eliminated through regulation or through a future budget process what might replace it republicans in congress have long talked about even more ambitious changes to medicare intended to move more beneficiaries into private insurance coverage mr trump has said that he does not want to make major changes to medicare so it is unclear if such a proposal would move forward obamacare had a range of policies meant to improve health and health care including requirements that drug companies report payments made to physicians a provision written by the iowa senator chuck grassley a republican a requirement that chain restaurants publish calorie counts on their menus and a rule that large employers must provide a space for women to express breast milk what would happen when republicans talk about repealing obamacare they tend to focus on the parts of the law that expanded insurance coverage and regulated health insurance products not these ancillary parts that means that portions of the affordable care act that people don t associate with the word obamacare are likely to endure ',\n",

he becomes president a trump spokesman said friday mr flynn s secret call did not violate the law mr trump s spokesman said but under the circumstances it is bound to raise eyebrows the call centered around the logistics of setting up a call with the president of russia and the after he was sworn in and they exchanged logistical information sean spicer mr trump s spokesman told reporters on a conference call on friday that was it plain and simple several news organizations reported on thursday on the calls between the two men david ignatius of the washington post suggested it could have violated the logan act a law that bars american citizens from negotiating without authorization with foreign governments that have a dispute with the united states mr spicer said general flynn had initially reached out to mr kislyak via text message on christmas day to wish him a happy holiday and to say that he looked forward to working with him in the coming administration the ambassador sent a text back returning the sentiment he added the russian envoy followed up on dec 28 with another text that asked if he could call general flynn and the two spoke mr spicer said the call which came the day before mr obama announced penalties for russia including the expulsion from the united states of 35 russian diplomats never touched on the sanctions mr spicer said it was bad enough that a new gallup poll on friday morning found that only 44 percent of americans approve of the way mr trump has handled his transition compared with 83 percent who approved of president obama s transition and 61 percent who approved of george w bush s that followed a quinnipiac university poll this week that put mr trump s approval rating at 37 percent but now representative john lewis democrat of georgia

performances before the senate which have gone well on the whole and the progress congress is making toward gutting the affordable care act and the house is likely to give final approval on friday to

       " 'it happened one night in the late summer of 1954 jules schulback a new york furrier and taker of home movies heard that marilyn monroe would be on the upper east side of manhattan filming scenes again for her new picture the seven year itch two days earlier mr schulback had taken footage of her with his bolex movie camera around the corner from his townhouse apartment so he grabbed the camera the one usually used for family picnics and parades and the stuff of everyday life and headed over to the subway grate in front of wright s food shop just down the street from the movie theater on lexington avenue and 52nd street though it was around 1 a m a large crowd had already gathered mostly newspaper photographers and curious men waiting to see marilyn the movie studio and the director billy wilder had counted on this inviting the press and the public to drum up buzz for the new movie which starred ms monroe as the girl upstairs who entices a executive played by tom ewell while his wife is away with the kids for the summer in the famous street scene the two are leaving the movies as ms monroe pauses over a grate to enjoy the breeze from the subway as it blows up her dress on a hot summer night isn t it delicious she purrs the breeze came from a large fan under the grate operated by the film s special effects chief the night sept 15 was actually quite chilly but the stunt worked it became known as the shot seen around the world but there was a dark subtext to the comedy gathered at that late hour were hundreds of gawkers almost all men who catcalled and yelled things like higher higher as ms monroe s dress blew up over her head for two hours the men watched from surrounding buildings and from the street unfortunately one of them was her husband joe dimaggio mr wilder is quoted as saying in his biography nobody s perfect and he didn t like what he saw or what everyone else was seeing mr dimaggio hadn t planned on visiting the set that night and was waiting for his wife at the st regis hotel where the couple were staying but the columnist walter winchell had persuaded him to come along ms monroe was not happy her husband had shown up but he was even more unhappy and angrily stormed off later that night the couple had a screaming fight in their room the next morning her hairdresser covered up ms monroe s bruises with makeup three weeks later ms monroe filed for divorce mr wilder never used the lexington avenue footage and reshot the scene on a closed lot in hollywood though photographs of that night appeared everywhere except for some brief grainy shots from a newsreel covering the divorce footage from that night was never screened the footage immediately disappeared mr wilder said in the biography but one day i m sure some film scholar will dig it up the story of the night marilyn monroe s white dress blew up was well known among jules schulback s children and even among his grandchildren his granddaughter bonnie siegler said he bragged from time to time about his personal film shoot with marilyn he was a real raconteur said ms siegler a graphic designer who runs her own company eight and a half i didn t know if the story was real but even though she had never seen it she often told people that her grandfather had footage of marilyn monroe on the subway grate ms siegler s older sister rayna dineen said her grandfather whom they called opi a german term of endearment was rarely without his camera he would be filming everywhere all the time there were reels of vacations family picnics birthday parties and bar mitzvahs he had even filmed a day in the life of his daughters depicting them waking up brushing their teeth and going to school but the marilyn story was one of his favorite stories to tell ms dineen said it was just one of dozens of amazing tales mr schulback had a long technicolorful life one so filled with drama that his monroe story sometimes seemed like a footnote in 1938 mr schulback had argued with his family in germany that adolf hitler was much more dangerous than anyone thought according to ms siegler his family believed that hitler s hate speech was simply rhetoric and that he wouldn t act on anything he was saying mr schulback 25 at the time urged them to pack their bags and leave berlin with him but they resisted opting to wait and see how things developed never imagining the horror that awaited them and millions of other european jews mr schulback was not taking any chances in 1938 jews immigrating to the united states needed a sponsor someone to take financial responsibility for them mr schulback sold everything he had bought an expensive suit booked passage on the queen mary reserved a room at the plaza and headed to america to find a sponsor for him and his wife edith and their daughter helen who was then a toddler he was like i m your lost rich relative i won t be a burden but he had no money he played it ms siegler said he secured a signature then returned to collect his family but was stopped trying to enter nazi germany by a suspicious border guard knowing the germans were big fans of the 1934 clark gable hit it happened one night mr schulback told the guard he was the distributor for mr gable s new movie he claimed that if he couldn t enter the country neither would the film the guy was like oh we love clark gable and waved him through ms siegler said mr schulback grabbed edith and helen again imploring his other relatives to leave and escaped back to the united states with a few suitcases claiming to the nazi immigration officers that his family was going on vacation the date was nov 8 the day before kristallnacht in berlin he had been a furrier and his shop was destroyed that night his remaining family four sisters parents and would all perish in the holocaust the united states was good to mr schulback he and his family lived a happy successful life in new york much of it preserved in his home movies as a child ms siegler loved going to her grandfather s upper east side apartment not just because of his great stories and sense of humor but also because he lived opposite the new york doll hospital from his apartment window she could see the buckets of doll eyes and doll arms it was really intense she said when edith had a stroke in the 1970s she was given only a few weeks to live but mr schulback always a man of action refused to let his wife die in the hospital and took her home the couple moved into the apartment of a building around the corner and mr schulback became her nurse half her body was paralyzed she couldn t speak ms siegler said but he loved her and took care of her for 26 years until she finally died after 35 years in that same apartment mr schulback who had been president of the 61st street block association was forced to leave the andrew w mellon foundation had bought the townhouse where he lived and the one behind it and wanted to reconfigure the property so ms siegler and her husband jeff scher helped move her grandfather to a new place on the other side of central park in 2004 in the arduous packing up of mr schulback s home the couple came across a big stash of film it was stored in a back room that the family called opi s fur room where mr schulback had once assembled garments from animal pelts for his business no one ever wanted to go back there ms siegler said but when we went in we found this plastic bag filled with just tons of film home movies bought movies and everything mixed together ms siegler s husband an experimental filmmaker couldn t wait to screen the films he was particularly interested in seeing whether marilyn and the subway grate footage actually existed it was like this family myth mr scher said so long rumored and never confirmed the same was true for its source material for decades innuendo swirled around the lexington avenue shoot for the seven year itch ms monroe and mr dimaggio had married that january and had already had a bumpy ride the yankee clipper enraged by her exhibitionism and by rumors of infidelity according to lois w banner the author of the 2012 biography marilyn the passion and the paradox she was having an affair with her musical director at the time and everyone knew about it in the business said dr banner a professor emeritus of history and gender studies at the university of southern california so before he even arrived on set there was tension dimaggio dr banner said was not happy with marilyn there are several theories as to why the footage from that night was never used some believe the manhattan shoot was done purely as a publicity stunt which was made even more sensational when mr dimaggio showed up some biographers say the enthusiastic crowd was just too noisy making the film unusable a third theory was that the footage was too risqué and ms monroe wanted to shoot a more demure version so as not to further infuriate her husband there was even talk at the time that she wasn t wearing any underwear mr wilder tried to put those rumors to rest in his biography she had put on not just one but two sets of underwear he said dr banner said all three reasons quite likely played into the final decision to reshoot but the photographs of that night had gone viral by the time the film was being put together she said and played a great role in her fame the scene used in the finished film is incredibly brief and tame the image many people have of that moment comes from the press shots and publicity stills in new york and not from the finished movie back in the pelt room of mr schulback s apartment mr scher excitedly gathered up the old metal film canisters none were labeled mr scher recalled some of the film was off the reel and sitting there like big balls of spaghetti as if there had been a projector mishap years ago later that night in his studio in the couple s apartment on west 16th street mr scher slowly and carefully wound the film since some of it was very brittle and in danger of breaking he did a few repairs and then began looking at it using a light box spooling it from reel to reel by hand there were about 50 rolls of film and around 75 rolls of 8 millimeter there were the family outings and parades the birthdays and bar mitzvahs and there amid the mundane scenes of precious everyday life was marilyn monroe in crisp colorful kodachrome this stuff just popped out mr scher said it was real preserved like the home movies are too just these moments in time mr scher could clearly see the actress s dress billowing up like a parachute with a pair of legs attached he said it was startling like seeing a myth materialize it was a shadow version of lost footage amid home movies of a family that almost certainly wouldn t have existed had the schulbacks stayed in germany mr scher called out to his wife it s really here they watched all 3 minutes 17 seconds in amazement there was something so magical about it ms siegler said for years i didn t know if it was real i certainly didn t believe it wholeheartedly and there it was it was like the end of the story the film starts with a intertitle that reads world premiere mr schulback s little inside joke and then there is marilyn monroe in a white terry robe coming down the stoop of a building at 164 east 61st street between lexington and third avenues it was the earlier scene before the subway grate footage that mr schulback had shot cameramen and press photographers are gathered outside as the actress smiles and waves cut to ms monroe in a window wearing a slip and her hair mr ewell walks down the street and into the building the film cuts inexplicably to 30 seconds of what must be a shriners parade in manhattan then jumps to another intertitle which reads our baby and suddenly there is ms monroe again this time on the subway grate in that famously fluttering white dress holding a matching white clutch in her right hand and a scarf in her left mr schulback was incredibly close filming right behind mr wilder s shoulder stopping to wind his camera every 25 seconds now and then a silhouette of the director s arm intrudes into mr schulback s shot at one point mr wilder in a fedora passes across the frame ms monroe gets into position and yawns while the cinematographer sets up the camera through a gap in the film crew mr schulback captures just her face looking off to the left serious and unsmiling then mr ewell is there chatting with ms monroe who pushes him into position the dress flutters again ms monroe holds it down bending slightly smiling and talking to mr ewell but it flutters up some more and she laughs her head thrown back it blows up again but she doesn t push it down this time and it flies up over her head clearly revealing two pairs of underwear that because of the bright lights do not protect ms monroe s modesty quite as much as she might have liked then as suddenly as she appeared marilyn is gone and the film reverts to mode edith schulback walking on the grass at a family outing in the country it s like being shaken from some crazy dream back to reality interest in that moment in film history from more than 50 years ago endures the new movie musical starring ryan gosling and emma stone la la land makes brief filmic reference to it in the opening number with a young dancer s yellow dress blowing up and a snickers commercial from the super bowl last year stars willem dafoe eugene levy and a monroe on the famous set it s that iconic image said dr banner the monroe biographer people are still fascinated by the context in which it all happened after screening the film with her husband ms siegler immediately told her grandfather that she had found the footage i was so excited about it more

       " 'hong kong at the addiction treatment center in eastern china more than 6 000 internet addicts most of them teenagers not only had their web access taken away they were also treated with electroshock therapy the center in shandong province made headlines in september after one of its patients killed her mother in retribution for abuse she had purportedly suffered at the camp during a forced detox regimen now china is trying to regulate camps like the one in shandong which have become a last resort for parents exasperated by their child s habit of playing online games for hours on end the government has drafted a law that would crack down on the camps worst excesses including electroshock and other physical punishments medical specialists welcomed the law announced this week in china s news media as an initial step toward curbing scandals in the industry it s a very important move for protecting young children said tao ran the director of the internet addiction clinic at beijing military general hospital dr tao said that many chinese parents believe that the effects of electroshock therapy are fleeting but he had seen several chinese teenagers return from boot camps that treat internet addiction showing signs of lasting psychological trauma he said they didn t talk were afraid to meet people and refused to leave their homes he said referring to his meetings with the teenagers they were panicked even to hear the word hospital and doctor qu xinjiu a law professor at china university of political science and law in beijing said the belief that parents have supreme jurisdiction over their children and that even police officers have no right to intervene in family affairs is widespread in china that s why there are so many parents sending their kids for electroshock therapy even when outsiders think it s wrong to do so professor qu said figures on the number or growth of internet detox camps in china are scarce but the camps methods have been generating concern for years the legislation would also limit how much time each day that minors could play online games at home or in internet bars providers of the games would be obliged to take measures to monitor and restrict use such as requiring players to register under their real names the law does not yet specify the number of hours allowed but minors would be prohibited from playing online games anywhere between midnight and 8 a m dr tao said he doubted that the draft law which was introduced by the state council china s cabinet could be enforced evenly nationwide provisions to limit the number of hours spent online probably could be easily flouted he said many users of sina weibo china s version of twitter were even more critical saying policing teenagers behavior online seemed impractical and i m afraid it s just empty talk a sina weibo user wrote what about young kids who always go online on their cellphones another wrote isn t that also an addiction game providers and internet bars that did not enforce the law would be subject to fines and possible closure by the government reports in the chinese news media this week said that lawmakers would accept public comments on the draft law through early february but gave no indication of when it might be put into practice in 2009 the chinese health ministry issued guidelines against using electroshock therapy for internet addicts trent m bax the author of youth and internet addiction in china said that he wondered whether a ban would be any more effective despite the health ministry s policy punitive practices continue to victimize china s youth in internet detox camps said dr bax an assistant professor of sociology at ewha womans university in seoul south korea researchers from chinese taiwanese and german universities wrote in the journal psychiatry in 2014 that the highest prevalence of problematic internet use worldwide had been observed in asia christian montag the study s lead author said in an email on thursday that south korea had the world s highest rate of problematic internet use in part because of its large technology sector and online game market south korea also offers camps for internet addiction recent scientific evidence indicates that the best treatments for digital addiction appear to be cognitive behavioral therapy in individual and group settings which often include patients parents and significant others said daria j kuss a specialist on internet and game addiction at nottingham trent university in britain dr kuss said that medication can also be effective especially if internet addiction is accompanied by anxiety or mood disorders such as depression but beatings and electroshock therapy are not commonly used in the treatment of internet and gaming addiction and are to be considered unethical and inhumane she said officials and psychologists around the world have debated how to measure and regulate extreme internet use a crucial question analysts say is whether to classify the problem as a psychological disorder or as a symptom of underlying disorders in a sign of how fluid the debate is in china the health ministry said in 2009 that it would no longer use the term addiction to describe how the internet harmed people who used it improperly or excessively but a study the same year by the china youth association for network development which is led by a committee under the ruling communist party found that more than 24 million chinese age 13 to 29 who used the internet were digital addicts ',\n",
       " 'the united states mint will release a commemorative gold coin in april that will feature lady liberty as a black woman marking the first time that she has been depicted as anything other than white on the nation s currency the coin with a 100 face value will commemorate the 225th anniversary of the mint s coin production the mint and the treasury department announced on thursday going on sale april 6 it will be 24 karats and weigh about an ounce it is part of a series of commemorative coins that will be released every two years future ones will show lady liberty as asian hispanic and indian to reflect the cultural and ethnic diversity of the united states the mint said in a statement the announcement comes at a pivotal cultural moment for the united states a week away from a transfer of power following a bruising election dominated by debates about immigration race and political correctness and lady liberty is among the most potent of american symbols her depiction a gift from france in 1886 stands in new york harbor a giant statue of a woman with white european features beckoning with a lamp to the refugees of the world part of our intent was to honor our tradition and heritage rhett jeppson the principal deputy director of the mint said in a phone interview on friday but we also think it s always worthwhile to have a conversation about liberty and we certainly have started that conversation do not expect to see anyone spending the coins at the store coins like this do not circulate for everyday use but are minted for collectors in limited quantities there will be 100 000 of them with the black lady liberty they will sell for far more than face value depending on the value of gold currently more than 1 000 an ounce as we as a nation continue to evolve so does liberty s representation elisa basnight the chief of staff at the mint said at a presentation on thursday in washington the coin s head what the mint calls the obverse was designed by justin kunz and engraved by phebe hemphill and it shows a profile of lady liberty with a crown of stars that holds back her hair the tail the reverse in mint lingo shows an eagle in flight mr jeppson said that several women had approached him after seeing the coin and told him she looks like me when i was younger i saw real value in that he said that we see ourselves in the images in our coins the mint is expecting the coin to sell well mr jeppson said any profit the mint generates from the sale of its coins is returned to the treasury last year the mint sent about 600 million back to the federal government mr jeppson said in addition to the 100 000 gold coins more than is typical for this sort of commemorative coin that will be printed at west point the mint will also produce 100 000 of what it calls medals silver reproductions of the image that will sell for around 40 to 50 the silver medals will be done at philadelphia because that is the birthplace of the mint mr jeppson said the coinage act of 1792 established the mint and it also mandated that any coins produced include an image of liberty as well as an inscription of the word since then the idea has appeared in many forms on american currency both circulated and collectible most often as the feminine lady liberty when you look at the very first coins that we produced they had a liberty on there mr jeppson said these coins are already in production the next ones in the series are in the planning stage rough guidelines are given to sets of artists and sculptors some of whom are staff at the mint and others who are part of a pool as mr kunz was their work is then shared with the members of two commissions one a group of citizen advisers and one a fine arts commission who make recommendations on the final design for the coin it s difficult for us to say what future coins will look like until we get there mr jeppson said all american coins embody the idea of liberty in keeping with the mint s mandate but the new coin is what mr jeppson called an allegorical liberty meaning lady liberty does not represent a specific figure from history women in generic depictions or historic ones have been underrepresented on american currency the suffrage leader susan b anthony appeared on 1 coins from 1979 to 1981 and helen keller the author and activist appeared on the reverse image of the alabama state quarter in 2003 sacagawea the shoshone guide who led lewis and clark to the west coast appeared on a 1 coin that has been minted since 2000 last year after a public campaign to put a woman on the 10 bill the treasury secretary jacob j lew announced a broad remaking of the nation s paper currency the bills that unlike a 100 coin circulate among many americans every day harriet tubman the abolitionist and former slave will appear on the 20 bill and women and civil rights leaders will be added to the 5 and 10 bills collectors expect the black lady liberty coin to be popular whenever the mint does something new it creates buzz said gilles bransbourg a curator with the american numismatic society and a research associate at new york university it s departing from any of the coins that have been produced so far he said it sends a strong message that the mint is departing from the tradition that will be perceived as very white the mint s recent commemorative productions have occasionally featured nonwhite characters he said pointing to a 2006 gold series that revived the popular indian head nickel of the early 20th century it shows an american indian whose face is believed to be a combination of three different men who sat for its designer symbolism aside the new lady liberty coin is really beautiful said jeff garrett the president of the american numismatic association who saw the coin several months ago in washington it s struck in high relief which means the high points are much higher than circulating coinage i ll buy one for sure he said i ll probably buy several

       " 'the hunt for the people behind volkswagen s emissions scandal did not end with the company s plea bargain this week there was the man identified in court documents only as supervisor b who overruled nervous subordinates and told them to develop the illegal software don t get caught he told them according to the documents there was attorney a who as regulators closed in urged to destroy any emails that mentioned the acoustic function the code name for emissions cheating software the two suspects were conspicuously missing from the group of six volkswagen executives indicted on wednesday a clear indication that there could be more criminal charges further eroding the company s reputation and destabilizing management there is little doubt that investigators will lean on suspects to testify against others and push as high up in volkswagen s organization chart as the evidence allows the 20 billion that volkswagen is paying to resolve civil and criminal charges including obstruction of justice and conspiracy to defraud the united states government is unlikely to be the end of the story even as the settlement removed a major source of uncertainty for the company other cases loom shareholder lawsuits in the united states and europe could cost an additional 10 billion united states authorities also signaled that investigators will not be constrained by national boundaries five of the six people indicted on wednesday are believed to be in germany the cost of the united states settlements drains cash that volkswagen urgently needs to adapt to technological upheaval cars services and other innovations are expected to upend the industry the settlement is an important step that will help volkswagen to win back trust in the united states said ferdinand dudenhöffer a professor at the university of but the cost he said will set back volkswagen s plans and in my opinion require cuts in investment in the united states volkswagen clearly hoped the settlement would be the turning point that allows it to begin rebuilding its shattered reputation the company issued publicity photographs this week of a shiny replacement for the blue and white vw logo that for decades has stood like a giant hood ornament atop volkswagen s executive offices in its hometown wolfsburg volkswagen deeply regrets the behavior that gave rise to the diesel crisis matthias müller its chief executive said in a statement since all of this came to light we have worked tirelessly to make things right for our affected customers but the settlement and the admissions made by the company in the deal leave volkswagen vulnerable in other ways as part of an agreement that calls for volkswagen to pay 4 3 billion in penalties and plead guilty to violations of the clean air act the company signed off on a detailed account of how the cheating software came into being and how volkswagen employees tried to cover it up after regulators suspicions were aroused the document portrays a broad conspiracy that included engine developers software experts quality control managers lawyers and people responsible for emissions compliance the account of the wrongdoing reinforces the view that volkswagen corporate culture was seriously awry employees who raised objections to the wrongdoing were overruled by those higher up in 2012 for example senior executives rebuffed a group of volkswagen engineers who had discovered the illegal software the engineers were told to destroy documents they had prepared showing how the software worked according to a federal indictment unsealed this week instead of coming clean after regulators began asking questions in 2014 volkswagen executives mounted a ahead of a meeting with california regulators in august 2015 according to the plea agreement volkswagen officials even drew up a script for what they would say to conceal the illegal software and win approval for new models to go on sale such evidence could be used to bolster other cases shareholders in the united states and europe have filed lawsuits saying volkswagen had a duty to warn much sooner of the potential financial havoc that would be caused by the official investigations company shares plunged after the scandal came to light and have not fully recovered further charges could also wreak havoc on the upper ranks the document does not directly implicate members of the volkswagen management board but it does not exonerate them either several of the people indicted reported directly to martin winterkorn the volkswagen chief executive until he resigned in the wake of the scandal there was some good news for volkswagen the maximum penalty just for the criminal violations would have been 34 billion according to department of justice calculations volkswagen received a discount for being cooperative after its initial stonewalling and for the nearly 16 billion it is paying to owners of volkswagen diesels dealers and others as compensation the deal was the product of weeks of negotiations by representatives for the government and volkswagen all of whom were eager to resolve the case before donald j trump takes office volkswagen sales have been holding up even though the company s reputation has taken a beating volkswagen said this week that it sold 10 3 million vehicles worldwide in 2016 a 4 percent increase over 2015 but volkswagen s market share in europe which accounts for about a third of sales slipped during the year to 24 percent from 25 percent and the company continues to struggle in the united states sales of volkswagen brand cars fell 8 percent last year to 323 000 vehicles though there were signs of a rebound toward the end of the year it will be difficult for anyone associated with the scandal to rest easy the specter of further indictments and arrests along with the bad publicity they generate is likely to weigh on company morale if not its financial prospects top managers are not immune german prosecutors have said they consider hans dieter pötsch chairman of the volkswagen supervisory board a suspect in a related investigation into possible violations of securities laws volkswagen said in a statement that its management board duly fulfilled its disclosure obligation under german capital markets law mr pötsch was a member of the management board before becoming chairman of the supervisory board an oversight panel in october 2015 germany does not usually extradite its own citizens but any employees indicted by united states authorities risk arrest if they travel outside germany even to other european countries unusually only one member of the volkswagen management board attended the north american international auto show a major industry event that is underway in detroit herbert diess head of the unit that produces volkswagen brand cars who joined the company shortly before the scandal came to light was the highest ranking company executive in detroit volkswagen said in a statement that the smaller presence was the result of a critical assessment of the efficiency and effectiveness of its car show activities volkswagen had hoped to use the detroit auto show to reconnect with american consumers it showed off the atlas a sport utility vehicle with three rows of seats that will be made at volkswagen s plant in chattanooga tenn and fill a gap in

       " 'when wells fargo announced its quarterly earnings friday morning it was clear that many of its customers were not exactly pleased in recent months the number of new consumer checking accounts had fallen sharply which is no surprise for a bank that paid a hefty fine in september for opening accounts of all sorts without customers permission just for good measure it s trying to force customers who want to sue to take their disputes to mandatory arbitration and in its earnings announcement the company said that measurements of loyalty were going to take awhile longer to recover to many consumers wells fargo deserves a kind of death penalty in the same way one might never buy a car again from the cheaters at volkswagen it makes little sense to do business with wells fargo either but an equally good reason to steer clear might be this its products and services are mostly middling the bank rarely is a leader on pricing or rewards it specializes in ubiquity with storefronts in all 50 states and it hopes that we ll be too lazy to find better deals elsewhere the bank claims to be serious about pivoting now despite having only shuffled the deck chairs in its executive roster ousting its c e o and elevating his top deputy so if it wants to stand for something in the minds of consumers other than shoving unwanted products down people s throats it might try new approaches like generosity clarity integrity and good citizenship on for size instead let s take some of those things and the bank s offerings in order generosity consider wells fargo s basic savings account offerings or don t lest you be insulted by the interest rates how does 0 01 percent sound to you but if you have more than 100 000 that you need to keep safe for a while the bank will increase that amount tenfold to a whopping 0 1 percent is there something about being a large financial institution that makes offering a competitive interest rate impossible not at all household names like barclays discover and goldman sachs are happy to give you at least nine times what wells fargo does the news isn t much better for credit cards while american express citi and chase shower consumers with bonuses and perks wells fargo plods along with and reward card lineups that do not make the leader board for largess its bankers do this because they can because they relied for years on a pushy sales culture in the branches where even people who actually said yes to the pitches weren t in a position to compare them in the moment so the bank didn t need to have the best products that flair for mediocrity may no longer work consumer credit card applications declined by a stunning 43 percent in december 2016 compared with the same month a year earlier the new wells fargo script might go like this many of our bankers tried to use you in the worst possible way so we get why you re staying away from our cards but now we re going to give more things away to all of you who stay loyal to us in our moment of professed contrition here s one idea for starters given its status as a leader in mortgage lending and servicing the bank ought to double what it pays out on its home rebate signature credit card to people who use the rewards to pay down additional principal on their loans at least 2 percent cash back is a good benchmark clarity in its acquisition of wachovia wells fargo ended up with responsibility for a number of mortgage loans from an outfit called world savings bank many of those loans put borrowers in situations where their payments did not cover all of their interest costs and some of those borrowers did not know it victor amerling who lives in tenafly n j is one borrower who had this kind of negative amortization adjustable rate loan he approached me for help months ago after having no luck getting wells fargo to explain to him how when he explicitly signed up for a biweekly payment program designed to help him and his wife pay off their loan seven years early he ended up in a situation where that will not happen after all his letter from a wells fargo executive resolution specialist did not mention the nature of his loan mr amerling learned of it only after i intervened with the company on his behalf and it disclosed that it had been in negative amortization territory for four years instead the letter said that we are unable to confirm when your loan will mature by making biweekly payments according to the bank that s because the interest rate on his loan adjusts so often that it s impossible to assess though he could refinance if he wanted more certainty in 2000 however world savings had given him a piece of paper showing a 2023 payoff date this was on an ironically termed truth in lending statement mr amerling said they baited me with 23 years and nobody ever mentioned negative amortization to me not my lawyer not the mortgage broker not the bank s lawyer nobody wells fargo did not cause this problem but why hasn t wells fargo been resetting his payments and those of people like him each year to keep them on track toward their goal of paying off their mortgage early vickee adams a spokeswoman said the bank didn t know who was in which payment plan or for what reason some people are in biweekly plans to pair their mortgage payment up with their biweekly paychecks for instance the bank still holds just under 39 billion in outstanding mortgage loans like mr amerling s so a word of warning to anyone there or elsewhere with a mortgage that has an adjustable rate or is even remotely exotic with your bank each and every year to make sure you are on track to pay off the loan on your intended schedule integrity wells fargo would like to help you invest your life savings and it has an army of financial professionals standing by to help but last year three academics issued a working paper that ranked brokerage firms by the percentage of their investment professionals who had at least one black mark on their industry disciplinary records wells fargo advisors financial network was the third worst 15 3 percent of the representatives had say been fired from a previous job for cause settled a consumer dispute in the past or run into a severe financial problem of their own that s more than double the industrywide figure which led the researchers to assume that financial institutions with high percentages were specializing in misconduct this is not a good look for an institution that has also admitted to signing banking customers up for products that they did not need and never asked for wells fargo disputes the misconduct specialization label though we wholeheartedly disagree with that assertion said helen bow a spokeswoman she added that in 2015 434 people applied for affiliation with its network the advisers fly the wells fargo flag and tap into its resources but are not employees just 8 3 percent of them had any sort of disclosure and the bank accepted only 15 of the 434 total applicants that represents real progress one possibility here a public declaration that its goal is to get that misconduct figure under say 4 percent for its advisers good citizenship a bank with the size and resources of wells fargo should be able to innovate when it wants to and there are signs that it can the bank s yourloantracker tool has the potential to help many mortgage applicants know exactly where they are in the process and what paperwork the bank needs is missing or has lost but at a moment when so many americans are ready to turn their backs on elites and their institutions this would be the perfect moment for a large financial services firm to say loudly and proudly that it stands for bringing many more struggling people back into the banking system in her new book the unbanking of america how the new middle class survives lisa servon who worked in the and business as part of her research offers a laundry list of innovations that any bank could adopt wells fargo executives should turn right to chapter 8 to see them there she mentions keybank a regional player with a checking account now known as the account wells fargo has a similar offering that it could build on called opportunity checking but it s harder to avoid fees with that one nobody wants wells fargo to go away affluent people want more choices in financial services and better service and people urgently need them so the bank ought not to run and hide that might be their instinct in the wake of their own crisis to not take any risks and serve the same people in the same way and just try to keep their hands clean ms servon said but they should take some risk with innovation ',\n",

       " ' the best people this refrain rang throughout donald trump s presidential campaign at times it seemed to be his justification for being in the race at all he wasn t a politician he was a businessman he had never run a government but he ran a company and running a company is at bottom easy you get the best people the pitch worked and trump will be sworn in as the 45th president of the united states of america in the meantime he has been stocking his cabinet with what he promises are the best people even without thinking too hard about what best means best for whom to do what it s still instructive to see who made the cut the two people who will be perched on trump s shoulders his chief of staff reince priebus and his chief strategist steve bannon are white men the top layer of his cabinet the attorney general as well as the secretaries of state treasury and defense is made up of white men in fact if you print out a chart with the faces of trump s picks on it the first thing you re likely to notice about it is that his cabinet consists almost entirely of white men and the second thing you re likely to notice is dr ben carson his is a conspicuous face it s black for one which makes it in this cabinet unique it s also famous carson is one of the medical doctors of our time and mounted a presidential run of his own but carson s face seems to be in the wrong place the retired neurosurgeon won t be running say health and human services he ll manage the department of housing and urban development his inclusion is conspicuous for another reason too shortly after the election carson s friend and adviser armstrong williams said that carson wouldn t take a cabinet position because he had no governing experience the last thing he would want to do williams said was take a position that could cripple the presidency it seems very unlikely that a retired neurosurgeon with no governing experience is one of the best people to handle city planning and housing policies so why is he there carson certainly looks like what people might call a token someone admitted into a space dominated by one group mostly to feign inclusivity toward others it feels unkind to actually call him that it s rude messy and dismissive of carson s agency and ability still this administration stands to be mighty white and male and its few women and people of color tend to appear in roles that feel like afterthoughts or stereotypes it s almost funny in its clumsiness nikki haley who has virtually no experience but is the child of indian immigrants will be ambassador to the united nations a black man will oversee housing projects as of late december politico was reporting that trump s staff was scrambling to find a hispanic candidate to head the department of agriculture these appointees may be as accomplished and well qualified as anyone else in trump s cabinet but the stagecraft and typecasting of their appointments are definitely what you might call tokenism writ large and on full public display in 1961 president john f kennedy signed executive order 10925 which expanded on president franklin d roosevelt s order signed 20 years earlier which banned racial discrimination in the federal government and defense industries kennedy ordered that government contractors take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race creed color or national origin three years later the civil rights act of 1964 extended that action to women the civil rights act of 1968 banned housing discrimination by the decade s end there was at least in theory a commitment to include everyone in american life an admission that per federal law if only per federal law women and brown people were full citizens one response was violence where violence was ineffective or unacceptable other forms of resistance had to suffice schools integrated spasmodically often kicking and screaming in court workplaces often didn t many white homeowners and landlords refused to sell or rent to families of color in 1973 in new york president richard nixon s department of justice sued donald trump and his father for refusing to rent to black people that the trumps objected and denied this reflected not just their legal situation but a growing social consensus that things like naked racism and sexism were untoward things few people wanted to be accused of or forced to defend but institutions throughout the nation also found it difficult to stop doing them this is the world that brought us modern american tokenism both as a word and as a practice people concluded that it was easier to fake inclusion than truly include women and people of color the easiest course was to find one person who could serve as a to appear in a classroom or a workplace to signal that everyone was getting a fair shot not only when that was untrue but because it was untrue and needed hiding tokenism is above all a form of misdirection it s the smiling muslim kid on the school brochure the black editorial assistant in the newsroom the telegenic woman serving as a campaign spokeswoman by the television and film had mastered this too dutifully checking off boxes with actors of color whose purpose was mainly to be seen these were minor disposable mascots who played to stereotypes provided shallow comic relief or merely died first to show that others were in danger the obnoxious gay best friend the asexual asian bookworm the west indian nanny this type of character became such an established trope that the adult cartoon south park featured an child actually named token at tokenism s cheapest and laziest a mascot isn t even necessary people counter accusations of racism by pointing to their close but unidentified black friends one october trump rally featured a prominent blacks for trump sign that was held up by an elderly white woman in politics complaints about tokenism come from both sides those on the left accuse the right of using tokens to create the false impression of a diverse dynamic movement that both values and is supported by women and people of color those on the right accuse the left of valuing diversity over quality ticking off racial boxes instead of insisting on merit the defining difference between these analyses is obvious in one the suggestion is that people other than white men are qualified to do important jobs and too seldom get the chance in the other the suggestion is that they often lack merit but are rewarded anyway last month on the fox news program hannity the trump adviser newt gingrich hailed what he saw as trump s dedication to the quality of cabinet appointments over arbitrary diversity this is what leads him to jim mattis gingrich said this is what leads him to rick perry i mean he s going to look for the best to come in it s a piece of what trumpism is as opposed to liberalism which would look for the right token surrogate even if they were incompetent but just one week later gingrich changed his tune there has to be more hispanics in the administration he told politico which later reported that trump s search to fill that department of agriculture slot was extending even to people who were and have no experience in agriculture many white kids grow up learning that they can be anything an astronaut an inventor the president many minorities of a certain age and place kids who grew up before the possibility of a black president were bused up route 295 to johns hopkins university in baltimore on field trips treated to speeches by a renowned neurosurgeon and taught that if they went to class kept their heads in books and got good grades they too could one day be like ben carson i was one of those kids this winter while home for the holidays i searched for his autobiography gifted hands and found it resting on a shelf in my childhood bedroom the big picture another of his books was propped next to it with my little brother s name scrawled inside a unique sort of sadness stirs within me when i watch carson now he is in many ways the best of us yet in the end he s just a tool for someone else i recognize myself in him my scholastic athletic and professional careers have always taken me through spaces in which i m often alone and often the first i ve been called a token more times than i can count i ve been one more times than i cared to a token is always chosen and there is a steady throbbing angst that comes with being chosen over and over again always knowing that on some level my abilities may be ancillary to my appearance how do you know when you re being used as an excuse how can you tell the difference between a new employer who is making earnest steps toward diversity and one who is just trying to cover himself what about the times when you know it s the latter but want the spot or need it or tell yourself that being successful in it will crack the door wider for the next person how do you prove that you belong can you ',\n",
       " 'at a sleepy show last month in the grim basement of the broadway comedy club a midtown spot that feels frozen in time from the 1980s comedy boom julio torres looked at his feet speaking to a small crowd in a near monotone the hardest part about being vegan is the apologies he said to silence people ask if i miss meat or dairy i miss being liked mr torres a millennial comic with a slight build shy persona and a hint of an accent he emigrated from el salvador is better known in alternative spaces than in clubs but this line got a big laugh he raised his blond head and made eye contact before going for the kill i don t miss cheese i miss being asked to do things i miss my friends and family judging by the surroundings you would never know that mr torres is the newest star of saturday night live he has never appeared on the show but if you ve been surprised by incongruously dreamy comedy this season chances are he had something to do with it mr torres who has the same delightfully alien sensibility as his sometimes nickname space prince joined the writing staff in the fall and has already introduced a new style to the show which returns on saturday after a holiday break early in his tenure he wrote a distinctively moody digital short half in spanish starring miranda as a sensitive boy named diego calling his mother in mexico from a telephone booth in a north dakota cornfield describing america with wonder and romance he explains a marshmallow salad with the baffled awe of someone seeing a u f o this monologue played as flashbacks of signs and football players took nostalgic tropes of americana and repurposed them into an immigrant s love letter there were slight homoerotic overtones but not a note of gay panic mr torres with anna drezen also wrote a who s afraid of virginia woolf satire the next week that imagined the sparring partners of that 1962 drama as hamsters trapped in a glass box one week later he returned to highbrow animals in a digital short released online that imagined what a swan inside a motel painting would say if he could talk turns out he would harass the duck nearby have you inspired countless ballets said the swan voiced by dave chappelle what was it called he asked adding it wasn t called duck lake this rarefied comedy stands out on a show that has long had a populist voice leaning toward topical jokes and broadly accessible references but mr torres s approach is also not entirely successful often more interesting than funny then again he was just getting started much of his comedy on saturday night live hinges on empathetic shifts in perspective showing us the roiling inner life of an animal an object as in a sketch from the point of view of a sink having an existential crisis or a person not known for introspection his first real triumph was another surprising immigrant story melania s moments a series of digital shorts that detailed the thoughts of the future first lady in a concise form that resembles the mellow from the s n l writer jack handey s deep thoughts mr handey aimed for pure absurdity but mr torres makes melania trump a tragic heroine trapped in her gilded cage approaching a window in trump tower like a cursed princess she gazes onto fifth avenue wondering about sixth avenue the way a chekhov character dreams of moscow in another short she wakes up in a cold sweat with the sense that her replacement is being born in rural latvia then decides to protect her even though the writing staffs of saturday night live have been as rich in talent as the casts the star system has always worked only for those on camera performers became famous while writers even those like james downey who defined political humor for a generation toiled in relative obscurity partly because the show never revealed who was responsible for which sketch mr handey was an exception but this has been changing the john mulaney has gained more than a little acclaim for writing jokes for the popular character stefon played by bill hader who has given him credit in interviews comedy journalism online now covers writers rooms obsessively and social media has also made the artistic process more transparent with comics praising specific sketches new york comedy fans were already familiar with mr torres who appeared on louis c k s horace and pete when he got the job but he didn t emerge from the usual clubs or improv factories the buzz over his work grew in december when he wrote two superb bits with jeremy beiler digital shorts that earned laughs as much as knowing nods their sly ad for a new toy for sensitive lonely boys wells for boys uses a classic s n l format the ad satire for an arch idea that the delicate child s version of a monster truck is a plastic well to sit near and brood but mr torres and mr beiler delivered an even more impressive feat with the formally clever but also topical companion to melania s moments that was presented from the point of view of donald j trump we now spend so much time looking at mr trump that putting us behind his eyes was a fertile concept this short has a paranoid vibe out of rosemary s baby but like all of mr torres s sketches it has a tone that s sneakily sympathetic mr trump played by john cena doesn t appear to be having any more fun than his wife does in melania s moments television blares insults about him his handlers work him over and his voters and colleagues bore him with tedium about politics and policy then comes relief and the punch line in the form of kellyanne conway played by kate mckinnon who hypnotically encourages him to sleep mr trump dreams of a version of himself embracing him and declaring his love then the two donald trumps twirl together this danse macabre is a study in but it also proposes an idea that is not only characteristic of mr torres s work but also helps explain how he has successfully translated his idiosyncratic vision for a broad audience never underestimate people s capacity to see themselves as outsiders because in our own minds we all at some point see ourselves a bit as space princes ',\n",

he could have done a better job instead of pointing blame instead of saying we need to educate people on how to behave when they re being pulled over by the police i m seeing a barrage of patients coming in from different countries an iraqi immigrant came in last night he needs dialysis he will never be productive in the u s he will always be dependent on medicaid i feel for him i want to help

such potential and i truly believe he cares about our country and wants to help everyone i do read things on occasion that he tweets and i think oh my word i wish i could have had 10 minutes with him listen donald you need to straighten up and stop with this foolishness what he said about women was disrespectful but i don t get offended like some people do you get through the bad and you focus on the good basically these were our choices and i felt he was the better choice and i had to overlook the negatives and focus on the positives at the very beginning of this election i was leaning toward bernie sanders i looked at all the candidates what were their ideas to help our country out of debt and make our military strong and be there for our vets i have so many friends whose health care

to the automotive industry i m super excited about trump i believe he knows how to build things my dad worked at a coal power plant for 39 years and they re freaked out about energy changing too quickly i m also concerned about immigration i went to minnesota and i had a somali cabdriver who lectured me for 35 minutes to the airport about how women in america have too much freedom my thought

before many women in the field when the economy started faltering she went from a very high position at pratt whitney to being unemployed for a year and that was heartbreaking i think that trump really cares about having jobs back here not necessarily the service industry do i think trump s trying to send women back to the kitchen no his daughter is a great example she ran the campaign long before he ran for president voter robin mueller 42 preschool teacher home sterling heights mich i made up my mind for trump at the last minute since my husband is in the military i was concerned about

talked me into taking him to a trump rally i expected him to be like what i d seen on the news saying hateful things but his presence was very calming and i liked his talking points we really are the middle class and we kind of get swept aside the first time she ran against obama i was all on board for hillary clinton i really wanted to have a female president i think that s important but i m not sure that s her in the past her stance on abortion was more the way i feel just for the first trimester then she did a 360 she was here in the primary having a debate with bernie sanders he answered the question honestly when they asked her the same question she kind of danced around it then she went on the view and said she was for abortions just take a stance be honest same thing as with gay marriage she wasn t for it then she was i m 100 percent for it it s ridiculous the way we tell people who they can and cannot marry don t go back and forth don t pander i voted for obama the last time

that fear for their way of life from what i understand he says he s not going to mess with that somebody called me a racist because i did vote for trump hold on you don t know me doesn t that make you

worry about going to the movie theater or the mall let s be on the offensive versus the defensive we are a country based on immigrants but i believe they should go through the process my came here

people out there who shouldn t be helped i worked in the inner cities they re on welfare they make a certain amount of money and everything gets taken away that amount of money is so low that they

chattanooga tenn i voted for trump because i wanted change i feel like our economy has totally tanked people do not have disposable income i feel the last eight years have been a joke obama was out for himself i don t think he really respected the office i think it was more about him being a celebrity than a president trump s a successful businessman and i feel like that s what america needs to bring our economy back i don t think donald trump is really republican to be quite honest with you he s not in a box one of the most attractive things to me is he can t be boxed he wants to bring

only have kept his mouth shut during the primary about the way people looked about their size really about mccain i mean really all of it was so egregious i hated it i cringed all of that was bad but it didn t stop me and it s like hillary has the right to talk about trump when she stayed with a guy who was in the white house and took advantage of a young intern why would you stay with him benghazi the emails the i r s she s a liar the clintons got wealthy because of their position i d rather have someone there who doesn t need the money he s got a message he s going to make a change

two evils i had major issues with hillary as far as ethics was concerned it seems she feels that she is above the law and nothing ever seems to stick i didn t particularly like everything he was saying as far as building a wall and doing this to immigrants i looked at that more as bravado his audience needed that to get the applause but there are allegations about killing people who get in her way vince foster people like that someone who has a big bravado is not as concerning to me as someone who might kill people who get in her way voter kasia riddle 43 substitute teacher home

muslim immigrant from turkey he went through the process i don t agree with a ban on muslims but my father was very wary of muslims who came over if they didn t have a reason to be here he would support a full vetting but not a total ban i have always considered myself a feminist for me i want to be treated the exact same way that s not the feel i get from feminists today they want extra privileges i gave up my first marriage so i could be a law partner and then i had to give up on my partnership so i could be a better mom to say women are going backwards would be wrong look at how much trump hires women how much he does rely on women how much he relies on his own daughter i m sort of amazed by her she may pull him more into the middle she ll be a good voice for women ',\n",

       " 'washington america s intelligence chiefs sat down with members of congress behind closed doors on friday for what they thought would be a straightforward briefing on russian cyberattacks what ensued instead was a confrontation democrats have long sought with james b comey the director of the federal bureau of investigation why the house democrats demanded to know did mr comey believe it was o k to make repeated disclosures during the campaign about the investigation into hillary clinton s emails but to this day refuse to say if the f b i is investigating links between the trump campaign and russia his answers did not prove very satisfying representative nancy pelosi of california the minority leader grew so frustrated that at one point she chastised mr comey for being condescending to members representative debbie wasserman schultz of florida who was chairwoman of the democratic national committee when it was hacked asked why mr comey had never called her about the intrusions which began in august 2015 and continued over the course of many months the f b i notified the committee of the original hacking but reached a tech support contractor and went back and forth with him for months before the leadership of the organization was informed and took steps to halt the intrusion the committee and the bureau have blamed each other for the delay and the pattern continued on friday according to multiple democrats in the meeting afterward representative adam b schiff democrat of california called the tenor of the exchanges contentious at times i don t want to go into the contents of what were discussed mr schiff said but a great many members are concerned with whether the director has employed a double standard the hearing took place a day after the justice department s inspector general said it was investigating mr comey s decision during the campaign to hold a news conference announcing the end of the case and then just before the election inform congress there was possible new evidence only to say days later that it did not amount to anything mr comey didn t really answer said representative jerrold nadler of new york he dismissively referred to mr comey as a policeman and added i don t remember anything substantive he said the reaction to the assessment by intelligence agencies that russia sought to promote the candidacy of donald j trump has been mixed mr trump has seen it as undermining his electoral victory and ridiculed the agencies accusing them this week of using leaks to discredit him after it briefed him on a dossier of unsubstantiated reports of compromising personal information the russians allegedly collected but on friday senator richard m burr of north carolina the chairman of the intelligence committee and the panel s vice chairman senator mark warner democrat of virginia announced that the committee would hold hearings on the russian activity and its effect on the election before russians were an issue there was the f b i investigation into whether mrs clinton or her aides mishandled classified information that was in emails on a private server she was using mr comey discussed the investigation and sharply criticized mrs clinton at a news conference announcing that no charges would be brought against her he also wrote two letters near the end of the campaign that clinton supporters say cost her the election but mr comey has not publicly commented on whether there are any open investigations of mr trump or anyone associated with his campaign democrats said the closest mr comey came on friday to offering an explanation for his actions was to say he would only disclose an ongoing investigation if the public had an overwhelming need to know about it or if it was obvious there was one underway he said he did not believe any possible investigation into trump or his associates met either standard the f b i s position is that it does not discuss counterintelligence investigations that could compromise important methods and sources speaking to reporters afterward ms pelosi said that really the american people are owed the truth there is a great deal of evidence to say that this is an issue of high interest to the american people she continued for that reason the f b i should let us know whether they re doing that investigation or not they re usually inscrutable the f b i declined to comment on the meeting mr nadler said he thought mr comey should have been fired months ago other democrats perhaps concerned about who mr trump would name to replace mr comey either said that he should remain on the job or that they were still unsure the meeting in the auditorium of the capitol s visitor center was standing room only some republicans unsurprisingly had a different reaction their questions and comments seemed to make the case that hillary clinton would be president if it were not for hacking representative steve king of iowa said mr king left the meeting unconvinced about the russian hacking which the intelligence chiefs did manage to discuss amid the questions about mr comey s conduct the congressman added that he thought some intelligence officials were trustworthy but not all people there need to be rooted out he said without elaborating ',\n",

       " 'looking to the federal government to rein in police excesses can be an exercise in managed expectations on friday chicago agreed to revamp its police department after the justice department found routine use of excessive force and the mayor said he would negotiate a settlement known as a consent decree but that is no guarantee of results and not just because the man most likely to be the next attorney general has said he is skeptical of such endeavors attempts to force change in police departments have met with mixed success even under the obama administration which made police reform a signature issue it has opened 25 investigations into law enforcement agencies over issues like excessive force racial bias and poor supervision issuing reports choking with outrage los angeles which was under a consent decree for 11 years is regarded as one of the great success stories los angeles is a different place today because of the consent decree and the leadership of the department said chuck wexler the executive director of the police executive research forum a washington think tank in detroit which emerged from a consent decree last year officer shootings and warrantless arrests have declined significantly but pittsburgh the target of the first consent decree based on a justice department finding of a pattern and practice of misconduct later backslid after changes in leadership said samuel walker a criminal justice professor at the university of nebraska at omaha and while miami reduced police shootings to zero for 20 months after a federal investigation in 2002 that was later closed with no settlement the justice department in 2013 reinvestigated and found a pattern of excessive force with firearms underscoring some experts view that consent decrees or other settlements are needed for enduring improvements last year miami settled the 2013 inquiry by agreeing to improve supervision training and internal investigations the pattern and practice approach developed after the rodney king beating in los angeles in 1991 forced a period of national introspection over how to curb misconduct if individual officers could not be held accountable a jury s decision not to convict the four officers charged in the attack on mr king incited deadly riots since the early attempts mr walker said consent decrees have evolved to be more sophisticated and comprehensive the general pattern is that there is some backsliding on some issues he said but i don t think there s a case where a department has completely collapsed back to where it was before still senator jeff sessions republican of alabama and the nominee for attorney general under donald j trump called them dangerous writing in 2008 that they constitute an end run around the democratic process at his confirmation hearing this past week he softened that critique saying there were some circumstances that legitimately demanded consent decrees and that those already in place would be enforced but mr sessions said lawsuits could unfairly target whole police departments for the misdeeds of a few bad actors these lawsuits undermine the respect for police officers and create an impression that the entire department is not doing their work consistent with fidelity to law and fairness he said his critique did not extend to how well consent decrees actually work but experts say that even systemic changes like greater oversight of officers use of force can be slow to yield results they change the inputs through training record keeping community involvement and other internal reforms but the inputs don t necessarily translate into changes in outputs including racial disparities use of force or other constitutional issues wrote jeff fagan a columbia university law professor in an email the results have been quite variable consent decrees can span years and many of the obama administration s key settlements have just begun including those in cleveland and albuquerque so it would be premature to assess their success some reform advocates have expressed fears that the trump administration will fail to investigate police departments or enforce consent decrees robbing them of what they view as a crucial lever to compel change even some police chiefs might mourn a retreat from consent decrees baltimore s police commissioner kevin davis has said that a consent decree would aid community relations charles h ramsey who as washington s police chief invited the justice department to review his department said the doj gives legitimacy to the changes that you re making chiefs may want consent decrees in order to insulate them from political and union opposition to change as well as make it easier to demand money to pay for reforms mr sessions wrote in his critique of consent decrees in 2008 that he is aware of that strategy such decrees are particularly offensive when certain governmental agencies secretly delight in being sued because they hope a settlement will be reached resulting in the agency receiving more money he wrote thus the taxpayers ultimately fund the settlement enacted through this undemocratic process ',\n",
       " 'washington only weeks after 70 million americans chose a black man for president shattering a racial barrier that had stood for the entirety of the nation s history no one in the white house especially the man in the oval office wanted to talk about race president obama had made a pragmatic calculation in january 2009 as the financial crisis drove communities across the united states toward economic collapse whatever he did for whose neighborhoods were suffering more than others he would not describe as efforts to specifically help black america mr obama made the decision knowing how powerfully his election had raised the hopes of and knowing that no matter what he did it would not be seen as enough i remember thinking they are going to hate us one day said melody barnes who is black and served as mr obama s first domestic policy adviser recalling her sadness when she stood in an auditorium in those early months as a crowd cheered for the success of the new president i knew that we couldn t do everything that people wanted to meet those expectations the fear inside the west wing was that promoting a black agenda and aiming programs directly at at a time of widespread economic anxiety would provoke a white backlash the kind that years later white house officials would view as helping to elect donald j trump at a minimum that would have been tone deaf said eric h holder jr who served as the nation s first attorney general during much of mr obama s presidency and at worst would have created a reaction in the larger community that would have prevented the things you wanted to do mr obama who had grown up straddling two worlds as the son of a black man from kenya and a white woman from kansas wanted to be the president of all america framing his efforts in racial terms could exacerbate something that was already simmering he thought the most important thing i can do is to lift the economy over all mr obama told reporters in the summer of 2009 when he was asked about doing more to help recover economically but over the next seven and a half years racial tensions across the country forced mr obama to abandon his early reticence on race again and again ultimately he led a national conversation on race ignited by spasms of violence police shootings and protests in florida south carolina missouri and elsewhere inside the white house aides recall them as among his most painful moments as president after my election there was talk of a america mr obama said in his farewell speech on tuesday in chicago reflecting on the threat that racial strife poses for the country s democratic ideals such a vision however well intended was never realistic race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society after he leaves office mr obama will continue that conversation in work for my brother s keeper and other programs to help black youths there is plenty to do as much as his presidency has inspired and empowered black unemployment is still about double that for whites nearly a quarter of blacks are living in poverty almost the same as in 1976 he made it seem like everything was all good and it s not said thelonious stokes 21 a black artist whose experiences of being racially profiled in chicago left him jaded about the state of race relations we almost needed trump to show the true state of america mr obama s earliest public reflection about race as president backfired asked about a black harvard professor henry louis gates jr a friend of mr obama s who was arrested in july 2009 trying to enter his own house by a white officer mr obama immediately took sides it is fair to say the president said six days after the arrest at a news conference that the cambridge police acted stupidly those words and the frenzied reaction to them helped deepen the caution about racial issues inside the white house for days the president s critique of the arresting officer dominated the news and the morning staff meetings in the west wing robert gibbs the press secretary was especially agitated his colleagues recalled and argued that the white house had to do something to change the subject mr gibbs succeeded in pushing for what the news media quickly labeled a beer summit on the edge of the rose garden in the white house where mr gates and the arresting officer sgt james crowley joined mr obama over beer for a discussion it had to be cauterized in a way that it would stop leading the news valerie jarrett mr obama s closest adviser conceded professor gates for one was pleased i don t think anybody but barack obama would have thought about bringing us together he said at the time as a candidate for president in 2008 mr obama had drawn praise for confronting racial divisions during a powerful speech he delivered about his former pastor the rev jeremiah a wright jr who had characterized the united states as fundamentally racist and the government as corrupt the profound mistake of reverend wright s sermons is not that he spoke about racism in our society it s that he spoke as if our society was static as if no progress had been made mr obama said that march day in philadelphia urging people to move beyond old racial wounds let us be our brother s keeper scripture tells us let us be our sister s keeper let us find that common stake we all have in one another and let our politics reflect that spirit as well but the beer summit was deeply disturbing to many of the president s advisers who thought he should not have backed down the officer had acted stupidly they thought and the nation s first black president ought to be able to say so the meeting was demeaning and diminished his leadership and his voice at that moment one of them recalled asking for anonymity to bluntly discuss the topic people thought we were being punked i got so many emails so many phone calls from people i respected he was right why are you backpedaling inside the west wing the impact was clear mr obama would have to be more cautious when it came to racial issues particularly ahead of the 2012 campaign the issue of race was too divisive at a time when mr obama needed to emphasize inclusion what it did teach us is that you just have to be careful about the words that you choose ms jarrett said it doesn t mean you shy away from issues that arise that deal with race just as he didn t shy away from reverend wright but you have to be sensitive to a long history of people reacting strongly to the topic outside the white house people noticed too he plainly arrested him because he was black said edward g robinson sr who is black and works at a box factory in cleveland mr obama backtracked because he wanted to be everybody s president like others mr robinson said the president was met with racially motivated disrespect in washington and pointed to the moment when a white republican lawmaker yelled you lie at the president during a congressional address the white house would go on to publish reports about its efforts to help including details about the impact that the affordable care act was having to help poor blacks but mr obama rarely talked about race publicly during the next few years the president s voice was shaking with emotion if i had a son he would look like trayvon martin mr obama told ms jarrett and david plouffe his senior adviser and former campaign manager as the three talked in the oval office about what the president should say publicly about the death of the at the hands of a neighborhood watch volunteer in florida i am going to say that it was march 2012 nearly three years after the beer summit the specter of that meeting still hovered and mr obama was in a sense taking sides again but in personalizing the shooting his aides recalled mr obama s hope was that people might view boys differently if they saw trayvon through the president s own eyes mr obama headed out to the rose garden announced his nomination of a new world bank president then took the question from a reporter that everyone knew was coming can you comment on the trayvon martin case sir mr obama called it a tragedy said he was glad the justice department was looking into it reflected on how the nation was doing necessary soul searching and then concluded but my main message is to the parents of trayvon martin if i had a son he d look like trayvon moments after mr obama returned to the oval office gene sperling one of his top economic advisers stopped by with tears in his eyes you can t imagine what that will mean to my son mr sperling who is white and is married to an woman told the president according to a colleague who was there at the time this time the president s comments were embraced by many outside the white house too media reports focused on the emotion mr obama had displayed rare for a politician whose usual demeanor was cool and professorial for him to say things like that in front of the entire country and the world i think sends a strong message to people ryan shultz 33 an art teacher in chicago who is white said in a recent interview but others viewed the president s comments that day as a continuing affront to police officers and a saw in them a willingness to take sides in the racial debate for at least one person it went further dylann s roof the white supremacist who killed nine parishioners in charleston s c in 2015 later said he was inspired to kill because of media coverage of trayvon s shooting crime is still bad and police are still shooting black people left and right mr shultz said i live in chicago a murder capital of the united states and it s crazy and it hasn t gotten that much better i don t think michael brown an unarmed black teenager was shot and killed by darren wilson a white police officer in ferguson mo shortly after noon on aug 9 2014 only minutes before mr obama had arrived on martha s vineyard for his summer vacation which would soon be dominated by how to respond to the racial violence that mr brown s death unleashed the president and his aides including mr holder and ms jarrett who were also vacationing on the island made urgent calls to missouri s governor state police officials and civil rights leaders they debated whether mr obama should go to ferguson and decided against it knowing that a presidential visit would be disruptive mr holder would go instead but the more urgent question for the three of them was how to weigh in the president was wary of putting his thumb on the scale in a case destined to be investigated by the federal authorities but it was just as clear that tensions between the police and were increasing not only in ferguson but also around the country if mr obama wasn t the right person to step into that issue who was you want to try to calm the situation mr holder said recalling the discussions he had with the president and ms jarrett about what to say you want to reassure the community that an investigation will be done and done fully but you want to make sure that the people in law enforcement know it is done fairly there was that trust gap he added that was something that had to be dealt with as the violence worsened mr holder mr obama and ms jarrett concluded that the president needed to denounce the violence and at the same time criticize the police for their conduct during the protests there is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting the president said in a televised statement on aug 14 from edgartown mass but he added there s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their first amendment rights for the rest of his presidency mr obama would strive for the balance he struck in his remarks that day empathy and understanding for and support for the police and the rule of law but however he weighed in the events in ferguson made clear that he could no longer hang back and instead had to lead a national debate about race violence and unity once it was so in america s face police brutality it blew the circuit said bill burton an who served as deputy white house press secretary during the first term it made it possible to have that conversation that our country had actively not been having inevitably mr obama s striving for balance often left him vilified by both sides jim pasco the executive director of the fraternal order of police rebuked mr obama for not being helpful in discussing police tactics from his vacation years later mr pasco told npr that the president often struck the wrong tone when he talked about race and policing the president has never been a police officer he s never walked in a police officer s shoes mr pasco said last july there s kind of a breakdown in communication more than there is a breakdown in insincerity or intent ja mal green a black lives matter activist based in chicago said he thought mr obama ignored the calls of organizers for federal policy and funding aimed at stopping police brutality mr green said he also grew tired of hearing mr obama couple his grief for families in racially charged shooting episodes with statements supporting white police officers he is trying to walk a neutral line and he wants to please both sides mr green said he wants to please black people and then he wants to please police supporters and police officers and police unions but sometimes you have to pick a side in situations you need to pick your time when you fight for home or you ll just have everybody hating you mr stokes the artist from chicago felt similarly disappointed chicago is the exact same mr stokes said he simply opened up maybe a lane for young men like me to just maybe be accepted a little bit more to people that don t accept educated black people but that s it literally white america is still running everything and that means that nothing is changing less than a year after mr brown s death in ferguson on june 17 2015 nine parishioners including a pastor were gunned down by a white supremacist during a church meeting in charleston two days later the victims families addressed mr roof the gunman at a court hearing where one by one they forgave him you took something very precious away from me nadine collier the daughter of ethel lance told mr roof as her voice rose in anguish i will never talk to her ever again i will never be able to hold her again but i forgive you and have mercy on your soul it was an extraordinary scene broadcast live on television which moved many who saw it to tears mr obama was traveling and did not see it in real time but when eric schultz the deputy press secretary read ms collier s words out loud to mr obama on marine one the presidential helicopter the president was awed by what he heard he said that s what we need to recognize here the ability of people to forgive on the worst day of their lives it really struck him ms jarrett recalled we sat there and talked about it on the helicopter about that quality the amazing grace later in the oval office mr obama struggled with his chief speechwriter cody keenan to come up with the right words for a eulogy for the rev clementa c pinckney the pastor of the charleston church and a friend of the president s i ve got nothing to say mr keenan told mr obama according to ms jarrett you ve said everything that one could possibly say on the subject eventually the president decided that instead of talking about guns he would talk about what black churches stood for and the meaning of grace it would be a betrayal of everything reverend pinckney stood for i believe if we allowed ourselves to slip into a comfortable silence again the president told a hushed audience at the memorial service once the eulogies have been delivered once the tv cameras move on to go back to business as usual that s what we so often do to avoid uncomfortable truths about the prejudice that still infects our society to settle for symbolic gestures without following up with the hard work of more lasting change that s how we lose our way again the week before during a podcast interview with marc maron the comedian mr obama had caused a minor stir by using the word nigger in answering a question about race relations he knew it would cause a ripple an aide with him recalled but he shrugged at the beginning of his term the podcast could have caused a fury and mr obama might have pulled back again but events in the country especially the deaths of young black men had given him more opportunities to engage the topic mr pinckney s funeral was one of them he s not going to just whistle in the wind ms jarrett said he s looking for a chance to talk to people when they are ready to hear him he doesn t ignore moments one of those moments came this past may mr obama had a little more than eight months left in office and he had already said plenty about race but as he headed to deliver the 2016 commencement address at howard university the historically black college in washington mr obama said he had something he wanted to add it was a message to young the ones who wanted to protest the injustices they saw around them the president had invited some of them to the white house to talk with him about their cause and in a few cases they refused the invitation people close to him said that made him burn you can be completely right and you still are going to have to engage folks who disagree with you mr obama told the students that day speaking more to members of the black lives matter movement than to the graduates before him being as uncompromising as possible you will feel good about yourself you will enjoy a certain moral purity but you re not going to get what you want for the president a onetime community organizer in chicago it was a crucial distinction mr obama had tilted against the powerful and connected he called his time as an organizer the best education i ever had better than anything i got at harvard law school his approach had always been more strategic than confrontational and foreshadowed his cautious meticulous attitude in the white house in the speech mr obama recalled working as a young illinois state senator to fight racial profiling not by calling the police racist but by sitting down and negotiating a new law so we engaged and we listened and we kept working until we built consensus he said by the time he became president people close to mr obama said he was frustrated by the idea that young activists would view themselves as tainted if they came into the white house to talk to him in the speech he urged the young protesters not to give in to the idea that the system is rigged that will lead to more cynicism and less participation and a downward spiral of more injustice and more anger and more despair he said and that s never been the source of our progress that s how we cheat ourselves of progress listen he told the students engage if the other side has a point learn from them if they re wrong rebut them teach them mr obama has told people that he avoided framing his early white house efforts in overtly racial terms because he wanted to avoid a white backlash but acknowledges that he got one anyway still the president repeatedly tells crowds like the students at howard that race relations are better since he graduated from college to deny how far we ve come would do a disservice to the cause of justice to the legions of foot soldiers he told them last may two days after the 2016 election mr obama took his own advice about engaging adversaries by sitting down in the oval office for 90 minutes with mr trump many in his party were still in shock about the election s results and wanted to see fury from their president instead he offered a hand in atlanta latonda henderson a marketing consultant watched mr obama s meeting with mr trump with admiration as the president she loved sat down with the man who had led the movement questioning the legitimacy of his birth certificate you sit down with people who opposed you said ms henderson who is black you sit down and try to find a common ground with people who were attacking your family spitting on your family that s president obama s legacy ',\n",

       " 'chengdu china mao once said that a revolution was not a dinner party but with the communist revolution turning into opulent capitalism china s rich are now making sure the dinner party settings are immaculate and the wine is poured just right inspired in part by the downton abbey television drama the country s once raw and raucous tycoons are aspiring to decorum fueling demand for the services of homegrown butlers trained in the ways of a british manor what they would like to say to their friends is look i have a butler an butler in my home to show how wealthy they are said neal yeh a briton living in beijing who for over a decade has helped train and find jobs for butlers the country now with the biggest trend in butlers is china said mr yeh whose english accent would be at home on downton abbey the television series about a blue blood family in england which was avidly watched in china i dare say i have played a part in starting this trend butler training schools and agencies have been doing business in china for more than a decade but the number of recruits has grown sharply in recent years according to those in the business most are chinese and many are women the international butler academy china opened in 2014 here in chengdu a city in southwest china and offers a boot camp on dinner service managing homes and other minutiae of high living the chinese are vacationing more now than ever in history and so they re being exposed to the west more and more said christopher noble an american trainer at the academy who previously ran bars in cleveland but chinese people see that experience personal service abroad and they want to experience it here a boom in butler service might seem incongruous as president xi jinping campaigns zealously against corruption and extravagance and an economic slowdown undercuts lavish spending but china s rich continue amassing ever greater fortunes and want what they see as the trappings of respectable refinement even under mr xi butlers are finding growing work as symbols of good taste according to people in the business you read about an economic slowdown but china s wealth is still growing said luo jinhuan who has worked as a butler in shanghai and most recently beijing after learning the job in holland old money has passed from one generation to the next but the new money doesn t have the same quality you need to help them improve if butlers symbolize maturing chinese capitalism the somewhat awkward status they have here also reflects how the rich in china must play by different rules than the wealthy in many other countries it often comes down to a lack of trust wealth in china where a cutthroat business culture is pervasive comes with insecurity about being brought low by resentful employees rivals and officials especially with the continuing crackdown against corruption that wariness discourages many millionaires from hiring their own jeeves to run their homes people in the business said some of them discover that in reality they can t trust an outsider to manage the household said tang yang a marketing director at the butler academy they re unwilling to have a butler who knows all the information about the family relatively few graduates of the academy end up as traditional household butlers instead many work in clubs housing estates and executive floors serving several clients at the same time not with the same intimacy as a personal butler promoters of butlers in china often point out that the country has its own tradition of service and the classical chinese novel dream of the red chamber features traditional butlers called guanjia or domestic manager in mandarin but downton abbey helped rekindle a new romanticized interest in service in china many student butlers here said they had watched and rewatched the show as an instruction video on the unflappability of domestic service i only began to grasp this profession of butlers after watching downton abbey said xu shitao a beijing native studying at the chengdu academy i think that in the future this profession will be quite popular and will have a market but ms xu and her classmates have found that in reality being a butler is strenuous work on a recent morning they practiced for hours learning to serve wine and water the proper way again and again the class of eight clasped a wine bottle near its bottom and stepped forward in unison around a dinner table to dispense just enough wine to reach the widest part of a wine glass not a drop was to splash the tablecloth or heaven forbid a guest stretch pour up twist back wipe try to extend your arm mr noble commanded using his translator you want to be able to extend your arm as much as possible you re doing a ballet students also take classes on serving formal dinners packing luggage cleaning house and countless other details of managing life for the rich you have to get the details right to do your job right said yang linjun a student in the class your arms get sore and your hands hurt but this is a lifestyle after they graduate many hope to attach themselves to china s growing number of superrich in return they may earn monthly wages of 2 800 or much higher as personal butlers depending on experience and luck more than for many service jobs by 2015 china had 400 billionaires and billionaire families an increase of 65 from just a year earlier according to forbes annual list the country s richest 1 percent own about of household wealth a share similar to the concentration of wealth in america manners can be rough in china sometimes in a warm way sometimes less so but that has been changing as people grow richer travel and live abroad and bring back a demand for polished attentive service a decade ago very few chinese people stayed in hotels said yang kaojun a property manager with the summit group which employs teams of trained butlers who are at the beck and call of residents but now many people have and that s given them some understanding of what good service is as well as the chengdu academy the sanda university a private college in shanghai has incorporated butler training into its hospitality program many chinese also learn how to be butlers in europe and sara vestin rahmani the founder of the bespoke bureau a british company that finds domestic staff members for wealthy employers said her company planned to open a school for butlers and domestic staff people in china this year the number of butlers in china is hard to determine there may be hundreds or thousands especially in beijing shanghai and the prosperous south ms rahmani said that in 2007 her company found positions in china for 20 butlers by 2015 that number had grown to 375 including 125 with families others reported similar growth we are in actual fact exporting to china a trade which was once their own ms rahmani said with communism everything that was refined unique and became a distant memory but chinese employers often treat butlers as expensive flunkies who should be on call 24 hours a day that violated the traditional idea of a butler as a respected manager of the household and above most menial tasks ms luo the butler said her work was far more hectic than she imagined her daily routine included overseeing the sauna cinema bowling alley and other rooms in a home i feel that when work starts there s no time at all to stop and rest she said it s a lot harder than working in a hotel the pressure is compounded by employers fears that household servants could exploit sensitive information butlers are supposed to have a deep knowledge of their employers every foible traditionally recorded in a book but the worry that information could be used to rob extort or prosecute them has discouraged many rich people from taking butlers into their confidence many of our wealthy are the first generation to be rich and they don t have a long accumulation of family history said mr yang the student at the butler academy in chengdu who works for a real estate company you need trust and a long period of adjustment to have another person suddenly by your side

business of launching satellites to orbit but financial details disclosed this past week about the company overshadowed the successful liftoff raising questions about the viability of mr musk s plans for spacex and his vision of sending people to mars spacex based in hawthorne calif has been set back since september when a different falcon 9 caught fire and exploded on a launchpad in florida destroying the rocket and its payload a 200 million israeli satellite that facebook had planned to lease to expand global internet services the company s rockets had been grounded since then an internal investigation concluded that a failure of a helium vessel in the second stage liquid oxygen tank had led to the conflagration the federal aviation administration which regulates commercial space launches accepted spacex s report on the explosion s causes on jan 6 and issued a launch license clearing the way for saturday s liftoff here on the other side of the country to prevent a recurrence spacex adjusted its fueling procedures to avoid overcooling of the helium saturday s countdown proceeded smoothly with the liftoff occurring within a window that would send the rocket on a trajectory to line up with the orbit of a group of current iridium communications satellites the new satellites are more powerful than the original ones which have been in orbit nearly two decades and have outlived their designed lifetimes spacex also repeated its feat of recovering the first stage of the falcon 9 rocket landing it on a floating platform named just read the instructions in the pacific less than 90 minutes later mission control received confirmation that all 10 satellites had been successfully deployed over the next 14 months the company plans six additional falcon 9 launches to deploy 60 more iridium satellites that will completely replace the constellation in the the successful launch helps put spacex back on track the explosion and subsequent grounding created a backlog of launches including cargo missions for nasa to the international space station september s explosion was spacex s second failure in 15 months a falcon 9 rocket carrying nasa cargo disintegrated in flight in june 2015 on friday the wall street journal reported that spacex had lost 260 million in 2015 after the earlier accident and revenue dropped 6 percent to 945 million in earlier years spacex officials including mr musk described the company as consistently profitable that claim has been removed from spacex s website company officials did not dispute the numbers

customer relationships and more than 70 future launches on our manifest representing over 10 billion in contracts bret johnsen spacex s chief financial officer said in a statement furthermore with over 1 billion in cash reserves and no debt the company is in a financially strong position and is well positioned for future growth spacex hopes to launch its larger falcon heavy this spring the heavy years behind schedule would become the world s most powerful rocket since nasa retired the saturn 5 more than 40 years ago spacex also plans to refly one of its recovered boosters this spring by reusing instead of throwing away rocket boosters spacex hopes to significantly reduce the cost of launches also on the schedule is an abort test of spacex s dragon 2 capsule a crucial safety prerequisite that it must conduct before the company can begin ferrying nasa astronauts to the space station next year by applying silicon valley entrepreneurial practices to aerospace spacex has undercut prices and disrupted the rocket launch business that brought in many customers like iridium which is paying more than 450 million for the seven launches the bid from one of spacex s competitors was 1 2 billion said matthew j desch iridium s chief executive without spacex s lower costs iridium could not have afforded to replace its group of satellites mr desch said the falcon 9 is perfect for what we want to do he said but the lower costs make it difficult to see how spacex could earn enough profit to finance its grand ambitions in september mr musk unveiled his vision for what he called the interplanetary transport system a gigantic rocket with 42 engines that could take 100 passengers to mars as early as 2024 spacex has described plans to offer satellite internet services with more than 4 000 satellites the forecasts described by the wall street journal which were produced in early 2016 show how much the company is depending on this new business spacex projected that current rocket launching business would quintuple in revenue to 5 billion in 2025 satellite internet services still in the early planning stages were projected to bring in more than 30 billion in revenue and generate the bulk of more than 20 billion in profit for the company during the september announcement mr musk spoke of a huge partnership to get to mars but did not describe what kind of partnership he foresaw the incoming trump administration has not outlined in detail its plans for nasa although some of the s advisers including newt gingrich are pushing for a greater reliance on commercial companies like spacex other republicans however have been strong defenders of the space launch system the big expensive rocket that nasa is developing for a mars mission ',\n",
       " 'what do households on food stamps buy at the grocery store the answer was largely a mystery until now the united states department of agriculture which oversees the 74 billion food stamp program called snap has published a detailed report that provides a glimpse into the shopping cart of the typical household that receives food stamps the findings show that the no 1 purchases by snap households are soft drinks which accounted for 5 percent of the dollars they spent on food the category of sweetened beverages which includes soft drinks fruit juices energy drinks and sweetened teas accounted for almost 10 percent of the dollars they spent on food in this sense snap is a taxpayer subsidy of the soda industry said marion nestle a professor of nutrition food studies and public health at new york university it s pretty shocking for years dozens of cities states and medical groups have urged changes to snap or the supplemental nutrition assistance program to help improve nutrition among the 43 million poorest americans who receive food stamps specifically they have called for restrictions so that food stamps cannot be used to buy junk food or sugary soft drinks but the food and beverage industries have spent millions opposing such measures and the u s d a has denied every request saying that selectively banning certain foods would be unfair to food stamp users and create too much red tape while the report published recently suggests that a disproportionate amount of food stamp money is going toward unhealthful foods the u s d a said it was unfair to single out food stamp recipients for their soft drink consumption the report compared snap households and households while those who used food stamps bought slightly more junk food and fewer vegetables both snap and households bought ample amounts of sweetened drinks candy ice cream and potato chips among households for example soft drinks ranked second on the list of food purchases behind milk sweetened beverages are a common purchase in all households across america kevin concannon the u s d a under secretary for food nutrition and consumer services said in an interview this report raises a question for all households are we consuming too many sweetened beverages period the report was based on data from an unnamed nationwide grocery chain which provided the u s d a with monthly records of food items bought in 2011 by more than 26 million households about three million of them food stamp recipients the grocery chain identified and tracked snap households by their use of snap benefit cards at the checkout aisle one limitation of the report was that it could not always distinguish when snap households used their benefits other money or a combination of the two to pay for transactions nonetheless the report provides a striking look at the foods american households typically buy across all households the report found more money was spent on soft drinks than any other item a finding that reflects the fact that while consumption of sugary drinks is lower today than it was a decade ago the united states still consumes more sugary drinks than almost any other developed country studies show the u s d a report found that milk cheese potato chips beef cold cereal and baked bread were among the top purchases for all households it indicated that all americans bought ample amounts of desserts salty snacks candy and other junk foods but the snap households spent slightly less money on nutritious foods including fruits and vegetables beans eggs nuts and seeds over all the report found snap households spent about 40 cents of every dollar at the grocery store on basic items like meat fruits vegetables milk eggs and bread another 40 cents of every dollar was spent on cereal prepared foods dairy products rice and beans lastly 20 cents of each dollar was spent on a broad category of junk foods that included sweetened beverages desserts salty snacks candy and sugar snap households spent 9 3 percent of their grocery budgets on sweetened beverages that was slightly higher than the 7 1 percent figure for households that do not receive food stamps the u s d a concluded that both food stamp recipients and other households generally made similar purchases but several public health experts said the findings were deeply troubling david ludwig the director of the new balance foundation obesity prevention center at boston children s hospital said the purpose of snap was to protect the health and of the nation not to ensure that poor households had ample access to sugary drinks we have more evidence for the harms of sugary beverages than for any other category of food he said and yet it tops the list of reimbursed products in snap dr ludwig said other government programs had restrictions the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children better known as wic and the national school lunch program have strict nutrition standards medicare pays for necessary medical procedures but does not reimburse for ones it considers harmful ineffective or unnecessary snap dr ludwig said should be structured similarly no one is suggesting poor people can t choose what they want to eat he said but we re saying let s not use government benefits to pay for foods that are demonstrably going to undermine public health the federal government provides snap benefits to roughly 23 million households each month many of them homes at or below the poverty line the average household receives about 256 in monthly benefits that means a household that spent 10 percent of its snap money on sweetened beverages could buy at least 20 bottles of orange crush soda at a fine fare supermarket in new york city or about 50 cans of sprite at a walmart near oakland calif since 2004 a number of cities and states have sought to restrict sugary drinks from their snap programs including maine minnesota and new york city under mayor michael r bloomberg in 2011 but doing so requires permission from the u s d a and the agency has denied every official request mr concannon at the u s d a said the agency had intermittent dialogue with municipalities across the country about prohibiting the purchase of sugary drinks through snap but he said the agency would grant a state or city permission to do so only on the condition that it first conducted a rigorous pilot study and offered food stamp recipients the ability to opt out of the soda restrictions we d want rigorous evaluation to see what is the impact of such a policy he said pepsico lobbied the federal government to prevent restrictions on food stamp purchases in 2011 2012 and 2013 according to the center for responsive politics a nonprofit that tracks money in politics kraft foods and the sugar industry lobbied against a florida bill in 2012 that would have banned using food stamps to buy soda and junk food and in 2011 the snack food association teamed up with beverage industry lobbyists and the national confectioners association which represents candy companies to defeat new york city s proposed ban on using food stamps to buy beverages mr concannon said the u s d a rather than restricting junk foods had made incentive programs that encourage nutritious foods a priority the federal farm bill that designates money for the snap program for example set aside 100 million for programs that increase the value of food stamps that are used to buy fruits and vegetables at retail stores or farmers markets our goal has been to nudge people in the right direction he said while there is evidence that people do buy more fruits and vegetables when given incentives research suggests that banning sugary drinks would have a far more powerful impact on health in 2014 a group of stanford researchers studied 19 000 snap participants and compared whether banning sugary drinks or incentivizing fruits and vegetables would affect obesity rates the researchers found that the incentive program would not but banning sugary drinks from snap they said would be expected to significantly reduce obesity prevalence and type 2 diabetes incidence particularly among ages 18 to 65 and some racial and ethnic minorities michele simon a public health lawyer who published a critical 2012 report on the food stamp program said the new report showed that the federal government was subsidizing many foods that its own dietary guidelines explicitly told americans to consume less of this is the first time we ve had confirmation that this massive taxpayer program is promoting all the wrong kinds of foods she said i think we now have the data to back up the policy argument that this program needs to be improved ',\n",
       " 'william peter blatty the author whose book the exorcist was both a milestone in horror fiction and a turning point in his own career died on thursday in bethesda md he was 89 the cause was multiple myeloma his wife julie blatty said the exorcist the story of a girl possessed by a demon was published in 1971 and sold more than 13 million copies the 1973 movie version starring linda blair and directed by william friedkin was a runaway hit breaking records at many theaters and becoming the film to date for warner bros studios it earned mr blatty who wrote the screenplay an academy award it was also the first horror movie nominated for the oscar the exorcist marked a radical shift in mr blatty s career which was already well established in another genre he was one of hollywood s leading comedy writers mr blatty collaborated with the director blake edwards on the screenplays for four films beginning in 1964 with a shot in the dark the second movie after the pink panther starring peter sellers as the bumbling inspector clouseau and in some critics view the best his other edwards films were the comedy what did you do in the war daddy 1966 the musical darling lili 1970 and gunn 1967 based on the television detective series peter gunn he also wrote the scripts for comedies starring danny kaye warren beatty and zero mostel in praising his 1963 novel john goldfarb please come home a cold war spoof that mr blatty later adapted for the screen martin levin of the new york times invoked the humorist s j perelman one of mr blatty s literary idols mr blatty he said writes like perelman run amuck the phenomenal success of the exorcist essentially signaled the end of mr blatty s comedy career making him for all practical purposes the foremost writer in a new hybrid genre theological horror it was a mantle he was never entirely comfortable wearing when he declined his publisher s entreaties for a sequel to the exorcist and instead delivered an elegiac memoir about his mother i ll tell them i remember you published in 1973 mr blatty felt the first cinch of the straitjacket my publisher took it because i wanted to do it he was quoted as saying in faces of fear 1985 a collection of interviews with horror writers by douglas e winter but the bookstores were really hostile the sad truth is that nobody wants me to write comedy he said in another interview the exorcist not only ended that career it expunged all memory of its existence mr blatty gave various accounts of what led him to try his hand at horror he sometimes said the market for his comedy had waned in the late 1960s and he was ready to move on at other times he said that his mother s sudden death in 1967 had led to a renewed commitment to his roman catholic faith and to a soul searching about life s ultimate questions including the presence of evil in the world in every account he said the idea for the exorcist was planted in 1949 when he was a student at the georgetown university in washington and read an account in the washington post of an exorcism under the headline priest frees mt rainier boy reported held in devil s grip the incident widely discussed at the time among georgetown students and faculty members came back to mr blatty 20 years later as the basis for a book about something not getting much press in the fractured murky landscape of america the battle between good and evil he began writing what he thought would be a thriller about a girl a demon and a pair of catholic priests about halfway through he later said he sensed he had something more i knew it was going to be a success he told people magazine i couldn t wait to finish it and become famous william peter blatty was born on jan 7 1928 in manhattan to peter and mary blatty immigrants from lebanon his father left home when he was 6 and his mother supported the two of them by selling quince jelly on the streets yielding a wobbly income that precipitated 28 changes of address during a childhood he once described as comfortably destitute the church figured prominently in his life his mother was a churchgoing catholic and he was educated at prominent schools that admitted him on full scholarships the brooklyn preparatory school now closed where he was the 1946 class valedictorian and georgetown from which he graduated in 1950 after serving in the air force mr blatty worked for the united states information agency in beirut he returned to the united states for a public relations job in los angeles where he hoped to begin his career as a writer he had already published his first book a memoir which way to mecca jack but was still working in public relations in 1961 when he appeared as a contestant on you bet your life the television quiz show hosted by groucho marx he and a fellow contestant won 10 000 his winnings freed him to quit his day job and become a writer he never had a regular job again mr blatty lived in bethesda in addition to his wife the former julie witbrodt whom he married in 1983 he is survived by their son paul william blatty three daughters christine charles mary joanne blatty and jennifer blatty and two sons michael and william peter jr from earlier marriages seven grandchildren and six another son peter vincent blatty died in 2006 his death was the subject of mr blatty s 2015 book finding peter his work after the exorcist included several more theologically themed works of horror including the ninth configuration in 1978 a reworking of twinkle twinkle killer kane from 1966 and legion in 1983 both books were made into movies directed as well as written by mr blatty the film version of legion was released in 1990 as the exorcist iii mr blatty became reconciled over the years to the overwhelming dominance the exorcist most recently adapted into a 2016 tv would have on his reputation as a writer he also maintained a sense of humor about it as reflected in the name of a comic novel about hollywood he published in 1996 demons five exorcists nothing he knew he told several interviewers that it would be what people remembered him for but one thing bothered him many moviegoers including the president of warner bros had interpreted the movie s climax in which the younger of the two priests played by jason miller goads the demon into leaving the girl to take up residence inside him

       " 'atlanta in the playoffs when the best teams meet games are often decided by a mistake here or there or a penalty called or not called under coach pete carroll the seattle seahawks have built a reputation of minimizing those mistakes and forcing their opponents to make them instead but on saturday it was the seahawks who came up short in a playoff game against the atlanta falcons and their potent offense the falcons advanced to the n f c championship game next sunday when they will face the winner of this sunday s game between the dallas cowboys and the green bay packers the seahawks were leading when they forced the falcons to punt early in the second quarter seattle s devin hester who has returned 19 kickoffs and punts for touchdowns during his career caught the kick spun away from a defender then sprinted down the sideline before being knocked out of bounds deep in falcons territory the seahawks appeared poised to build a lead but a holding call on seattle linebacker kevin negated the runback and reversed seattle s field position from the atlanta line to its own line and two plays later quarterback russell wilson fell backward into the end zone for a safety after the ensuing kickoff falcons quarterback matt ryan quickly hit receiver taylor gabriel for 37 yards four plays later the falcons kicked a field goal to go ahead the quick turnaround unhinged the seahawks while the falcons sprinted ahead and captured their first playoff victory in four years after taking the lead in the second quarter atlanta s potent offense had its way with seattle s defense one of the stingiest in the n f l despite missing the star free safety earl thomas who broke his leg in week 13 just before halftime ryan led a march that ended with a touchdown pass to tevin coleman to put the falcons up you knew it was going to be a fight in terms of their defense against our offense falcons coach dan quinn said we certainly have the respect of the style they play ryan may not be flashy but he showed why he is considered a leading candidate to win the n f l s most valuable player award he does not scramble like wilson or throw fastballs into tight coverage like green bay s aaron rodgers but at 6 feet 5 inches tall he has a wide view of the field to go with an accurate arm this regular season his ninth in atlanta ryan passed for 38 touchdowns and nearly 5 000 yards he had a 69 9 percent pass completion rate and the league s top passer rating accomplishments that have often gone unnoticed perhaps because the falcons rarely play in prime time ryan s numbers 26 completions on 37 passes for 338 yards and three touchdowns with zero interceptions were enough to prompt the falcons fans to chant m v p m v p in the fourth quarter it was pretty cool considering the circumstances ryan said of the cheers ryan made few mistakes while wilson threw two interceptions quinn noted that when the falcons lost to the seahawks in the regular season his team had two more turnovers than seattle on saturday the reverse was true the falcons defense one of the most porous in the league during the regular season overwhelmed seattle s offensive line and harassed wilson frequently forcing him to scramble it also bottled up running back thomas rawls who ran effectively early in the game but ended with just 34 yards 15 fewer than wilson after nearly being burned by hester in the second quarter the falcons did a good job of keeping the ball away from him until he returned a kickoff all the way to the atlanta line setting up seattle s final touchdown a number of us and especially everyone in this room has seen that movie before quinn said of hester who played in atlanta for two years and his penchant for big plays in his five years in the league wilson has built a reputation for late comebacks in 2012 his rookie season wilson led the seahawks back from a deficit in a playoff game also in atlanta only to lose on a late field goal that magic was not evident on saturday in front of a raucous crowd at the georgia dome with his team trailing by wilson scrambled free while seeking a receiver unable to find one he decided to do with his feet what he could not with his arm he raced for the marker only to be hit hard by atlanta cornerback brian poole who drove his shoulder into wilson and threw him to the ground and it was the falcons defense that ultimately provided the capstone midway through the fourth quarter wilson was again forced to run out of the pocket in desperation he lofted a pass downfield that falcons safety ricardo allen plucked out of the air and returned 45 yards ryan s third touchdown pass a toss to mohamed sanu soon put the falcons up by and the game out of reach the victory may have given falcons fans one last chance to visit the georgia dome the team s home since 1992 next season the team will move into stadium a 1 5 billion palace 90 feet to the south the falcons are now in playoff games in the georgia dome if the packers beat the cowboys in texas on sunday the falcons will host the n f c championship game here for the fans the ability to come back here one more time i think that would be something we would all look forward to quinn said ',\n",
       " 'escondido calif in southern california in the fall of 2015 a giant natural gas leak not only caused one of the worst environmental disasters in the nation s history it also knocked out a critical fuel source for regional power plants energy regulators needed a quick fix but rather than sticking with gas they turned to a technology more closely associated with flashlights batteries they freed up the utilities to start installing batteries and lots of them it is a solution that s audacious and risky the idea is that the batteries can store electricity during daylight hours when the state s many solar panels are flooding the grid with power then release it as demand peaks early evening when people get home in effect the rechargeable batteries are like an power plant and in theory able to replace an actual plant utilities have been studying batteries nationwide but none have moved ahead with the gusto of those in southern california this idea has potential but the challenge of storing electricity has vexed engineers researchers policy makers and entrepreneurs for centuries even as countless technologies have raced ahead batteries haven t yet fulfilled their promise and the most powerful new designs come with their own risks such as fire or explosion if poorly made or maintained it s the same problem that forced samsung to recall 2 5 million galaxy note 7 smartphones in september because of fire risk after racing for months engineers here in california have brought three sites close to completion to begin serving the southern california electric grid within the next month they are made up of thousands of oversize versions of the batteries now widely used in smartphones laptop computers and other digital devices one of the installations at a san diego gas electric operations center surrounded by industrial parks in escondido calif 30 miles north of san diego will be the largest of its kind in the world developers say it represents the most crucial test yet of an technology that many experts see as fundamental to a future here about 130 miles southeast of aliso canyon the site of the immense gas leak in 2015 the equivalent of operating about 1 7 million cars over the course of a year 19 000 battery modules the size of a kitchen drawer are being wired together in racks they will operate out of two dozen beige trailers made by samsung the batteries are meant to store enough energy to serve as a backup in cases of fuel shortages they are also designed to absorb energy particularly solar power during the day and feed it back to the grid after dusk they in effect can fill in for the plants that might lack the fuel to fully operate because of the disastrous leak california is giving batteries the opportunity to show what they can do said andrés gluski chief executive of aes which is installing the storage systems aes is installing a smaller array for the electric utility in el cajon a suburb east of san diego and separately tesla the company perhaps better known for its electric cars has built an array for a different utility on the grid southern california edison near chino calif the stakes are high for both energy storage companies if their projects struggle or fail it could jeopardize not only the stability of southern california s grid but also interest in the technology over all after a smaller but pioneering battery project at a wind farm on oahu in hawaii went up in flames in 2012 investment in battery storage all but dried up for a few years that installation which used 12 000 batteries to help even out fluctuations in the power flow caught fire three times in its first 18 months of operation the storage developer xtreme eventually went bankrupt the wind farm turned to a different technology to smooth its output keeping a close eye on the southern california battery efforts is susan kennedy who helped shepherd california s energy policy for more than a decade as a state utility regulator and operative for two governors gray davis a democrat and arnold schwarzenegger a republican she now runs an energy storage one not involved in the response to the aliso canyon gas leak the moment one fails ms kennedy said of the big bet on batteries they won t build any more as soon as aes s chief executive mr gluski learned last june that san diego gas electric had awarded aes the big battery contract he leapt out of his chair and interrupted a meeting in his board room at the company s headquarters in arlington va as employees watched in astonishment he barreled down two flights of stairs grabbed a mallet and with a ceremonial flourish banged a gong that one of his executives kept on hand for big news mr gluski had not had much occasion to celebrate since he had taken the aes reins five years earlier the company was struggling with debt and trying to coax profits from projects around the developing world that are buffeted by instability in politics currency and commodity prices his first steps included an austerity program in which he gave up many of his own executive perks no more membership no more corporate audi a8 with driver but the more part of his plan would be aes s battery division which was then fledgling the unit had roots in two midlevel executives who had been speculating about a future over beers those two men john zahurancik a science fiction fan and chris shelton a former physics teacher had started talking about batteries a decade ago before electric cars became fashionable or even feasible in 2006 mr shelton had come across a professor s paper that predicted a future dominated by electric cars that when parked could be connected to the power grid so their batteries could act as storage devices to help balance electricity demand he and mr zahurancik bounced the idea off some aes colleagues who said it was at least theoretically feasible so the two continued their bull sessions but decided that stationary battery arrays may make more sense than relying on electric cars at the time batteries the standard in consumer products were widely in use in the transportation and power tool industries but no one had paired them with the technology necessary to serve the power grid earlier experiments with and other types of batteries worked only for a year or two before conking out a different technology flow batteries which use chemicals dissolved in liquids in tanks were considered even more experimental but lithium packs more energy per weight than other metals offering the promise of greater energy density and longevity the trick would be to figure out how to harness all that power which creates heat while avoiding the fires such batteries have caused in any number of vehicles and gadgets including teslas hp computers hoverboards and most recently samsung galaxy note 7s the two hit upon a design and persuaded executives to begin a pilot project in 2008 that eventually led to the first commercial battery on a grid mr zahurancik who owns the gong is now president of aes energy storage mr shelton is now the company s vice president and chief technology officer aes does not actually make its batteries but buys them along with other equipment from manufacturers like samsung lg chem and panasonic it designs and assembles the arrays stacking the boxy batteries into racks inside containers in escondido where local radio stations still carry public service announcements about the shortage the aes battery packs are being installed at a critical spot on the regional electrical grid the place where the giant wires from power plants and wind and solar arrays connect to the network of local wires the batteries are intended to relieve the pressure on the system mainly they will serve as a kind of sponge soaking up excess or solar energy during the day and then squeezing it back into the grid in the evening when demand surges as the sun sets there is enough capacity in the containers full of batteries to power about 20 000 homes for four hours the idea is that they help the utility lessen its dependence on the type of natural gas plants known as peakers which can turn on and off quickly to meet sudden peaks of demand but are generally used only for short periods and at great expense and peakers by burning fossil fuel are also at odds with california s goals the project is also being watched closely by advocates for renewable energy the reason if battery installations work as designed they would help wind or solar generators to act more like conventional power plants by working steadily even when the sun isn t shining or the wind isn t blowing energy storage is really the tool to do renewables integration for a utility infrastructure company like us said josh gerber advanced technology integration manager of sdge as workers smoothed the concrete pads that support the containers at the escondido site without it you have more risk that the variability of renewables is going to cause reliability problems under the contract aes is responsible for making sure the batteries perform for 10 years after which sdge will take over one potential downside is that if the batteries are fully charged and discharged each day they could degrade more quickly the executives involved expressed confidence in the design and reliability despite samsung s recent smartphone problems not only are these batteries a different configuration than the smartphone units executives said but the larger footprint allows for the inclusion of sophisticated monitoring as well as industrial safety and cooling and ventilation equipment the project along with the smaller array aes has installed in el cajon could provide the leap mr gluski has been striving for aes has a deal for an even bigger installation in a 1 billion project in long beach with southern california edison that is not part of the aliso canyon remediation effort it is projected to go online by the end of 2020 the electric company plans to use batteries as part of a plan to replace an aging gas plant along the san gabriel river long term mr gluski plans to shift the company s portfolio still heavily based on coal and natural gas toward more renewable energy he sees the storage systems as vital components in turning solar and wind energy into a dominant power source in the parts of latin america asia and africa where aes is active whatever progress it has made aes still has its share of problems with 20 billion in debt and a stock price less than the value that it had at the start of the century it faces wary if not outright skeptical treatment by wall street utility analysts and energy experts who say the technology aes is peddling on such a large scale in california remains untested and financially risky the problem comes if there is a hiccup with the battery storage business in california said charles fishman a utilities analyst at morningstar you don t have the parent that can push money to it and keep it out of trouble despite all the battery activity in california executives around the utility industry remain cautious the reason we don t have widespread batteries on our system is because it is not for us said alice jackson vice president for strategic revenue initiatives at xcel a giant electricity and gas utility serving eight western and midwestern states xcel has been testing batteries about as long as aes but almost exclusively in small pilots it s fair to say we don t have experience with this technology to say that it is perfect or a nirvana ms jackson said it s something we ll observe as california goes through its experience california s latest experiment with batteries is but the latest bout in the state s long struggle to match its energy needs with its environmental sensibilities in the early 2000s after market deregulation and enron s notorious manipulation of gas supplies led to blackouts and financial instability among the power companies state officials decided to lessen reliance on natural gas by encouraging the development of wind and solar under mr schwarzenegger who was governor until 2011 officials pushed through a raft of overlapping regulations that created a boom in renewables especially solar but that upended the traditional patterns of supply and demand making the overall energy system technically and economically difficult to manage batteries were the logical solution but the technology wasn t fully developed and was still too expensive in order for companies to make the necessary investments they needed a signal that there would be a big enough market for their products so in 2010 the state approved one of the first mandates ultimately requiring utilities to install some form of storage equipment in their territories that set off a flurry of new investment and innovation and after the sudden closure of the san onofre nuclear plant on the coast in northwest san diego county in 2012 when a steam generator tube sprung a leak new contracts for battery installations but the aliso canyon accident which began on oct 23 2015 when the southern california gas company first detected the leak put that process on the gas and intermittent oily mist that spewed forth over almost four months traveled into the surrounding neighborhoods on the strong winds that sweep down from the santa susana mountains at the same time it forced the battery strategy into its most test yet now it s showtime and the pressure to succeed is high all around for aes it could signify an important step for a relic that is seeking to revitalize itself as a powerhouse in battery storage and other advanced technologies for advocates including residents of the porter ranch section of los angeles so that steven spielberg chose it as the setting for the 1982 movie e t but where many still complain of the rashes headaches and other debilitating symptoms that drove thousands from their homes during the leak it could be a powerful weapon in the fight to keep the gas depot closed but the pressure may be highest for the southern california utilities their reputations still blackened by waves of forced electricity cuts that followed the enron debacle no one wants to contemplate a repeat of that chapter when blackouts affected factories and even some hospitals when the power goes out people die said ms kennedy the former state official failure is not an option here on any level ',\n",

       " 'united states prosecutors said on friday that they had charged three executives at takata the japanese auto parts maker with fabricating test data to mask a fatal airbag defect a striking turn in a case that set off the largest automotive recall in united states history prosecutors also announced that takata had agreed to plead guilty to charges of wire fraud for providing the false data a rare outcome for businesses accused of wrongdoing the company based in tokyo was also fined 1 billion the guilty plea and fine had been widely expected but the charges against the executives intensified a scandal that has roiled regulators led to congressional hearings and brought the japanese manufacturer to the brink of bankruptcy the airbags which can rupture violently when they deploy have been linked to at least 11 deaths and more than 180 injuries in the united states they falsified and manipulated data because they wanted to make profits on their airbags knowing they were creating risk for the who are soccer moms like me barbara l mcquade a united states attorney for the eastern district of michigan said at a news conference in detroit the risk they allowed is really reprehensible she said we want auto suppliers to know they have to put safety ahead of profits cheaters will not be allowed to gain a competitive advantage the indictments are the latest moves by the outgoing obama administration to come down harder on crime including guilty pleas from companies and charges against individual managers and executives federal prosecutors this week also charged six volkswagen executives for their roles in an scandal and the automaker pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and other crimes the efforts are seen as a departure from the years following the 2008 financial crisis when not a single top bank executive went to prison fueling a public outcry over the perception that wall street giants were too big to jail takata s executives are accused of especially egregious conduct according to the indictment the executives were at the center of efforts to manipulate airbag safety data that continued for as long as 15 years they knew as early as 2000 that the airbags metal inflaters could explode prosecutors said but over the years they routinely discussed falsifying those test results discarding damaging information an action referred to internally at takata as the data the indictment said the new york times has reported extensively since 2014 on takata s tampering with its test results as well as its early failure along with its largest client honda to alert regulators to the deadly defect the times also quoted former takata engineers as saying that cost considerations drove some risky decisions about the airbags ammonium nitrate was a highly combustible and unstable chemical compound the indictment said takata however created and distributed its inflaters as a purportedly safe and stable variation the executives shinichi tanaka hideo nakajima and tsuneo chikaraishi were indicted by a grand jury in december the accusations were unsealed on friday all three had worked for takata in the united states and japan until around 2015 prosecutors said in one email dated june 2005 mr nakajima explained to colleagues including mr tanaka and mr chikaraishi that they had no choice but to manipulate test data and that they needed to cross the bridge together the indictment said takata will continue to cooperate fully with d o j in connection with its ongoing investigation the company said in a statement referring to the justice department the three executives could not be reached for comment and it was unclear who was acting as their legal representative neither the justice department nor takata would provide any contact information mr nakajima s name appears on various internal documents that have been unsealed as part of litigation against takata and he is often described as a liaison between takata s japanese and american operations he was formerly director of engineering at takata s research lab in farmington hills mich mr tanaka the highest ranking of the three men was formerly listed as an executive officer at takata headquarters and the company s chief director of procurement as well as executive vice president of takata s global inflater operations mr chikaraishi also held various executive positions including chief of airbag inflater operations for japan and asia his name appears on numerous patent applications related to airbag technology filed in the united states ms mcquade stressed that investigations were still underway we will continue to investigate and if we are able to identify additional individuals we will charge them as well she said in recent months takata has cooperated with the investigation ms mcquade said including identifying culpable individuals prosecutors took that cooperation into account in pursuing penalties she said prosecutors said the three indicted executives were thought to live in japan if so it is unclear whether they will face a court in the united states japan has an extradition treaty with the united states but in practice the japanese government has discretion over whether to comply with any extradition requests from the united states takata however has previously cooperated with authorities in this regard in 2013 three other takata executives agreed to plead guilty for their roles in a conspiracy to fix the prices of seatbelts sold in the united states the executives also agreed to serve time in a united states prison pointing to that precedent ms mcquade said she thought that the chances for an extradition were pretty good she added it s not an automatic but we re going to work hard at it in this case even with the current administration s newfound interest in going after corporate executives criminal charges against individuals in a case involving automotive safety defects are rare prosecutors can struggle to surmount high legal standards and gaps in the oversight of carmakers gaps that stem from nearly five decades of hard lobbying from the auto industry to beat back efforts to strengthen criminal penalties these gaps do not exist in some other industries like pharmaceuticals or food senators richard blumenthal of connecticut and edward j markey of massachusetts democrats who led congressional efforts to investigate takata called the justice department s effort to hold executives accountable overdue they also urged regulators to speed up efforts to fix affected cars the effort to protect drivers from takata s wrongdoing does not stop here they said in a joint statement we must recall every single vehicle with a takata airbag they said and the national highway traffic safety administration must accelerate the recall of these dangerous airbags to prevent yet another unnecessary and tragic death transportation secretary anthony foxx said regulators would keep the pressure on takata and the auto industry to make sure recalls were carried out quickly and efficiently as possible takata s airbag recall in the united states has affected nearly 70 million airbags in 42 million vehicles takata also faces a lawsuit filed by owners of cars fitted with takata airbags among other litigation it s about time somebody is being held accountable said corey burdick 28 a florida father of two who was injured in an airbag explosion in a honda civic in 2014 he had been driving to his job as a forklift operator when he collided with another car triggering his airbag which exploded and sent a metal shard into his right eye mr burdick was left blind in that eye he settled with takata and honda a year ago for an undisclosed sum he questioned however why only takata was taking the fall for a defect the car companies also knew about years ago i bought my car from honda he said but i m not going to be too harsh and hasty in my judgment i m just trying to live life

has surged since the two governments resumed relations in late 2014 in expectation that the policy known as wet foot dry foot because those caught at sea were sent back but those who made it to dry land were allowed to stay might end a senior official with the department of homeland security who spoke on the condition of anonymity in keeping with agency policy said the administration decided to end the program immediately to prevent a mass exodus that would risk lives at land and sea in cuba the abrupt change seemed to further divide people along generational lines many older cubans said the decision was a just one that would halt the steady drain of the nation s citizens especially educated ones like doctors to america one man selling copies of the newspaper granma on the street said the measure was necessary to stop undermining the cuban government by enticing people to throw their fates to the sea but younger cubans for whom the prospect of a life in america offers a glimmer of hope

america sat in the vedado park stunned he said he was nearly finished with the boat and his departure had been imminent those plans now dashed he began browsing the web for a prospective bride suggesting he would pay up to 3 000 to any woman willing to marry him and bring him to the united states my plan a was to leave in a boat he said with a rueful smile so i guess my plan b is to marry an american woman while mr obama s announcement was met with chagrin among some groups in cuba the government applauded the change in american policy which they have long complained about especially the program allowing cuban doctors to immigrate to the united states since the program began 10 years ago nearly 10 000 cuban medical professionals have been approved for residency in the united states many of them were cuban doctors sent on medical missions to friendly countries like venezuela a program that critics of the cuban government likened to human trafficking since the government took in billions of dollars a year in fees from the doctors host countries for those without a career path the loss of an american escape hatch left them with even fewer employment options it struck especially hard on those like mr iván with deep ties to family and loved ones in the united states he declined to be identified by his full name for fear of reprisal by the cuban government his brother made the trek four years ago through mexico and is now living the american dream a mortgage a car and a job that pays him a living wage now mr iván is left with a remorse for having not acted sooner and he wonders if he will ever be reunited with his girlfriend on friday morning he was even having trouble reaching her given the communication in cuba he checked his phone incessantly hoping for a text from her with each blow like this i feel farther and farther away from you he typed to her frustrated about the shaky connection accepting the reality of the new situation and without a plan he sent another message i want you to know that no matter what happens i will always love you ',\n",

       " 'george motz a burly brooklynite fashions himself as america s hamburger expert an enthusiastic carnivore who has chronicled his love affair with ground beef through books and films mr motz estimates he has eaten more than 14 000 hamburgers over the last 20 years but on a frigid monday in december mr motz sat down for a burger that promised to be unlike any he had eaten before he was at momofuku nishi a new restaurant from the celebrity chef david chang and he had come to eat the impossible burger the impossible burger wants to be the tech industry s answer to the big mac concocted by a team of food scientists in silicon valley it is made from wheat coconut oil and potatoes yet it aims to be more than just another veggie patty thanks to the addition of heme an molecule contained in blood which the company produces in bulk using fermented yeast it is designed to look smell sizzle and taste like a beef burger patrick brown the founder and chief executive of impossible foods said the goal was to disrupt the market for ground beef without killing cows you can have uncompromisingly delicious meat without using animals mr brown said in an interview mr brown a former biochemist at stanford who founded impossible foods about six years ago said that in blind taste tests some people could not distinguish between the impossible burger and a beef patty and in an informal tasting organized by the new york times the reactions were generally positive at momofuku nishi mr motz knew what he was getting the impossible burger arrived on a squishy white bun topped with a slice of american cheese lettuce and tomato fries on the side it looks real mr motz said picking up the burger and examining it it feels like the right weight and with that he took a big bite chewed vigorously and stared into the distance for impossible foods to succeed mr brown will need to win over meat eaters like mr motz no disrespect to vegetarians mr brown said but the only consumers we really care about are meat consumers a vegetarian for 40 years mr brown is not interested in making just another meatless treat for those who have already sworn off eating animals instead he said he wants to change the world when he took a sabbatical from stanford six years ago and pondered what big problem he could help solve he zeroed in on the idea of reducing the consumption of meat never mind the business of killing billions of animals for food the farming fishing and production of feed for livestock and poultry strains the earth s finite resources consuming fossil fuel emitting greenhouse gasses hogging farmland and polluting waterways it is seriously imperiling some of the world s ecosystems mr brown said but there is a solution he said produce all those same foods with all the specifications consumers demand but do it with a much lower environmental footprint without using animals as the technology that i realized was something that was fundamentally doable there is a lot of money riding on mr brown s zeal impossible foods has raised more than 180 million from investors including google ventures ubs and bill gates it is part of a new crop of food companies soylent hampton creek and juicero among them that is aiming to revolutionize the way we eat another company beyond meat is also making a ground beef alternative and is already selling in whole foods and other stores it too aims to entice meat eaters there is a growing market for these products sales of meat substitutes are up 18 percent in recent years to more than 1 billion in the united states this year from about 850 million in 2012 according to euromonitor international a research firm customers are becoming more willing to accept the idea of alternatives to meat said raphael moreau a food analyst at euromonitor and that s where the real success will come from by appealing to a much wider group beyond vegetarians but for impossible foods to succeed carnivores like mr motz would have to choose an impossible burger over a conventional hamburger at the point of sale mr brown said he had no illusions that would go vegetarian simply for the sake of the environment we have to have a product that consumers choose because they want to eat it he said the market will decide so what did america s burger expert think of the impossible burger back at momofuku nishi mr motz delivered his verdict no i m very sorry but this does not taste like a hamburger he said it tastes like a fabrication of beef not a real animal mr motz wasn t totally dismissive the impossible burger almost looked the part and the patty had a pleasurably salty crust but it lacked the distinctively greasy mouth feel of a real burger and the flavor was in mr motz s opinion bland not bad compared with a gardenburger he said but not like the real thing either this is a big step in the right direction for the veggie burger mr motz said and i haven t burped yet i usually burp mr brown said he was only getting started the impossible burger is being served in just a handful of restaurants for now there are plans to expand distribution this year and make it available for consumers to cook at home he and his team are continuing to improve its formula he said the cow is never going to get better at making meat mr brown said it was not optimized for beef it did not evolve to be eaten our burger was we re always getting better perhaps mr motz will revisit the impossible burger in the future for now he is sticking with ground beef i m proud of the fact that they have gone and made the veggie burger for the proletariat he said but any carnivore will take one bite of this burger and know it s fake with that mr motz left momofuku nishi his destination a nearby food truck where he ordered a real cheeseburger ',\n",
       " 'washington a legal fight to clean up tons of chicken manure fouling the waters of oklahoma s bucolic northeastern corner much of it from neighboring arkansas was in full swing six years ago when the conservative lawyer scott pruitt took office as oklahoma s attorney general his response put on the brakes rather than push for a federal judge to punish the companies by extracting perhaps tens of millions of dollars in damages oklahoma s new chief law enforcement officer quietly negotiated a deal to simply study the problem further the move came after he had taken tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from executives and lawyers for the poultry industry it was one of a series of instances in which mr pruitt put cooperation with industry before confrontation as he sought to blunt the impact of federal environmental policies in his state against oil gas agriculture and other interests his antipathy to federal regulation he sued the environmental protection agency 14 times in many ways defined his tenure as oklahoma s attorney general now mr pruitt tapped to head donald j trump s environmental protection agency will have the opportunity to engineer a radical shift in washington if confirmed by the senate he is expected to shelve the obama administration s aggressive environmental enforcement and embrace a more collaborative approach with the industries that the agency is charged with policing many of which have helped him advance his political career the impact would stretch from the nation s waterways to the planet s climate since the e p a carries out and enforces rules to combat global warming he has advocated and stood up for the profits of business be it the poultry companies or the energy industry and other polluters at the expense of people who have to drink the water or breathe the air said mark derichsweiler who led the oklahoma department of environmental quality division responsible for overseeing the cleanup mr derichsweiler retired in 2015 after 40 years with the state frustrated with mr pruitt s approach mr pruitt declined a request to comment but his supporters contend that his record demonstrates a deeply held philosophy that states understand their needs best and should be allowed to regulate their own environment on thursday a coalition of 23 powerful conservative advocacy groups endorsed mr pruitt s nomination in advance of his confirmation hearing set for wednesday some claim mr pruitt opposes clean air and water this could not be further from the truth wrote the groups which include the political action committee club for growth the american energy alliance which has advised mr trump on energy policy and americans for tax reform the group founded by the lobbyist grover norquist mr pruitt the endorsement said understands that many of the nation s challenges regarding clean air and water are best met at the state and local level mr pruitt if confirmed will take over the agency in an odd position he has spent the last seven years suing it to block regulations that he would be expected to put into effect and enforce some legal scholars say he should recuse himself from major pending environmental matters while groups like the environmental defense fund are urging congress to reject his confirmation the president s choices deserve a lot of deference from congress and even environmental groups said fred krupp president of the environmental defense fund but at some point when the nominee has spent his entire career attempting to dismantle environmental protections it becomes unacceptable that s why mr pruitt is the first e p a nominee from either party that the environmental defense fund has opposed in our history some experts say that while returning more authority to states can be desirable in some cases environmental protection is probably not one of them smog and toxic chemicals that foul the air and waterways of one state may originate from one or several others necessitating federal oversight of pollution pollution doesn t respect state boundaries said patrick a parenteau a professor of environmental law at vermont law school states have limited ability to regulate pollution from outside the state and almost every state is downstream or downwind from other pollution case in point the green country chicken battle that mr pruitt inherited in eastern oklahoma the phosphorus and nitrates in chicken manure were causing algae blooms in the ponds streams and lakes of the 1 acre illinois river watershed which reaches from arkansas into oklahoma in 2005 attorney general drew edmondson of oklahoma mr pruitt s predecessor sued tyson food cargill turkey and a dozen other major poultry producers for damages caused by the pollution and to force them to change the way they disposed of 300 000 tons a year of animal waste as mr pruitt ran for election at least 40 000 in contributions poured into his campaign from nearly 30 executives at poultry companies named in the lawsuit or attorneys at law firms representing them including mark simmons the founder of simmons foods donald j smith then the chief executive of tysons foods and gary weeks a lawyer listed on the court papers as representing george s another company targeted in the lawsuit according to data assembled by the nonprofit environmental working group and confirmed by the new york times that money represents about 4 percent of the total 1 million he raised in the 2010 campaign records show after mr pruitt took over instead of pushing the federal judge for a ruling that seven years later still hasn t been issued he negotiated an agreement with arkansas and the poultry companies to conduct a study of the appropriate level of phosphorus in the illinois river regulation through litigation is wrong in my view mr pruitt told the oklahoman newspaper in 2015 that was not a decision my office made it was a case we inherited j d strong director of oklahoma s wildlife department and the state s former secretary of environment praised mr pruitt for negotiating the settlement you can t force a judge to rule mr strong said pruitt didn t sit back and wait or badger the judge for a ruling he worked to get the states of oklahoma and arkansas around the table a spokesman from tyson food noted that the contributions to mr pruitt s campaign were made by the company s executives and employees including two former chief executives and members of the tyson family rather than by the company itself we ll point out that our employees are encouraged to participate in the election process of public officials at all levels and are at liberty to make personal contributions to any campaign as they see fit worth sparkman the spokesman for tyson said but mr pruitt quietly allowed the expiration of a 2003 agreement that mr edmondson helped negotiate with arkansas to reduce poultry waste pollution and to monitor the progress without seeking another formal extension of the deal and mr pruitt shut down the specialized unit of four attorneys and a criminal investigator that had helped initiate the lawsuit against the 14 poultry companies that environmental unit had broad jurisdiction forcing farmers to spend millions of dollars on their own cleanups and collecting tens of millions of dollars to clean up toxic sites in the state including poisonous waste left at an abandoned lead and zinc mine known as tar creek mr pruitt in response to questions provided a list of environmental enforcement actions taken during his tenure but the list includes cases that were largely initiated under mr pruitt s predecessor mr edmondson a spokesman for mr pruitt said that while the environmental unit had been closed environmental cases continued to be handled by the state solicitor general s unit under the leadership of attorney general pruitt this team has held bad actors accountable and protected stewardship of oklahoma s natural resources but mr edmondson said that prosecution of such environmental crimes fell as a result of the shuttering of the unit under his tenure as attorney general i don t think environmental crimes have disappeared mr edmondson said of mr pruitt in an interview it is just the filing of cases alleging environmental crimes that has largely disappeared residents who live in eastern oklahoma where local ponds and streams are still often clogged with algae said they too were frustrated phosphorus levels have declined considerably a total of about 70 percent between 1998 and 2015 but the largest reductions took place before mr pruitt became attorney general as wastewater treatment plants have been upgraded and more poultry farmers have shipped chicken waste for proper disposal still the levels remain far above the state standard and the decline in pollution has been slower than some hoped i want an attorney general and a head of our e p a who is not averse to protecting oklahoma s most outstanding waterways said ed brocksmith who is a of a group called save the illinois river at the same time that he was retreating from his predecessor s more aggressive approach mr pruitt sent a series of letters to federal regulators that in some cases were drafted by industry lobbyists and then put on his state government stationery open records obtained by the new york times in 2014 showed the letters pressed the federal government to back down on proposals to tighten controls over energy production such as oil and gas wells that can release methane mr pruitt separately filed a series of lawsuits against the federal government challenging regulations intended to reduce the discharge of poisonous mercury from power plants carbon dioxide blamed for climate change and other emissions that federal authorities argued were causing unsightly haze in oklahoma s air in total mr pruitt filed 14 lawsuits challenging federal environmental regulations in 13 of those cases the included companies that had contributed money to mr pruitt or to political campaign committees mr pruitt separately has served as a leader of the republican attorneys general association which since 2013 has collected 4 2 million from related companies including exxon mobil koch industries murray energy and southern company which in many cases have also supported the lawsuits he has filed given the scale of his regulatory challenges mr pruitt turned to major corporate law firms which typically defend energy companies fighting these laws for help in some cases that assistance was offered free bakerhostetler the law firm whose clients have included dozens of energy industry players assigned five of its lawyers to help oklahoma overturn president obama s clean power plan intended to combat climate change the law firm did not charge oklahoma anything for the work mr pruitt s office confirmed david b rivkin jr the lead attorney from bakerhostetler who handled the matter said that the work was considered charitable similar to when major law firms give free legal advice to inmates at the guantánamo bay military prison environmentalists scoffed the industries and companies through their corporate lawyers are renting the state s seal in order to make it look like their arguments are being made by scott pruitt on behalf of a state said david doniger director of the climate and clean air program at the natural resources defense counsel it is a disgrace even federal judges are skeptical mr pruitt joined with missouri and several other mostly rural states in one federal suit to beat back california s regulations requiring egg farms including those in oklahoma that wanted to sell in the state to seek more humane treatment of hens in rejecting the suit the federal judge admonished the plaintiffs the court concludes plaintiffs have not brought this action on behalf of their interest in the physical or economic of their residents in general judge kimberly j mueller of the united states district court wrote in her 2014 opinion but rather on behalf of a discrete group of egg farmers whose businesses will allegedly be impacted ',\n",

       " 'a few weeks after the election of donald j trump pundits with their eyes glued to twitter believed they d finally deciphered the master plan behind the s tweeting every time he detonated a bomb on twitter they suspected it was a sly bid to divert the public eye from more serious news about his impending administration so when mr trump reignited the dormant debate over flag burning one morning tweeting that those who set fire to the flag should suffer loss of citizenship or year in jail new york magazine s jonathan chait quickly produced a column decoding the message he called it a strange fight and a classic nationalist distraction that proves mr trump s dangerous and authoritarian politics is calculated and not merely crazy but soon a competing theory emerged minutes before mr trump s tweet fox friends one of the s favorite shows ran a segment referencing an american flag burned on a college campus to protest his victory he wasn t carrying out some strategy he was his tv twitter is an impulsive medium log in and you re greeted immediately with a text box asking what s happening as in right this second mr trump who is set to become the nation s 45th president on friday is a master of twitter but also in its thrall theories of some grand trump twitter plot forget that impetuous and aggressive tweeting has been a habit of mr trump s for years he famously avoids alcohol twitter is his vice and after eight years of posts from barackobama equally journalists are transfixed by mr trump s timeline too mr trump has always been hooked on recognition he is obsessed with his television ratings his office is festooned with magazine covers featuring himself even negative attention can be a win he s thrilled to be named time s person of the year even if the cover might evoke images of both hitler and satan but today magazine covers and tv hits lack the cultural dominance they once held as mr trump tweeted in 2013 time looks really flimsy like a free handout at a parking lot now he s found a medium where recognition arrives every fraction of a second and his reach is quantified in real time ratings but for every sentence you ever write scroll through the list of accounts mr trump follows and you ll find a tightly curated crew of trump relatives like ivanka properties trump waikiki celebrities roma downey wife to the apprentice producer mark burnett and reliably outlets fox friends naturally it s a remarkable picture of social media restraint for twitter s most uninhibited star and it gives a glimpse at the image mr trump intends to project devoted family man tremendous business magnate friend to gary player but mr trump s dominant posture is reactive and his real focus is on who follows him he almost exclusively retweets praise from fans he tweets about all the credit he deserves thank you so many people have given me credit for winning the debate last night then waits for more virtual credit to roll in he brags to journalists about the rate at which likes and retweets hit he gets high on his own supply part of the peculiarity of mr trump s tweets is that he tweets like a celebrity not a politician or a businessman even his handle realdonaldtrump suggests his full immersion in the most basic of our celebrity culture though he s preparing to assume the presidency he tweets like a hollywood social climber he fans celebrity feuds with graydon carter no talent and meryl streep and posts product endorsements buy l l bean the highest office in the land has afforded mr trump his most prominent celebrity perch his account has risen from a few million followers to nearly 20 million in the past year there was a time when some assumed that mr trump s public persona would evolve as he rose in the political ranks but there s just one trump and that s been key to his success as kim kardashian once said the secret to social media dominance is authenticity and consistency mr trump s projection of realness relies on him being reliably and wildly inappropriate that may seem like a liability for the leader of the free world but it s an asset in the celebrity roles that have led him to this moment reality tv boss howard stern guest heel eight years ago barack obama was the social media wonder headed to the white house and his tech savvy was heralded as a bright light for democracy the tweets he posts to potus never seem impulsive they seem made for posterity even his jokes are calculated to be minimally offensive and maximally educational when the nasa rover curiosity carried mr obama s signature to the surface of mars mr obama responded in the form of a dad joke that is out of this world if mr obama came to power in a time of great optimism for twitter mr trump lords over a waning platform what was once a hopeful place for global connection and resistance has become a site for coordinating harassment campaigns connecting with white supremacists and accelerating unverified and sometimes dangerous rumors its growth has slumped and its stock price has stagnated but the place suits mr trump s purposes fine for the guy who s all about appearances twitter provides the veneer of populist connection without the hassle of accountability sean spicer mr trump s incoming press secretary has suggested that twitter town halls and reddit forums may replace some typical presidential press interactions where he can easily make himself available to anonymous fans instead of the scrutiny of the press the social media platforms that were once heralded as democratic tools could also be used to undermine democratic norms all of this works because one group is as intoxicated by twitter as mr trump is journalists it s hard to explain to a normal person one of the 79 percent of american adults who don t use twitter why the platform mesmerizes the news media its search function means you can conjure material on any kind of news topic or just spend your time searching for your own name reporters still crave the ego rush of a published byline but that pales in comparison to the animated feedback loop that twitter offers the more time you spend and the more tweets you send the bigger your following becomes but twitter provides little actual reach compared with facebook or google it hardly drives any traffic to articles it s like a video game for professional validation mr trump expertly exploits journalists unwavering attention to their twitter feeds their competitive spirit and their ingrained journalistic conventions chiefly that what the president says is inherently newsworthy as a

       " 'washington just days before donald j trump raises his hand to take the oath of office police departments in chicago and baltimore have agreed to federal overhauls cubans no longer have an easy route to residency in the united states and new civil rights monuments in alabama and south carolina are on the books still in the works as the seconds tick by for president obama a negotiated release of american hostages in afghanistan another lengthy list of reduced prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenders and a raft of appointments to obscure but important federal boards and commissions and in the face of mr trump s repeated questioning about whether the united states was getting value for its security dollars in supporting nato american tanks began rolling into poland on thursday making good on a promise by mr obama to help eastern european countries counter russia s president vladimir v putin mr obama s last moments in the white house are being filled with one announcement after another each intended to bring efforts to a conclusion before members of his administration unplug their computers turn off the lights and leave their offices for the last time michael brune the executive director of the sierra club praised the president for acting to his successor by designating three civil rights sites ensuring that they are guaranteed recognition and protection just days before donald trump takes office so far mr obama has not issued any surprise pardons though he has every right to exercise that power through his final day in office the way president bill clinton pardoned marc rich a tax fugitive at the same time some things are already out of mr obama s reach federal law will not allow him to release more detainees from guantánamo bay after four more were released on jan 5 there is not enough time to finish the legal framework to regulate emissions from airplanes and officials say there are no more monuments or federal parks to be designated before the transfer of power but taken together the administration s push is an added aggravation to mr trump and members of his transition team who are anxiously counting the time until they take over it s the actions of someone who isn t fully satisfied with what he was able to do said frank luntz a republican pollster this is his chance to do these little things jason miller a spokesman for mr trump s transition team called mr obama s actions executive overreach which he said hasn t just been a problem for the past eight days it s been a problem for the past eight years ranging from illegal and unconstitutional amnesty to burdensome regulations that crush small businesses obama administration officials say they are not cutting bureaucratic corners because of mr trump s impending move into the west wing in most cases they note the efforts were begun well before the outcome of the election was known but they acknowledge that once the trump administration takes over many of mr obama s priorities will have been met the administration has made a concerted effort to complete important work that was started months or even years ago said patrick rodenbush a spokesman for mr obama these actions have been fully considered and are consistent with the priorities this administration has pursued for the past eight years much of that important work has come in a flurry of activity on friday the justice department released the findings of a investigation into allegations that the chicago police department had routinely used excessive force the report concluded that the chicago force has systemically violated the civil rights of residents the release of the report was accompanied by a negotiated agreement with the city of chicago to address the department s problem a similar agreement was reached on thursday in baltimore as justice department officials raced to complete their work ahead of friday s inauguration mr trump s justice department which is likely to be led by senator jeff sessions of alabama his choice for attorney general could still take steps to undermine federal efforts to change the police departments but officials say that with the agreements in place mr sessions who has spoken out against federal overhauls of police departments would have to actively work to reverse the previous actions attorney general loretta e lynch said the announcement in chicago set in motion a process that would continue regardless of who sits atop the justice department on thursday evening mr obama terminated a policy that allowed cubans to remain in the united states as legal residents without getting visas a change that had been long sought by the cuban government the elimination of the wet foot dry foot policy which dates to 1995 means that cubans who arrive in the united states illegally will no longer be allowed to stay and eventually qualify to apply for legal permanent residence it follows mr obama s efforts to normalize relations and restore diplomatic ties with cuba and earlier on thursday mr obama created three new national monuments to honor the struggle for civil rights in america he designated the historic a g gaston motel in birmingham ala as the birmingham civil rights national monument identified four sites in south carolina to be called the reconstruction era national monument and established the freedom riders national monument at the greyhound bus station where freedom riders were attacked in the spring of 1961 mr obama also expanded two national monuments in the west protecting more areas of cultural historic and environmental significance in oregon and california both moves could anger opponents of federal control of western lands still with less than a week before mr obama leaves office his administration is not quite done white house officials say there is likely to be at least one last batch of commutations as the president seeks to work through a backlog of cases involving long sentences of drug offenders most of whom are young minority men and each day brings new appointments to government panels in recent days mr obama has named new members to the president s council on fitness sports and nutrition the j william fulbright foreign scholarship board the institute of american indian and alaska native culture arts development and the united states merchant marine academy perhaps the most dramatic action could come any day the administration is racing to secure the release of american hostages in afghanistan including an american woman and her canadian husband who were abducted in 2012 by the haqqani network a powerful faction of the taliban the couple later had two children in captivity the terrorist group is also suspected of abducting an american professor and his australian colleague in kabul in august american special operations forces tried to rescue the two men several weeks later but they had been moved the haqqanis are demanding the release of members of their group who are being held by the afghan government on wednesday the taliban released a video in which the professors pleaded with their governments to negotiate their release ',\n",
       " 'london if british plans for leaving the european union have been a dance of the seven veils the british government removed one of them on sunday letting slip to news media that prime minister theresa may is likely to choose to exit europe s single market and its customs union a hard brexit mrs may is scheduled to make a speech on her plans on tuesday but the british weekend papers and sunday news programs were briefed by downing street about the main lines of the policy and some published selected quotations of what mrs may is scheduled to say officially a government spokesman on sunday called the reports speculation and emphasized only the extracts of the speech that were leaked by downing street itself with mrs may calling for british unity to make a success of brexit and build a truly global britain those extracts were not explicit on the single market or the customs union but the sunday newspapers which receive their own briefings from the government before publication took much the same line that britain is headed for a sharp break with europe after a transitional period downing street dislikes the term hard brexit but an outcome along those lines is not unexpected because it flows logically from the priorities mrs may has set out particularly about controlling the country s borders being outside the single market could damage britain s important financial services sector and is likely to hit the value of the pound again at least temporarily a week ago mrs may said in a television interview that britain would not be able to keep bits of its european union membership that too was interpreted as a break with the single market which requires freedom of movement and labor for all citizens of the bloc often people talk in terms as if somehow we are leaving the e u but we still want to kind of keep bits of membership she said then we are leaving we are coming out we are not going to be a member of the e u any longer she added we will be able to have control of our borders control of our laws she and her officials have made it clear that her two main priorities are ending the jurisdiction of the european court of justice over british law and restoring british control over its borders and immigration including from the european union those decisions mean that britain could no longer be a part of the single market for goods capital people and services of the european union because the rules for that market are adjudicated by the european court of justice the situation is similar for the customs union which applies only to goods membership in the customs union would mean that britain would have to obey european union regulations on manufacturing standards and would be banned from making separate trade deals with countries two of the most important reasons forces have cited for leaving the bloc another implication of leaving the single market and the customs union would be britain s desire to negotiate a new trade deal with the european union as a special partner of some kind but one different from those held by countries like norway and turkey it would also seem to mean trying to negotiate a transitional deal with brussels while the larger trade deal is being haggled out which could take many years under a transitional deal which would extend beyond the limit for negotiating the exit britain would presumably continue to have a relationship much like the current one including paying into the european union s budget in an article in the sunday times of london david davis the minister in charge of the new department for exiting the european union wrote that britain would consider ways to extend or smooth the exit process to provide certainty for businesses if it proves necessary we have said we will consider time for implementation of new arrangements he wrote we don t want the e u to fail we want it to prosper economically and politically and we need to persuade our allies that a strong new partnership with the u k will help the e u to do that in a combative interview published on sunday the chancellor of the exchequer philip hammond warned that if no agreement could be reached on market access britain could change its economic model from european style taxation and regulation to regain competitiveness the british people are not going to lie down and say too bad we ve been wounded he said we will change our model and we will come back and we will be competitively engaged those comments from an interview with the german newspaper welt am sonntag were interpreted as a warning that britain could use its corporate tax as a form of leverage in brexit negotiations in a television interview on sunday jeremy corbyn the leader of the opposition labour party said that mr hammond appears to be making a sort of threat to the european community calling it a recipe for some kind of trade war with europe in the future but mrs may s speech on tuesday judging from the excerpts is also meant to assuage european union colleagues by committing britain to a close friendly and constructive future relationship britain would prefer a customs relationship with the european union if one can be negotiated on british terms which would mean limits on the bloc s citizens working in britain and the ability to do separate trade deals european union leaders have been largely dismissive of such efforts but both sides are setting out hard positions before the real negotiations begin sometime after britain invokes article 50 of the lisbon treaty to officially begin the process of leaving the bloc mrs may insists that that will take place before the end of march even if it requires a vote of parliament setting off two years of complicated talks on extracting britain from a union it joined more than 40 years ago mr hammond is known to have argued strongly inside the government for britain to keep its access to the single market to protect its financial sector which accounts for 10 to 12 percent of britain s economic output bankers and brokers in the city of london are sometimes reviled by many britons but are also highly paid so their tax receipts are important to the treasury if a significant number of them moved their operations to european union cities or new york the pressure on the british government s budget to pay for health care pensions welfare benefits and military spending would increase substantially britain already runs a significantly higher yearly deficit than most european countries about 4 4 percent of gross domestic product and its cumulative debt is estimated at nearly 85 percent of g d p mainstream economists under fire for wrongly predicting an immediate recession after the brexit vote last june say those figures are likely to worsen as the pound falls and the economy slows from the delayed effects of brexit and the uncertainty around it mrs may has also emphasized an interest in working with the incoming american administration of donald j trump and her government trumpeted its success in arranging a washington meeting with the new president before the end of february but her officials were not likely to be happy to discover that michael gove who strongly favored brexit and whom she fired from the cabinet had secured the first british interview with mr trump scheduled to be printed in the times of london on monday that interview comes after mr trump had a series of meetings with brexit advocates like nigel farage the former leader of the u k independence party and arron banks who gave millions to fund ukip and an alternative leave campaign in the june referendum both men are expected to attend mr trump s inauguration ',\n",
       " 'reading england with its robotics magal engineering s factory in the colorless outskirts of this busy commercial town west of london is an important component of britain s booming car industry churning out millions of sophisticated vehicle parts every year yet as britain prepares to leave the european union magal is having to rethink its operations here the company has sister factories in france and germany imports components from them to assemble in reading and sends many finished products back across the english channel all with minimal paperwork and no tariffs britain s departure from the european union could change all that ending the trade that magal enjoys potentially disrupting the hiring of crucial engineers from abroad and requiring new hires to keep up with the added paperwork britain s exit is a big worry and ideally would be stopped says gamil magal magal engineering s chief executive but as a realist he is preparing to live with it that means suspending investment in britain and contemplating production cuts here even as the company continues to put money into france with britain the policy is wait and see mr magal said speaking in his office above this bustling factory in a building that once produced world war ii aircraft although britain s economy has so far not suffered the economic blowback that many predicted would follow the vote in a referendum last year to quit the bloc british companies that import or export goods and services are anxiously assessing the potential costs of departure complicating matters is continuing uncertainty over the terms of departure that the government wants to negotiate prime minister theresa may plans to start two years of formal talks with the european union on britain s withdrawal widely known as brexit by the end of march and on tuesday she is expected to give some more detail about her objectives we don t know what is going to happen the government doesn t know what is going to happen and i am not sure that the government even knows what it is asking for said david bailey professor of industrial strategy at aston university there are signs that companies might be taking action already ahead of the actual brexit in a survey of 233 financial services companies published in the sunday times of london last week 39 said they would reduce staffing because of the brexit vote and half of that number had already started to do so for british banks a big worry is whether they will able to continue offering services to clients across the bloc most international banks now have project teams working out which operations they need to move to ensure they can continue serving customers the date by which this must happen and how best to do it anthony browne the chief executive of the british bankers association wrote in the observer last year their hands are quivering over the relocate button he added sectors like agriculture hospitality and construction are worried about labor they all rely heavily on workers from southern or eastern europe whose right to employment here may be curbed to achieve mrs may s objective of reducing immigration mrs may has not said explicitly whether she wants britain to remain in europe s customs union which provides for trade across the bloc and includes some nonmembers like turkey nor has she detailed what kind of relationship she wants with the european union s single market which aims to eliminate nontariff barriers and to forge a single services market but she said in a recent interview that when britain quits the union it will not be keeping bits of its membership suggesting that she will be seeking something closer to a clean break or hard brexit and with the clock now ticking toward a planned departure from the union in 2019 companies are already having to contemplate that outcome even before ms may lays out her intentions on tuesday for mr magal the threat of trade tariffs is forcing him to rethink the structure of his business the company assembles thermostatic control units for car manufacturers including jaguar land rover in britain and daimler in germany tariffs could add anything up to 10 percent to the price of some of his products an increase he can neither afford to absorb nor pass on we don t make 10 percent profit that s for sure he said adding we won t be able to increase the price because the customer will say we will buy from the competition the logic is to reduce the amount of products that are made in britain for continental europe and vice versa mr magal said that european clients were asking him to consider moving production with all the new projects we are getting now from europe they are saying why can t you put it in your plant in europe why do you need to do it in the u k he said if there is a hard brexit as seems increasingly likely some production might be shifted to britain from the continent to serve the british market but more would shift the other way mr magal said adding that some parts could be made only in germany it is unclear what the impact will be on the reading factory and its 230 jobs or on another british factory that employs about 100 people mr magal is also worried about recruiting engineers who are in short supply in britain if new immigration restrictions are put in place and he thinks he may have to hire more administrative staff to deal with possible tariffs and other red tape british car manufacturing which has been booming in recent years after a period of decline is particularly vulnerable to tariffs key components flow back and forth across the english channel before a car is built and then the assembled vehicle itself is often exported that could mean paying tariffs repeatedly at different stages along the way around of the 1 6 million vehicles built in britain in 2015 were sold abroad about 57 percent of british car exports go to the european union last year gareth jones president of britain s society of motor manufacturers and traders called for continued membership of the single market and the ability to trade free from barriers and red tape he appealed to the government don t screw it up british officials say however that the country imports more vehicles from the european union 800 000 a year from germany alone than it exports to it so would be a net beneficiary in revenue terms from a tariff war yet germany has a bigger economic interest in keeping the 27 other european union nations together in a single market than it does in cutting britain a favorable deal that would undermine that market a negotiation seems inevitable and the longer brexit uncertainty prevails the less attractive britain is likely to be for many manufacturers including those from the auto industry the value chain crosses borders numerous times so anything that gets in the way tariff or nontariff barriers is likely to mean less investment mr bailey said ',\n",
       " 'san francisco innate immunotherapeutics is a tiny pharmaceutical company from australia that has no approved drugs and no backing from flashy venture capital firms and trades for just over a dollar a share on the australian stock exchange more than once the company has run out of money and nearly closed its doors but despite its unremarkable profile innate has some surprisingly influential boosters in washington the congressional liaison to donald j trump s transition team representative chris collins republican of new york is the company s largest shareholder and sits on the board representative tom price of georgia mr trump s nominee to be secretary of health and human services purchased shares of innate four times in 2015 and 2016 according to congressional financial disclosures totaling between 60 000 and 110 000 other washington power players with investments in the company include michael hook mr collins s chief of staff who is a top shareholder and bill paxon a washington lobbyist and former congressman according to company filings and congressional financial disclosures last summer mr price mr hook and mr paxon bought the stock at a discount as part of a private offering organized by innate aimed at sophisticated u s investors they have since quintupled their money at least on paper mr price s investments in health care companies including innate are almost certain to be a focus of questioning during his confirmation hearings next week some prominent democrats are already asking whether he may have crossed ethical lines by investing in companies that stood to benefit from legislation he helped shape senator chuck schumer and representative louise slaughter of new york and other democrats have called for investigations into mr price s trades on wednesday mr price who as health secretary would oversee the food and drug administration filed papers with the federal government saying he would divest himself of interests in several health care companies including innate phillip j blando a spokesman for the presidential transition said that mr price took his obligation to uphold the public trust very seriously and that the office of government ethics had completed an exhaustive review of his financial holdings representatives of mr price and mr collins say they have not broken any rules but what has puzzled washington and industry insiders alike is how a australian biotech with only one experimental multiple sclerosis drug under development attracted a coterie of washington investors including the man who is likely to become the next health secretary maybe chris is just a cheerleader for the company and tom price jumped in head over heels said craig holman the government affairs lobbyist for public citizen a consumer group which has asked for an investigation by the securities and exchange commission but it s got to be taken a look at it s just so suspicious someone s got to ask what just happened mr collins and mr price have both been active in shaping health care legislation and both voted in favor of the 21st century cures act which was backed by the pharmaceutical industry and included measures that would allow the f d a to approve drugs more quickly mr price is a member of the house ways and means committee s subcommittee on health and mr collins serves on the health panel of the energy and commerce committee a spokesman for mr collins said the congressman had followed all ethical guidelines and said innate was one of many companies he had been involved in he is very proud of the progress the company has made over the years and hopeful it will be able to develop a potentially lifesaving treatment for the millions of individuals suffering from secondary progressive multiple sclerosis said the spokesman michael mcadams in an interview this week in san francisco innate s chief executive simon wilkinson seemed amused at all of the attention now being paid to what he described as his little biotech at the wrong end of the world mr wilkinson and michael quinn innate s chairman said they had never heard of many of the company s more prominent investors and said they first learned that mr price had invested in the company from an article in the wall street journal which first reported his investment they also said they had not heard of mr hook the shareholder or mr paxon and said they had little interest in gaining the ear of powerful washington players their goal they said is to sell the company to a larger pharmaceutical company it won t be up to us to seek approval for the drug mr wilkinson said in the interview which took place at his hotel on a rundown block in san francisco where he was pitching the company to potential buyers at the jpmorgan health care conference like many biotech innate has had ups and downs mr wilkinson said but sometimes things happen he added in his case he said i met chris mr wilkinson said he was on a trip to the united states in 2005 when the two met and he made his pitch to mr collins who was then a businessman with a reputation for turning around struggling companies mr collins decided to invest in the company eventually joining its board in 2007 mr collins was elected county executive of erie county which includes buffalo and in 2012 he won election to congress he remained on innate s board and mr wilkinson and mr quinn said his new political career has had little impact if anything i suspect it s probably a negative mr quinn said because he s a bit harder to access he s just busy mr collins remained one of the company s top cheerleaders enlisting many of his associates as investors and even lending the company money a handful of times when it was at risk of going out of business today many of innate s biggest shareholders have ties to mr collins they include two of his adult children caitlin and cameron who are the company s and shareholders as well as several buffalo businessmen who have donated to his political campaigns according to company filings and campaign finance disclosures lindy ruff the head coach of the dallas stars hockey team and a former player and coach for the buffalo sabres is also an investor innate s sole drug in development mis416 is in clinical trials in australia and new zealand to evaluate whether it works in people with an advanced form of multiple sclerosis a midlevel trial is underway and results are due in the middle of this year experts in congressional ethics and trading rules said there did not appear to be evidence that mr collins or mr price used nonpublic information to steer their investment activities a practice that would violate what is known as the stock act which bans insider trading by members of congress but said donna m nagy a law professor at indiana university who has written on the financial investments by members of congress one needs facts in order to get answers to those questions and coming up with the facts for that is going to be difficult mr holman of public citizen said mr collins s recruiting efforts among washington power players created the opportunity for influence peddling for example mr paxon who represented mr collins s congressional district in the 1990s could appear before mr collins as both a lobbyist and a fellow investor in innate it s a very effective means of buying access and hopefully influencing politicians mr holman said mr collins s spokesman said mr paxon and mr collins had never discussed innate and noted that because they are both from the buffalo area he might have become aware of innate through other investors in the region mr paxon did not respond to emails and a call for comment last summer innate offered a select opportunity to united states investors one that mr collins s friends and associates appear to have benefited from under what is known as a private placement innate sold a limited number of shares at a discount in an effort to raise capital in company filings innate said one offering of the shares would be sold to sophisticated u s investors and would be used among other things to finance a clinical trial and to gain permission from the f d a to start a process that could lead to applying for approval of the drug in the united states last summer mr price mr hook and mr paxon were among 16 entities that took part in the private american placement as did several other of mr collins s associates and donors according to the company filing mr price and mr hook also participated in a second offering in the summer the filings show mr price purchased between 50 000 and 100 000 in innate shares in august which was among the largest stock buys he had made since 2012 according to congressional financial disclosures the investment was larger than his trades in more established pharmaceutical stocks like pfizer and merck with his discount from the private placements mr price would have purchased some stock at 25 australian cents per share in august and some at 34 cents the stock closed on friday at 1 31 mr mcadams mr collins s spokesman said the private placement was available to qualified american investors and said mr hook had previously invested in a private placement with the company in 2009 before mr collins was a congressman several other investors were longtime friends of mr collins mr mcadams said and their investment predates his time in congress mr quinn dismissed questions about whether anyone engaged in insider trading and said the company s stock had been rising in anticipation of the results of the clinical trial later this year the outcome of such trials is typically kept secret from investors and even company executives right now the whole value of this thing swings on a bet on the study results he said in san francisco this week mr wilkinson said he had received interest in a possible acquisition from about 20 high grade pharmaceutical companies the drug if approved would be the first to treat a progressive form of multiple sclerosis but he was also noting wryly that innate was such a bottom feeder at the jpmorgan conference that the company had not even qualified for an invitation to attend the main event ',\n",
       " 'collin bond had no intention of buying a 1 400 thermador warming drawer when he and his wife ashley popped into the habitat for humanity restore in new rochelle n y in the spring of 2015 but when he spotted one at the nonprofit store for the price of 50 he immediately scooped it up no matter that the couple were living in a rental in downtown brooklyn and had only just begun their search for a westchester county in earnest i didn t have a place to put it at the time but i took it said mr bond 36 an associate broker at douglas elliman in manhattan who had an idea of how expensive the drawer normally was from his work in the industry fifty dollars that s crazy he said recalling his thoughts at the time i wonder what else i can do ms bond 31 who works in public relations for the home and design industry approved i honestly didn t see the need for a warming drawer but liked the way he was thinking and so with his wife s blessing and a warming drawer in the trunk of his car mr bond began his quest for a kitchen on the cheap it wasn t long before he spotted a wolf microwave normally at least 1 000 for 200 on craigslist and found himself at the warehouse of the seller a contractor in new jersey who works on luxury developments in chatting with the contractor mr bond learned that many of the developers he worked with would replace all the appliances in model apartments with new ones once the apartments had sold even though the old ones may have been used just to boil tea or store bottled water for visitors to the building he was basically telling me i m paying an assistant to list these mr bond said i told him just give me a call next time about a month later mr bond s phone rang and he was back in new jersey with a rented and a hand truck picking up an 7 400 wine refrigerator for 1 000 from the same man mr bond paid some members of the contractor s construction crew 20 each to help him load it with his collection of discount kitchen appliances growing mr bond invested in a small storage unit paying around 150 a month now his search became strategic to match his newly acquired wine refrigerator a integrated model mr bond created alerts on craigslist for a corresponding with the same width depth and height normally 7 540 soon he had a craigslist ad in his inbox posted by a contractor who was renovating a house in westchester for clients who wanted a change in style it was a relatively new kitchen mr bond said but according to the contractor he added the people who had bought it were like we don t like this kitchen we just want a new kitchen mr bond showed up with cash in hand in tow i went in there for one fridge and ended up negotiating and getting two fridges and the dishwasher he said he paid 2 400 for the lot down from about 3 000 to ensure that the appliances worked he asked the sellers to have them up and running before he arrived i d make sure i d call them and say i m going to meet you at 2 p m on wednesday can you please make sure it s plugged in and at temperature when i get there not everything went flawlessly after being transported to the storage unit the wine refrigerator wouldn t hold the proper temperature in one of its zones something had become disconnected said mr bond who paid a local repairman 200 to fix it but with refrigerators normally selling for as much as 8 000 he figured if i m buying it for 1 000 and i put another 1 500 into it that s still an incredible savings but there was still the matter of finding a new home to house all the fancy appliances we really wanted something that we could make our own said mr bond who worked in carpentry in high school and as a general contractor during summers between college we were looking for something we could put some sweat equity into that summer they found their a prewar apartment in scarsdale n y the place was white carpet which was horrendous mr bond said i think it had actually been a pink carpet that had just gotten bleached over the years because when we moved the dining room table there was a pink ring under it mirrored wall panels in the living room had been painted over and the appliances hadn t been upgraded since the 1980s we just saw a lot of potential mr bond said underneath the old carpet there were beautiful oak floors and the walls that boxed off the kitchen living and dining rooms could come down not to mention that the place cost about a quarter of what it would have in brooklyn they closed on the apartment in july 2015 paying about 240 000 and immediately began renovating the kitchen a process that took about five months mr bond acted as the general contractor filing for permits and finding subcontractors to build out their vision a family friend drew up the plans based on the appliances mr bond had in storage but his obsession with craigslist did not end in search of an elusive miele espresso maker and viking range he checked his emails nightly he admitted he was getting a little carried away when he decided they should buy a range he found online although they had already agreed on a model my wife was like we don t need that big of a stove in our kitchen as it is we have three refrigerators this is not a commercial kitchen putting it more mildly she added he had the best of intentions but i had to reel him in on the range because it just didn t fit and we would have had to rework all of our cabinet sizes mr bond ended up buying a viking normally 5 000 for 1 500 even though it was set up for propane and their apartment uses natural gas to salvage the deal he picked up a conversion kit for about 50 at a local hardware store and did the installation himself after watching a video on youtube then just as he had resigned himself to drinking regular coffee a craigslist alert landed in his inbox for a miele espresso maker that normally sold for 3 500 a really really sweet couple who happened to live nearby were selling it for 500 he said to find out if it worked mr bond asked them to make him a cup of coffee but an error message kept popping up on the espresso maker s display mr bond left without the machine but called a few repair shops and learned that it could be fixed for 300 he returned offered the couple 200 and it was his in all the bonds paid about 6 000 for their kitchen appliances including repairs purchased new the same appliances would have cost roughly 35 000 dinner parties are a regular event in their new home and all three refrigerators are put to use although mr bond admitted it s all a little overkill i feel like a food hoarder and the warming drawer that started the whole thing it was one of the best purchases they made ms bond said we use it every time we have a group of people over ',\n",

connected with uber though they may also work for other services too and the competition is fierce the services offer discounts and promotions along with options such as car pools the ability to rate drivers and gps tracking they have flooded neighborhoods where taxi service has long been spotty and are now competing in areas like midtown manhattan where taxis once flourished and they appeal to a new generation of riders who live on their phones ordering everything from groceries to books and movies it won t be long before this is an uber town instead of a town said evan rawley an associate professor of management at the columbia business school apps have gained a huge market share in a short period of time they have expanded the market but also stolen share from taxicabs many owners and drivers are struggling in a city with more transportation options than ever including a new subway line on second avenue and the proliferation of citi bikes the medallions that give cabs the right to operate have plummeted in value going for less than half of the 1 3 million price recorded in 2013 and 2014 though industry experts have cautioned that their value was inflated at the same time many drivers have defected to the new services which often offer more flexible hours and bonuses resulting in so many taxis sitting idle in parking lots and garages that they have become known as taxi graveyards over all yellow cabs made an average of 336 737 daily trips and 4 98 million in fares in november down from 463 701 trips and 5 17 million in fares in the same month in 2010 according to city data i don t remember the last time i took a yellow cab said stacey moorehead 51 who works in advertising my son had a bar mitzvah every single weekend for six months i never took a cab i either took via or uber to take him there and to pick him up kwabena boateng 46 a cabdriver since 2001 says that things have gotten so bad that many of his friends now work for uber he makes less than he did even three years ago i am still contemplating what to do he said still michael woloz a spokesman for the metropolitan taxicab board of trade which represents the owners of 5 500 medallions said the industry was evolving to meet the demands of passengers and drivers introducing its own apps arro and curb and opening a new center in queens to provide training and recruit new drivers this is always going to be an iconic town mr woloz said uber is the same everywhere there is nothing new york about them kind of like mcdonald s or starbucks but yellow taxis are unique to new york city and while maybe a little retro they are as vital and soulful as ever new york city s taxi industry grew out of the hansom cabs of the 1800s according to graham hodges the author of taxi a social history of the new york city cabdriver after a businessman harry n allen was overcharged for a ride he started the first fleet of cabs in 1907 the shiny red cars were imported from france equipped with fare meters and lined up at a stand outside the plaza hotel as the years went on yellow taxis became popular because the color was easy to spot from a distance mr hodges said john hertz the founder of hertz car rental company started the yellow cab company in chicago in 1915 yellow became the official color of new york s medallion taxis in 1967 there were more than 16 000 cabs in new york before the city began regulating the number in 1937 out of concerns that an oversupply had led to reckless driving congestion and fares it became part of our consciousness mr hodges said they re really essential to the quotidian life of the city yellow cabs still have their fans sean lawrence 28 a freelance producer said he preferred hailing a cab because it was less complicated than fiddling with an app and because cabdrivers knew their way around i like to think the hail is here to stay he said but others have never even set foot in a yellow cab since moving to the city in june chip hermann 25 an associate at a financial services company has used only uber lyft via or juno maybe i ve missed that new york experience but i don t really want it he said it just makes sense to use technology to make things cheaper and easier uber which started operating in new york in 2011 is by far the largest of the services it provided an average of 226 046 rides per day in october 2016 followed by lyft with 35 908 rides according to city data via had 21 698 rides juno 20 426 and gett 7 227 before you used to see a sea of yellow now you see a sea of black said robert perez 63 a cabdriver for two decades as he pointed to a line of black cars on west 38th street while black cars have long served wall street banks and law firms they were not for casual or users because they had to be prearranged only taxis were allowed to pick up people on the street but now with smartphone apps that can dispatch cars in minutes there is little practical distinction between them but owners and drivers complain that while they serve the same customers as the apps they are more heavily regulated by the city uber for instance can use surge pricing to charge higher fares during peak times while cabs are locked into fixed rates by 2020 half of all yellow cabs must be while the new services have no such mandate some progress has been made in leveling the playing field but a lot more work needs to be done mr woloz said meera joshi commissioner of the taxi limousine commission said regulation was needed to protect the rights of passengers drivers and those they share the street with alix anfang an uber spokeswoman said the company filled a gap serving many neighborhoods where yellow taxis were scarce and other transportation options limited we have consistently grown fastest in communities outside of manhattan she said because there is a huge market of people who want a reliable affordable way to get around but before uber were left stranded via started in 2013 with five sport utility vehicles on the upper east side where subways are crowded even with the new line on second avenue and taxis are in short supply during commuting periods the service now has more than 1 500 cars crisscrossing much of manhattan as well as making stops in williamsburg brooklyn and at the airports via has also expanded to chicago and washington uber and lyft have their own version of a city car pool uberpool and lyft line daniel ramot 41 via s and chief executive said his service was inspired by the shared taxis in israel known as sherut that supplement the public transit system mr ramot said he could have used via himself when he worked for a biotechnology research company in midtown in 2012 at the end of a long day he would join the line of people at the curb all trying to hail cabs it was not a happy moment especially if you re trying to get home and do something he said i could just visualize these vans coming up the avenues picking people up and dropping them off ',\n",
       " 'jeanette lilly hunt was 18 when her rented a room in his camden n j home to two students who were studying across the delaware river at the crozer theological seminary mrs hunt who is now 85 said she did not pay much attention to either student until her benjamin hunt and ulysses wiggins the president of the camden county branch of the n a a c p helped the students file a police complaint the complaint was against ernest nichols a white tavern owner in maple shade n j and said that he had refused to serve the black students and their dates in june 1950 and had threatened them by firing a gun in the air the complaint was signed by the two students one of the signatures in a loopy slanted cursive reads m l king jr m l king jr who was then 21 listed his address as 753 walnut street mr hunt s home the home which has been empty for decades is still owned by mrs hunt who said the rev dr martin luther king jr was like a member of the family when he lived there from 1949 to 1951 in recent years mrs hunt has been helping activists who are trying to have the property placed on the national register of historic places while the house has been designated as a historic site by the city of camden the state of new jersey must review the application before it can move to the federal level mrs hunt whose husband jesthroe died in 2005 has been paying between 500 and 1 000 a year in property taxes to hang on to the dilapidated home which she said she has always dreamed would be restored in honor of dr king who was killed in 1968 cooper s ferry partnership a nonprofit that develops properties around the city added the walnut street home to its roster of restoration projects in the fall anthony j perno iii the chief executive of cooper s ferry said the organization was forming a committee to raise money to restore the home and was discussing how best to proceed the question is what role could the property play in a larger community discussion mr perno said it should be more than a museum but what exactly we don t know yet clayborne carson a professor and the director of the martin luther king jr research and education institute at stanford university said dr king s first personal encounter with segregation in a way that he saw his life endangered could have occurred during his time in camden another element of this was that he had a pad dr carson said of the camden home a place outside the campus dormitory where if you wanted to take a trip into philadelphia you had a place to stay dr carson learned about dr king s connection to the walnut street property from patrick duff a new jersey car salesman and amateur historian his research caused dr carson to rethink dr king s years at the seminary the first time he was out of the watchful eye of his father a traditional baptist pastor king led this life under the protective shadow of his father but here we see that at crozer he probably becomes more aware of the harsher aspects of american racism dr carson said that incident in maple shade i think is part of that awakening you see that crozer wasn t this northern oasis protected from the reality of racism mr duff found the complaint in the stanford archives while researching the episode at the maple shade tavern on january 15 of 2015 i m not even kidding it was dr king s actual birthday when i was searching an archive and i came across the actual police complaint mr duff said but the case was dropped when three white witnesses would not testify mr nichols s lawyer issued a statement at the time saying that his client did not intend to threaten the students when he fired the gun the tavern would have been the ideal place for a memorial dr carson said but it was demolished in 2011 making the camden property the next best choice anything that survives from the past that allows us to illuminate some significant aspect of the past is valuable to have dr carson said to me not preserving something like this is like going into a museum and burning one of the documents but the process for the camden house to receive state or federal recognition is slow and kate marcopul the administrator of the new jersey historic preservation office says her agency is still researching whether the home meets the criteria for the state and national registries paul loether the chief of the national register of historic places for the national park service which operates the martin luther king jr national historic site in atlanta says his staff does not judge any property until it has gone through a state review obviously it seems to be a potential candidate for its association with dr king but it really has to be evaluated according to the guidelines and criteria mr loether said the property s potential has attracted the attention of state senator tom kean jr a republican and united states representatives donald norcross democrat of new jersey and john lewis democrat of georgia mr lewis marched alongside dr king in washington on aug 28 1963 the day dr king gave his i have a dream speech mr lewis said martin luther king jr day was especially poignant this year because america s first black president barack obama will leave office on the same week as the national holiday more than any other time in our recent history there s so much talk so much discussion so much attention to the issue of race mr lewis said in an interview this is a fitting and appropriate time that we look back and see the distance we ve come the progress we ve made to recognize some of these pieces of history and save and preserve them

spread patriots are favored by 6 at one point during the season the patriots seemed nearly unbeatable but they have had to work far harder in recent weeks to keep things going the steelers meanwhile have hit their stride defensively with an offense led by the usual suspects of ben roethlisberger le veon bell and antonio brown it will be new england s 11th appearance in the a f c championship game in the 16 seasons of the tom brady era and the team will be trying to reach the super bowl for the seventh time in that span the steelers who have won two super bowls with roethlisberger are hoping to make an appearance in the game for the fourth time in 12 seasons here s how all four teams got here it may not have been the type of game the pittsburgh steelers prefer to play with all of the team s scoring coming from their kicker s foot but in the playoffs a win is a win and the steelers ugly victory over the kansas city chiefs was just enough to earn the team a trip to new england to face the patriots in the a f c championship game it was a game largely defined by pittsburgh s inability to punch the ball into the end zone after moving the ball well between the lines the game s biggest moment came near the end when sean davis the steelers defensive back whose hit helped set up a late touchdown for kansas city was able to help break up the chiefs conversion attempt that would have tied the game the steelers wasted a tremendous effort by running back le veon bell who broke his own franchise postseason record by gaining 170 yards on 30 carries despite bell s success pittsburgh was forced to turn to chris boswell the team s kicker for a postseason record six field goals breaking the previous record of five that been accomplished eight times in an interview after the game boswell rejected the notion that he was the team s newest killer b along with ben roethlisberger antonio brown and bell it was just about doing my job boswell said come out here and put it through the yellow pipes and don t really think too much don t think i m the guy or anything the chiefs had started the game well becoming the first team this season to score against pittsburgh on an opening drive but the offense went quiet after that managing one field goal and one late touchdown which was too little too late pittsburgh s defense largely eliminated tyreek hill the chiefs versatile offensive weapon he was limited to 18 rushing yards and 27 receiving yards serving as a decoy on many of kansas city s plays the steelers will now go on the road against new england trying to earn its fourth trip to the super bowl in the ben roethlisberger era i think it s going to be a showdown bell said in a televised interview obviously two great quarterbacks going two of the best teams in the a f c so it s time to settle it next week the green bay packers could not hold on to a huge early lead but in the game s final seconds aaron rodgers was given one more chance to score and his long completion to jared cook set up mason crosby s field goal in a victory over the dallas cowboys that earned the packers a trip to the n f c championship game next week against atlanta after a string of boring playoff blowouts this season all won by home teams green bay bucked the trend in a thrilling game in which the packers raced to a lead only to slowly let dallas back into the game the cowboys tied it up at before the teams traded long field goals with crosby s and makes beating out the from dan bailey that nearly resulted in overtime there were offensive fireworks on both sides as rodgers threw for 356 yards and 2 touchdowns while dak prescott the cowboys cinderella story at quarterback threw for 302 yards and 3 touchdowns while rodgers walked away with the win prescott showed exactly why the team confidently kept him as the team s starter even after longtime starter tony romo was declared healthy in the end however rodgers had just enough to overcome dallas furious comeback he rattled the cowboys defense all game catching them moving too slowly on substitutions taking advantage of penalties and deftly avoiding the rush to set up passing plays and on the final drive when his team needed him most he found cook downfield for a shocking gain that set up crosby s cook just barely got his feet down before going out of bounds with the play requiring a review after officials disagreed about whether or not he made the catch rodgers was all smiles in an interview after the game saying the game was fun but when asked about what he was thinking as his long pass to cook was reeled in he gave all the credit to cook it was a great catch by jared rodgers said adding it s just kind of schoolyard at times late in the game like that rodgers was forced to play the entire game without his top wide receiver jordy nelson but he was able to succeed thanks to strong games from cook davante adams and randall cobb ty montgomery the wide back chipped in with 11 carries for 47 yards and 2 touchdowns while also catching 6 passes for 34 yards that the game was left to crosby s strong right leg may have worried some packers fans but the veteran kicker had an incredible final four minutes of the game his make set a franchise playoff record and he had to make the attempt twice as dallas used a timeout to erase his first attempt while the was a fairly low kick it easily made it over the crossbar completing the green bay victory green bay has now won eight consecutive games after rodgers vowed to run the table following the team s loss to washington in week 11 while the quarterback s long streak without an interception finally ended in the second half he continued to show off the m v p form that had eluded him in the first half of the season the loss ended what had been a remarkable season for dallas a team that captured the no 1 seed in the n f c despite losing romo during the preseason and being forced to hand over the offense to prescott a draft pick who few expected to play let alone start but prescott and ezekiel elliott along with some tremendous play by the team s offensive line formed an offense that few could keep up with as the no 4 seed in the

having missed the game thomas the safety was sorely missed especially on a by running back devonta freeman who executed a fake that left thomas s replacement steven terrell grasping at air as he fell to the turf the houston texans defense was the only thing keeping the team together all season and the unit did its best in a lopsided loss to the new england patriots in which the team intercepted tom brady twice but also saw dion lewis become the first player in the super bowl era to score touchdowns on a run a pass and a kickoff return in a playoff game the houston defense got little help from brock osweiler the team s quarterback who seemed to change a few minds last week then reminded everyone of his flaws with three interceptions on saturday even with a victory for the patriots the

       " 'kansas city mo the most important play in football as far as the kansas city chiefs are concerned is not a long gain on first down or a defensive stop on it is the punt the humble and anyone who rebuts this point with dave toub does so at his own peril toub is the team s coordinator the mastermind behind an elite unit one that has fueled the chiefs rise to a f c contender and also his own candidacy for head coaching openings but before toub directed a group that has dominated field position and returned nine kickoffs or punts for touchdowns during his four seasons in kansas city he was a novice his first job in that area came during his first season as an n f l coach in 2001 when his current boss andy reid hired him as a assistant to the coordinator john harbaugh in philadelphia early conversations with harbaugh now a super coach in baltimore inculcated the magnitude of the punt toub who was the chicago bears coordinator for nine seasons after leaving philadelphia considers the punt an offensive play and no other offensive play registers the same consistent impact it averages more than 40 yards it flips field position it determines outcomes my philosophy is if you punt well cover well and play good defense you ll be in every game toub said in an interview last week the chiefs who play the pittsburgh steelers on sunday night in the playoffs applied that philosophy en route to going their best record since 2003 and winning the a f c west for the first time in six seasons toub stresses it to newcomers and stalwarts alike in meeting rooms and on the practice field until they too understand twice in toub s four seasons according to data compiled by football outsiders kansas city has had the best average field position in the n f l it s why the best players are on punt said one of them the rookie defensive back eric murray it is also why every period at practice begins with punting murray and his cohorts allowed the yards per return the punter dustin colquitt pooched the kicks inside the line the chiefs opponents have the average field position for good measure the chiefs punt return unit led by the rookie speedster tyreek hill produced two touchdowns and the most yards per return what powers kansas city s special teams rated by football outsiders as the unit in the n f l after the eagles is equal parts talent scheme and trust it begins with the confidence reid has in toub 54 his friend for more than 30 years it enables toub with almost the entire roster at his disposal to make decisions with conviction i wouldn t say that other ones in the past have looked over their shoulder like is this o k said colquitt in his 12th season punting for the chiefs but andy trusts him with the whole deal this is your thing put your spin on it he wants to see the dave toub side of this play the toub side manifests itself in subtleties such as an obsessive emphasis on blocking but also in more audacious moments such as the fake punt he designed and called to perfection in a week 13 victory in atlanta or what his former boss in chicago lovie smith said would have been one of the greatest plays of all time had a penalty not foiled a misdirection masterpiece for a touchdown that bewildered the green bay packers in 2011 sometimes you can hit it just right with the personnel in one place said smith who hired toub in 2004 but what dave s done is unique he s done it twice look at what his special teams do it was smith who instilled the attitude that the bears would win because of their special teams and with 22 touchdowns on kickoff or punt returns and only three allowed during toub s tenure they often did special teams are thriving again with kansas city because the chiefs prioritize them during the when they evaluate players and during the season when critical practice time is devoted on tuesdays after games players eagerly await a packet containing grades in multiple categories they receive points for things like drawing penalties tackling ball carriers and being the first player downfield on a kickoff they are docked points for things like missing tackles committing penalties and not hustling toub and his assistant brock olivo the first recipient of the college player of the year award in 1997 also assign grades to 350 potential draft picks they value two qualities above all instincts and speed if you have that combination you know you ve got a guy toub said the floor is going to be at least a good player if a prospect does not play special teams toub and olivo review his offensive or defensive film and project possible roles if two receivers or defensive backs are perceived as similar toub said the mark breaks the tie sometimes the next contributor is obvious from the outset as it was with murray who excelled on special teams at minnesota toub loved murray s toughness and intelligence traits that have served him well with the chiefs who depend on him both to make blocks and shed them his aptitude landed him on pro football focus s first team a lot of times we match up against people who weigh 250 260 said murray listed at 5 feet 11 and 199 pounds but even though we re smaller dave always says to punch them in the mouth we re relentless the constant churn at the bottom of the roster can destroy continuity but the chiefs unit has maintained a strong core frank zombo anthony sherman and daniel sorenson have played the last three seasons for instance supplemented by eager young players who volunteer for assignments recent drafts have netted d j alexander de anthony thomas demarcus robinson and hill who has returned three kicks two punts one kickoff for touchdowns toub called hill the fastest player he has ever coached faster even than devin hester regarded as one of the best returners ever toub has been fortunate to be able to deploy hill and hester but he specifically tells his charges not to expect hill to depend solely on his physical gifts he knows it s not like a video game that tyreek s not going to make everybody miss colquitt said when you go back and look and see how he got to the end zone it s because 10 guys are dedicated to blocking for him doing exactly what was drawn up during the week thirty years ago those organizational skills appealed to paso coach bob stull who gave toub a offensive lineman at the university his first coaching job in strength and conditioning unlike many of his peers in that era stull said toub maintained records of his players progress in major lifts first at utep and then at missouri it was there in 1998 where he shifted to coaching football after the sudden death of missouri s defensive line coach and it was also there stull said where toub a gifted carpenter built a home and started renovating others decades later toub remains a meticulous craftsman he just found another outlet ',\n",
       " 'jiuquan china on the edge of the gobi desert the jiuquan wind power base stands as a symbol of china s quest to dominate the world s renewable energy market with more than 7 000 turbines arranged in rows that stretch along the sandy horizon it is one of the world s largest wind farms capable of generating enough electricity to power a small country but these days the windmills loom like scarecrows idle and inert the wind howls outside but many turbines in jiuquan a city of vast deserts and farms in the northwest province of gansu have been shut off because of weak demand workers while away the hours calculating how much power the turbines could have generated if there were more buyers and wondering if and when they will ever make a profit there s not much we can do right now said zhou shenggang a manager at a energy company who oversees 134 turbines here about 60 percent of their capacity goes unused each year only the state can intervene china the world s largest emitter of greenhouse gases has pointed to its embrace of wind and solar power and other alternatives to coal to position itself at the forefront of the global effort to combat climate change more than 92 000 wind turbines have been built across the country capable of generating 145 gigawatts of electricity nearly double the capacity of wind farms in the united states one out of every three turbines in the world is now in china and the government is adding them at a rate of more than one per hour but some of its most ambitious wind projects are underused many are grappling with a nationwide economic slowdown that has dampened demand for electricity others are stymied by persistent favoritism toward the coal industry by local officials and a dearth of transmission lines to carry electricity from rural areas in the north and west to china s cities that has left china unable to generate enough renewable energy to make a serious dent in air pollution and carbon emissions despite the building spree even with its unmatched arsenal of turbines china still lags the united states wind power now accounts for 3 3 percent of electricity generation in china according to the nation s national energy administration compared with 4 7 percent in the united states chinese officials have described the challenges facing the wind sector as growing pains and they say the investments in renewable energy will pay off in the long term the costs of wind projects are falling rapidly with advances in technology and more efficient construction making them more competitive with plants powered by fossil fuels like coal and natural gas and the government has vowed to continue investing heavily in renewable energy it said this month that it intended to spend at least 360 billion through 2020 on developing renewable energy sources analysts said that china s success would depend on its ability to overcome both political and practical obstacles including resistance to renewable energy from local governments and a lack of turbines near major cities this is partly a political fight said paolo frankl head of the renewable energy division at the international energy agency still it s a very very robust and solid trajectory sebastian meyer research and advisory director at azure international a consulting firm in beijing said china was leapfrogging everybody with its investments in renewable energy but needed to push through painful policy decisions such as allowing more flexibility in setting energy prices for years they ve been talking about reform he said but really they need a different market approach that incentivizes more use of renewables going forward the jiuquan wind power base approved by the government in 2008 epitomized china s ambition to become a global leader in clean energy the government vowed to invest 17 4 billion by 2020 and build a vast farm capable of generating 20 gigawatts of power more than the combined wind capacity of several countries but the unfinished project has been slow to take off even as the government continues to build it out part of the problem is the location gansu is a barren mountainous province chosen for its strong winds and potential for growth but it is far from the booming cities of eastern china making transmission of electricity difficult gansu now has some of the highest rates of underutilization in the wind sector in china in 2015 39 percent of wind capacity in the province was wasted according to statistics compiled by the national energy administration mr frankl said inefficiency in gansu was astronomically high and underscored the need for china to build more transmission lines to carry electricity long distances and to position new turbines closer to major metropolises in gansu and elsewhere the central government has also run up against local resistance advocates for the wind industry contend that local officials have reduced production quotas for wind farms to give an advantage to coal companies the coal industry a major driver of economic growth in many provinces wields significant influence in china while the government has pledged to curb the spread of coal plants as part of its plan to make 20 percent of china s energy renewable by 2030 it has continued to add them in some places the cake is only so big said yan jing a greenpeace activist in beijing who studies climate change and energy issues it s hard for new energy companies to take a slice from traditional players even if more transmission lines were constructed ms yan said the government would have trouble persuading businesses along china s heavily developed eastern coast to buy electricity from faraway provinces the authorities failed to consider the demand factor namely how can we get closer to buyers she said there should be more development of clean energy in eastern parts of china so electricity can be absorbed locally in introducing a new energy plan last week officials acknowledged that the focus on building turbines far from urban centers had created imbalances he yongjian an official at the national energy administration said the government would now build a majority of new turbines in the east partly to reduce the need to transmit power long distances but building wind farms in the east might be difficult given the preponderance of coal plants a lack of strong winds and a scarcity of undeveloped land the tepid demand for electricity in an economic downturn has also exacerbated the troubles for renewable energy demand for electricity grew by only 0 5 percent in 2015

than 120 decapitations and mutilations are common in brazil s violent overcrowded prisons in which 40 percent of inmates have yet to be sentenced but the latest wave of brutality has appalled many here the riot began around 5 p m on saturday at the state penitentiary of alcaçuz 13 miles from natal in the state of rio grande do norte and continued until around 7 a m on sunday when riot police officers took control of the prison the situation of the rebellion is controlled said maj eduardo franco of the rio grande do norte police on sunday the authorities initially said they had found 27 bodies but the death toll was later revised to 26 major franco said there had been a mistake many of the bodies were mutilated the prison has a capacity of 620 but was holding around 1 100 prisoners when the riot began the authorities said all of the inmates had been sentenced major franco added wilma batista the director of the prison agents union in rio grande do norte sent a photograph of two headless mutilated corpses in a prison yard via a cellphone messaging service and said she had seen many others we are shocked she said with brazil swamped in recession president michel temer s government reeling from one graft scandal after another and a wave of seemingly uncontrollable prison violence many brazilians feel they are going back to a darker recent past when crime corruption and the economy were out of control we thought we had turned that page and now it is coming back said mauricio santoro a professor of international relations and political science at the state university of rio de janeiro the killings reflected the escalation of a deadly gang war that exploded when 56 prisoners were massacred in manaus in amazonas state on jan 1 four more were killed the next day in another jail in the city the state authorities attributed the manaus deaths to the family of the north an amazon drug gang that had attacked prisoners connected to a rival gang the são first capital command known by its portuguese abbreviation p c c the gangs were believed to be fighting for control of lucrative drug smuggling routes the p c c was for years allied with a rio de janeiro drug gang called the red command last year the alliance fell apart leading to a spate of prison killings on jan 6 after the manaus massacre 33 prisoners were found butchered at a prison in boa vista in roraima state in the far north of brazil the state authorities said the p c c was behind the killings four more prisoners were killed in a third manaus prison after being moved from the site of the first massacre the riot on saturday night began when prisoners linked to the p c c rebelled during visiting hours ms batista said they were in a separate prison rogério coutinho madruga which is next to alcaçuz and effectively part of the same complex she said that just six prison agents were on duty and that they managed to free visitors before retreating to another block the agents saved the visitors and had to retreat because prisoners set the block on fire ms batista said the escaped prisoners then attacked a block inside the alcaçuz jail that housed men from another gang the rio grande do crime syndicate ms batista said since 2015 many of the cells inside alcaçuz have had no bars and prisoners wander freely 24 hours a day ms batista said police officers and prison guards managed to stop the killing from spreading further but electricity to the prison was cut the police decided to wait until dawn before entering and they restrained desperate relatives who were trying to get inside lincoln gakiya a state prosecutor from an organized crime unit in são paulo state who has specialized in the p c c said its split with the red command was behind the crisis the rio gang has allied with five other gangs around brazil including the crime syndicate this war is for the hegemony of the drug trade mr gakiya said the prison system is not prepared for this gang war there is no place to separate the gangs the system is overcrowded so the tendency is to get worse a cellphone video circulating on social media showed a man with his face covered brandishing what looked like a machete or a sword walking among a large number of mutilated bodies in what appeared to be a prison yard the letters p c c were scrawled in what looked like blood on a wall although it was impossible to verify the video the bodies visible were wearing blue shorts similar to those worn by prisoners shown in local news reports grisly videos like this have circulated after all of the attacks sublieutenant eliabe marques a police officer and the president of a rio grande do norte state association of police and firefighter sublieutenants said the dispute between the p c c and the crime syndicate had grown worse recently in jail the prisoner has to join one or other of the gangs p c c or the crime syndicate he said it is a phenomenon that is making the situation in rio grande do norte even more serious ms batista said the prison agents union had warned of potentially explosive conditions inside the prison but had been ignored it is very sad not just for the butchery but to see organized crime face the state the power of the state leaving more scars on prison agents who suffer psychologically and physically from such a stressful profession she said ',\n",
       " 'los angeles dead embalmed buried a year ago that is what most movie studios would have said about musicals pointing to a long line of box office calamities rock of ages burlesque jersey boys across the universe nine the few successes in recent decades have been adaptations of broadway classics les misérables 2012 or marketed in misleading ways when 20th century fox was selling baz luhrmann s hit moulin rouge in 2001 the studio was so afraid that people would stay home if they knew it was a musical that the trailer rather awkwardly tried to avoid singing at all costs but hollywood excited in part by the critical and commercial success of la la land which cost lionsgate 30 million to make and has taken in 132 million worldwide as it streaks toward the academy awards is taking out its jazz hands again there are roughly 20 musicals in the works at studios according to the film database imdbpro some are adaptations of classic animated musicals like beauty and the beast directed by bill condon and set for release by disney in march others are films among them wicked based on contemporary broadway hits moreover several studios for the first time since the 1990s are devoting meaningful resources to films with original music this year fox will release the greatest showman which stars hugh jackman as the circus impresario p t barnum it has a dozen original songs disney has bob the musical about a man whose life becomes filled with song after a head injury universal pictures won a bidding war for an untitled musical comedy starring josh gad with original songs by the alan menken and stephen schwartz there are several reasons for renewed studio interest said marc platt a la la land producer whose other projects include an original film that will star will ferrell and kristen wiig and a sequel to mary poppins with a new score thankfully as much as hollywood is interested in brands i think people are still looking for originality and freshness mr platt said musicals can also be their own brand they have an event status i also think the ceiling on the audience is lifting you ve got a new generation of fans who have grown up with television shows like glee mr platt added music has a way of getting inside all of us and lifting us up put another way there is an inherent entertainment proposition in musicals a heightened emotional experience that people go to the movies to find mr platt a former senior executive at universal and the father of ben platt star of the hit stage production dear evan hansen has in many ways become hollywood s producer of movie musicals in 2014 he shepherded disney s adaptation of the stephen sondheim musical into the woods which took in 213 million worldwide as a major force behind wicked on broadway mr platt is working with stephen daldry who directed the film version of billy elliot to bring a movie version to theaters in 2019 yes still on track mr platt said of that project nothing fuels a hollywood boom or a boomlet as the case may be with musicals like a track record of success and some studio executives said that they were becoming more open to musicals because the animated variety had experienced such a renaissance frozen was a monster hit selling 1 3 billion in tickets worldwide over the past few months three animated musicals sing moana and trolls have taken in a combined 1 billion at the global box office disney will release a singalong version of moana with lyrics on the screen karaoke style on jan 27 some studios have also had recent success with including films like pitch perfect that rely on pop hits and mostly keep the singing to stage settings television may also be giving film executives confidence specials like the wiz live and grease live have reintroduced entertainment to a mass audience still not everyone in hollywood is convinced of a musical comeback kevin goetz chief executive of the film research company screen said in an email that he had no research indicating increased demand i think it s a long shot to think that animated movies with music which have been around for years now have a material effect in increasing the desire to see musicals he added if la la land is an exception to the box office rules it is becoming quite an exception on social media sites like instagram and facebook young people no prompting from lionsgate it promises have been uploading videos of themselves singing audition one of the film s showcase numbers during the past week the soundtrack has shot up the sales charts la la land starring emma stone

       " 'american novelists have long complained about the ability of real life to outstrip fiction in his landmark 1961 essay writing american fiction philip roth observed that actuality is continually outdoing our talents and the culture tosses up figures almost daily that are the envy of any novelist the figure roth cites is charles van doren of scandal fame but place mr van doren next to donald j trump and you can measure the change in the nature of credibility over the past mr van doren was disgraced when it was revealed that he had been given the answers to the questions on the game show a contest that television viewers believed was real not staged today an entire flourishing genre of television goes by the name reality yet no one who watches it thinks it is genuinely real that is unplanned and unedited artificiality is what makes reality television enjoyable even though these same shows if advertised as fiction would appear banal repetitive and undramatic reality is the ingredient that turns a bad fiction into an enthralling one this dynamic is part of the novel s origins the earliest english novels from moll flanders 1722 to clarissa 1748 were published anonymously with titles that implied they were true stories it took generations to establish the conventions of fiction sufficiently to allow readers to take pleasure in novels that were explicitly untrue the suspension of disbelief that fiction involves is a late stage in the evolution of taste and it may prove to have been a temporary one the rise of the memoir over the past few decades doesn t mean that readers are ready to abandon the techniques of fiction but like readers three centuries ago they want the freedom of fiction along with consequentiality of fact the author david shields diagnosed this desire in his 2010 manifesto reality hunger i find it very nearly impossible to read a contemporary novel that presents itself as a novel many fiction writers share this intuition though they respond to it in different ways one way is to make the novel by turning its imitation of reality into an exaggeration a mirror has our reality since felt apocalyptic then imagine manhattan being destroyed by zombies colson whitehead s zone one or a flood nathaniel rich s odds against tomorrow or civil war and foreign bankers gary shteyngart s super sad true love story because we know such things could never happen they mark the story as fiction because we know similar things have happened and will happen they become truthful fictions an alternative approach is to make fiction as close to fact as possible by reducing its scope to the one subject on which each writer is an unchallengeable authority himself or herself ben lerner s 10 04 tao lin s taipei and sheila heti s how should a person be all seek to convince us that we are reading about the writer s actual life these writers are engaged in a sophisticated project in which the line between truth and fiction becomes harder and harder to make out but this game has a label a book fiction and all is forgiven a fiction can never be accused of being a lie the problem is that more and more people seem to want to be lied to this is the flip side of reality hunger since a lie like a fake memoir is a fiction that does not admit its fictionality that is why the lie is so seductive it allows the liar and his audience to cooperate in changing the nature of reality itself in a way that can appear almost magical magical thinking is used as an insult but it is perhaps the most primal kind of thinking there is the problem for modern people is that we can no longer perform this magic naively with an undoubting faith in the reality of our inventions we lie to ourselves now with a bad conscience when the memoir is exposed as not having really happened we want our money back fiction was one solution to this quandary allowing us to suspend disbelief in the way that coleridge said was essential for literature but the postmodern solution is even more powerful it is the simple shamelessness that allows us to recognize a lie as a lie but still treat it as if it were a reality reality shows are a trivial example of this technique but when it comes to politics the same process can have deadly results the protocols of the elders of zion was published like moll flanders with no name on the title page it too claimed to be a true account of real events in this case a meeting at which jews plotted to take over the world and destroy civilization perhaps some of its readers when it first appeared around 1903 and even today sincerely believed that this was a real document but the protocols is even more powerful when endorsed by people who know it is false because such an act turns fact itself into an irrelevance people who can turn a lie into a truth have the power to shape reality they are poets of the real and the audience that gives them its willing suspension of disbelief is a in this uncanny transformation just as novel readers conspire in their enchantment the bond between demagogues and their audience is cemented by their exhilarating consciousness of shared culpability the problem with our politics is that a large share of the population has moved beyond true and false they thrill precisely to the falsehood of a statement because it shows that the speaker has the power to reshape reality in line with their own fantasies of beleaguerment to call novelists liars is naïve because it mistakes their intention they never wanted to be believed in the first place the same is true of demagogues from its beginning the novel has tested the distinction between truth fiction and lie now the collapse of those distinctions has given us the age of trump we are entering a period in which the very idea of literature may come to seem a luxury a distraction from political struggle but the opposite is true no matter how irrelevant hardheaded people may believe it to be literature continually proves itself a sensitive instrument a leading indicator of changes that will manifest themselves in society and culture today as always the imagination is our best guide to what reality has in store ',\n",

       " 'washington since the emergence of an unverified dossier with salacious claims about donald j trump americans have debated the ramifications of the arrival of kompromat as a feature of american politics but those debates for example over the ethics of publishing the dossier have often framed this practice as little more than a political form of blackmail and one particular to russia in fact kompromat is more than an individual piece of damaging information it is a broader attempt to manufacture public cynicism and confusion in ways that target not just one individual but an entire society and although this practice tends to be associated with russia the word kompromat is a portmanteau of the russian words for compromising and information it is a common feature of authoritarian and semiauthoritarian nations around the world specific leaks may take aim at powerful individuals but in the longer term kompromat serves the interests of the powerful which is why it is often a tool of autocrats by eroding the very idea of a shared reality and by spreading apathy and confusion among a public that learns to distrust leaders and institutions alike kompromat undermines a society s ability to hold the powerful to account and ensure the proper functioning of government when katy e pearce a professor of communications at the university of washington in seattle began studying access to technology in azerbaijan she expected to focus her research on how it could be a positive tool for promoting political freedom but she changed her tack after encountering widespread fear of the ways that the government could use technology as a tool of repression when i was interviewing people it kept on coming up and coming up she said kompromat is a very cheap and easy way for the regime to demonstrate its power and to harass people in a very visible way she added that was a danger and a deterrent for the young activists she spoke to but individual targets of kompromat are not its only victims professor pearce said it also harms society by diminishing public trust thomas rid a professor of security studies at king s college london wrote on twitter that disinformation campaigns have often deliberately blended accurate and forged details to sow distrust and confusion if the news media and public figures publicize lies they lose their credibility as trustworthy sources of information there s no reliable truth to rest upon professor pearce said every piece of information you get is possibly true possibly false degrading that trust can be deeply damaging while in russia in 2015 i was struck by how many of the people i met saw the world through a lens that i began to call the prudent hypothetical they reacted to all information whether from official sources or thirdhand rumors as if it might be true i came to realize that it was a impulse a way to prepare for any potential outcome in an unpredictable unreliable world but they were also careful not to rely on that information lest it turn out to be a fabrication they trusted only the facts they had verified themselves and only the people to whom they had close personal ties i had seen the same thing in guatemala several years earlier there spreading lies and salacious gossip to discredit one s enemies is referred to as a campaña negra or a black campaign rather than kompromat but the result was the same public trust had been so eroded that lies were equally capable of destroying the honest and rehabilitating the criminal when it appeared that yasmín barrios the judge presiding over the trial of gen efraín ríos montt guatemala s former dictator might convict him of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013 a campaign of coordinated leaks and rumors portrayed her as a corrupt agent of foreign governments willing to discredit her country in exchange for personal gain leaks and rumors attacked judge barrios personally but by extension they also undermined the credibility of the justice system in which she worked for example the news media reported that the judge had been seen dining with foreign women at a restaurant in guatemala city and suggested that this was evidence of foreign influence on her rulings in fact the foreigners were judge barrios s guatemalan mother her neighbor and a nun who was a friend of the family but the rumors had their desired effect they discredited not only judge barrios but also the genocide trial the guatemalans i met knew that the stories they heard through the news media might be part of disinformation campaigns but lacking better options many still saw the world through the lens of the prudent hypothetical viewing everything as possible and nothing as certain when general ríos montt was eventually convicted many saw him as a victim of foreign machinations rather than a perpetrator of genocide and crimes against humanity his conviction was later vacated on procedural grounds professor pearce said she saw parallels between the use of kompromat overseas and recent news in the united states although the trump dossier purported to be a warning about kompromat elsewhere she said it could also be seen as a form of kompromat itself she listed the parallels to what she had seen in her research its content is damaging but unverified its distribution was multilayered with a website in this case buzzfeed publishing the unverified material and other outlets amplifying its impact by reporting on the ensuing controversy the document also fostered uncertainty and division masha gessen a russian journalist wrote in a recent opinion column in the new york times that the release of the dossier had allowed mr trump to say that there was no such thing as truth only a battle of opinions proffered by different actors each of whom strives to be loudest for some americans the dossier sowed concern about mr trump s vulnerability to russian influence others saw its publication as evidence that mr trump was the victim of a disinformation campaign that may ultimately be to mr trump s benefit if allegations against him arise in the future americans were similarly divided in their views on the hacking of the democratic national committee s computer system when russian hackers leaked emails stolen from the committee some saw it as evidence that hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee was a victim of foreign machinations while others viewed the documents content as confirmation that mrs clinton was unreliable and dishonest the leaks distracted from more substantive campaign issues and fueled public distrust and rancor many people in the united states traditionally see the leak of confidential documents by like daniel ellsberg s release of the pentagon papers as a way to hold the powerful to account we tend to believe that transparency serves the public good and secrecy the interests of the powerful such a belief presumes that there is a fixed quantity of hidden information out there that the news media is or is not revealing but in a kompromat society incriminating material real and fake will be manufactured as needed to serve a political purpose to smear a president undermine a judge or sow distrust in an institution or process all someone needs to do is create a set of documents salacious enough to attract discussion persuade some corner of the web to publish them and then wait for the resulting controversy to be reported as news that does not hold the powerful to account and worse it undermines the institutions that are supposed to do so in the united states professor pearce said grabbing on and holding to the truth is becoming more challenging if kompromat becomes a more widespread tactic public trust will erode even further a lot of the things that are good about the u s are because we have this kind of scaffolding she said i don t want to live in an environment where i m having to really be skeptical of everything like people in authoritarian regimes have to be living like that is horrible she said it is exhausting ',\n",

offer hotel rooms condominiums and commercial office space letters of intent had been signed and square footage was being analyzed there was an opportunity to explore building trump towers internationally said mr sater who worked for a new development company that was a partner with donald j trump on a variety of deals during that decade and russia was one of those countries the s favorable comments about president vladimir v putin of russia and the conclusion of united states intelligence officials that moscow acted to help mr trump s campaign have focused attention on mr trump s business interests in russia asked about the issue at his news conference last week mr trump was emphatic on one point i have no dealings with russia and he repeated i have no deals that could happen in russia because we ve stayed away the project on the old pencil factory site ultimately fizzled and by the time mr trump entered the presidential race he had failed to get any real estate development off the ground in russia but it was not for lack of trying mr trump repeatedly sought business in russia as far back as 1987 when he traveled there to explore building a hotel he applied for his trademark in the country as early as 1996 and his children and associates have appeared in moscow over and over in search of joint ventures meeting with developers and government officials during a trip in 2006 mr sater and two of mr trump s children donald jr and ivanka stayed at the historic hotel national moscow opposite the kremlin connecting with potential partners over the course of several days as recently as 2013 mr trump himself was in moscow he had sold russian real estate developers the right to host his miss universe pageant that year and he used the visit as a chance to discuss development deals writing on twitter at the time trump is next as the russian market opened up in the era mr trump and his partners pursued russians who were newly flush with cash to buy

unpublished interview transcripts with the new york times seeking deals in russia became part of a broader strategy to expand the trump brand worldwide by the mr trump was transitioning to mostly licensing his name to hotel condominium and commercial towers rather than building or investing in real estate himself he discovered that his name was especially attractive in developing countries where the rising rich aspired to the type of ritzy glamour he personified while he nailed down ventures in the philippines india and elsewhere closing deals in russia proved challenging in 2008 donald trump jr praised the opportunities in russia but also called it a scary place to do business because of corruption and legal complications mr sater said that american hotel chains that had moved into russia did so with straightforward agreements to manage hotels that other partners owned mr trump by contrast was pursuing developments that included residential or commercial offerings in which he would take a cut of sales terms that russians were reluctant to embrace even so mr trump said his efforts put him in contact with powerful people there i called it my weekend in moscow mr trump said of his 2013 trip to moscow during a september 2015 interview on the hugh hewitt show he added i was with the people both oligarchs and generals and top of the government people i can t go further than that but i will tell you that i met the top people and the relationship was extraordinary when asked about mr trump s claim that he had stayed away from russia alan garten general counsel for the trump organization said it was a fair characterization given that none of the development opportunities ever materialized mr trump s interest in russia he said was no different from his attraction to other emerging markets in which he investigated possible ventures mr garten did not respond to questions about whom mr trump met with in moscow in 2013 and what was discussed ted liebman an architect based in new york got the call in 1996 mr trump and an american tobacco company that owned property in moscow wanted to build a residential development near an old russian olympic stadium as they prepared to meet with officials in moscow they needed sketches of the trump tower they envisioned the architect scrambled to meet the request handing over plans to mr trump at his manhattan office i hope we can do this mr liebman recalled mr trump telling him soon after mr trump was in russia promoting the proposal and singing the praises of the russian market i ve seen cities all over the world some i ve liked some i haven t mr trump said at a news conference in moscow in 1996 according to the moscow times but he added that he didn t think he had ever been as impressed with the potential of a city as i have been with moscow mr trump had been eyeing the potential for nearly a decade expressing interest to government officials ranging from the soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev they first met in washington in 1987 to the military figure alexander lebed the 1996 project never materialized but by then mr trump was already well known in russia moscow was in the midst of a construction

think of a large vegas when mr sater traveled to moscow with ivanka and donald trump jr to meet with developers in 2006 he said their attitude could be summarized as nice big city great let s do a deal here mr trump continued to work with mr sater even after his role in a huge stock manipulation scheme involving mafia figures and russian criminals was revealed mr sater pleaded guilty and served as a government informant in 2007 mr trump discussed a deal for a trump international hotel and tower in moscow that bayrock had lined up with russian investors it would be a nonexclusive deal so it would not have precluded me from doing other deals in moscow which was very important to me mr trump said in a deposition in an unsuccessful libel suit he brought against tim o brien a journalist he claimed the development had fallen apart after mr o brien wrote a book saying that mr trump was worth far less than he claimed but mr trump said he was close to striking another real estate deal in

       " 'washington with tensions escalating between donald j trump and prominent black leaders mr trump met privately on monday with the eldest son of the rev dr martin luther king jr on the holiday devoted to the civil rights hero the hastily arranged meeting at trump tower occurred as mr trump feuded publicly with representative john lewis democrat of georgia who fought for civil rights alongside dr king it has highlighted the challenges mr trump faces as he prepares to take office on friday deeply distrusted by minorities across the country many of whom have been offended by his false allegations that president obama was born outside the united states appalled that his candidacy drew backing from white supremacist organizations and dismayed at policy proposals they consider antithetical to their interests mr trump on monday did not address those issues appearing in the lobby to allow news cameras to capture pictures of him shaking hands with martin luther king iii but ignoring questions shouted by reporters about their conversation or his statements about mr lewis tentative plans for mr trump to visit the smithsonian museum of history and culture in washington as the nation paused to remember dr king had been shelved in favor of the session which lasted just under one hour but mr trump made sure that journalists had an opportunity to see him with mr king a visual manifestation of his stated aspiration to unite a divided nation mr king said the session which included a discussion about voting rights had been constructive and described mr trump as eager to present himself as inclusive he said that he is going to represent americans he s said that over and over again mr king the president of the drum major institute a progressive new public policy organization told reporters we will continue to evaluate that on monday mr king sought to defuse the furor surrounding mr trump s remarks about mr lewis saying in the heat of emotion a lot of things get said on both sides mr king has pressed for the creation of a free photographic government identification card to make it easier for americans who do not have driver s licenses including many black voters to cast ballots and he indicated on monday that mr trump had taken an interest in the plan it is very clear that the system is not working at its maximum mr king told reporters we believe we provided a solution but other leaders said mr trump s relationship with tense bordering on toxic after a strident campaign that instilled fear and a transition that has done little to allay their concerns would not improve unless the altered both his tone and his policy positions there s a lot of anxiety there s a lot of distrust there are people who have expressed to me that they re scared of what his policies might entail said marc morial the president of the national urban league mr trump won election with 8 percent of the vote according to exit polls a pew research center poll in november found roughly of african americans believed race relations would worsen during his presidency the rev al sharpton said nothing underscored mr trump s challenge more vividly than his outburst in a pair of twitter postings on saturday that called mr lewis who was brutally beaten in the bloody sunday march in 1965 in selma ala all talk and said that instead of falsely complaining about the election results he should focus on fixing his falling apart and crime infested georgia district mr lewis actually represents a district that includes part of the wealthy enclave of buckhead the world s busiest airport the centers for disease control and prevention and the georgia institute of technology mr trump s remarks were a reaction to an interview on friday in which mr lewis said he would not attend the inauguration and did not see mr trump as a legitimate president because of questions about whether russian hacking had affected the american election if you can disrespect john lewis on martin luther king day then what are you saying about the rest of us mr sharpton said adding that no single meeting mr trump could hold would alleviate the concerns felt in the community he seems to have a very negative view of what black america looks like and that is frightening to many black americans mr sharpton said he was concerned that mr trump was more interested in public appearances than substantive meetings with activists and lawmakers to address issues of voting rights criminal justice and policing reform health care and economic inequality he still thinks that we re playing television red carpet here rather than dealing with the presidency of the united states with something of real substance this is not a rev sharpton said sean spicer mr trump s press secretary and communications director announced the meeting in new york between mr trump and mr king in a morning posting on twitter in a series of television interviews on monday mr spicer said mr lewis had started the fight with his disappointing assertion that mr trump was not a legitimate president and he defended the s decision to respond telling cbs that the is not going to sit back and just take attacks without responding still mr trump himself had seemed to temper his attack on mr lewis subtly by saturday night he said that the congressman should help him focus on burning and crime infested throughout the united states and added i can use all the help i can get outside the history museum in washington on monday some visitors argued that the episode said more about the s thin skin than his views on race somebody said something bad and he s got to say something back said nancy alston of columbia md he said bad stuff about meryl streep too ginelle johnson 35 of san diego said that she believed mr trump s comments were motivated by how he views minorities but she also said that they appeared to show his proclivity to hit back at whoever criticizes him politics has become entertainment and i think trump is just a bully ms johnson said mr trump s brief sighting on monday afternoon at trump tower was a striking contrast to president obama who spent part of monday his final observance of martin luther king s birthday in office making a stop at a homeless shelter in washington earlier his wife michelle obama had spoken out subtly in her own twitter post saying she was thinking of dr king and great leaders like repjohnlewis who carry on his legacy may their example be our call to action she wrote ',\n",
       " 'today is martin luther king s birthday the federal holiday that honors the assassinated civil rights leader well not everywhere all 50 states celebrate the public holiday on the third monday in january but not all states cities and towns dedicate it solely to the rev dr martin luther king jr some package it as a broader celebration of both dr king and confederate leaders naming differences are remnants of fierce opposition to a holiday that was not officially recognized by all states until 1999 here is a brief history of how martin luther king jr day came to be how did martin luther king jr day become a holiday a federal holiday honoring dr king was first proposed four days after he was assassinated in 1968 but it took almost two decades of campaigning for it to be approved and designated at the national level in the meantime according to the king center a few northern states approved the holiday from 1973 to 1975 illinois massachusetts connecticut and by court order new jersey but momentum slowed and congress did not act advocates led by dr king s widow coretta scott king spent years lobbying for the holiday testifying before congress and gathering millions of signatures on petitions president jimmy carter expressed support for the federal holiday in 1979 the singer stevie wonder became a prominent supporter too financing a washington lobbying office and releasing a hit 1980 song in support happy birthday the campaign finally succeeded in 1983 when congress passed the king holiday bill and president ronald reagan signed it into law the third monday in january would be celebrated as martin luther king jr day starting in 1986 who opposed it proposals to honor dr king met strong resistance in congress and when the holiday was enacted many states were slow to acknowledge it new hampshire became the last state to officially recognize the holiday in 1999 after years of acrimonious debate when the proposal to create the holiday was debated in congress in 1979 republicans led the charge against it the strongest opposition came from lawmakers in the deep south such as senator jesse helms republican of north carolina and senator strom thurmond republican of south carolina who ran for president in 1948 on a segregationist platform opponents argued that giving federal employees a new paid vacation day would be too expensive and that it was inappropriate to bestow such an honor upon dr king because he had never held elected office according to an essay by donald r wolfensberger a congressional scholar at the woodrow wilson international center for scholars when the measure failed in 1979 representative cardiss collins democrat of illinois and leader of the congressional black caucus at the time said she believed that racism had played a role but by 1983 many republicans in congress had changed their minds the king holiday bill passed the house and the senate with bipartisan support and was signed by a republican president but not everyone came around to the idea mr helms had filibustered the bill and denounced dr king on the floor of the senate as someone who advocated marxism and other radical political views where does the holiday stand today although martin luther king jr day is commemorated by the federal government and in some form by all 50 states some like arizona and idaho combine commemorations of dr king s birthday with a holiday to honor civil rights a release by nueces county tex referred to the day as a county civil rights holiday biloxi miss drew backlash on twitter last week after the city s official twitter account posted an alert to residents about municipal closings on the holiday calling it great americans day the tweet was later deleted the controversy prompted a special city council meeting to consider making the city s holiday name match that of the federal holiday honoring dr king on monday morning the council voted to do so with one member absent according to video footage from a local abc station wlox and then there are a few states in the deep south arkansas alabama and mississippi that combine celebrations of the civil rights icon and that of robert e lee the confederate general lexington va even honors lee and another confederate general stonewall jackson with a parade and celebration during the weekend leading up to dr king s birthday critics have decried those arrangements as an unholy merger that commemorate both freedom and slavery a combination that is nonsensical at best and inflammatory at worst arkansas lawmakers have tried in recent years to separate the two holidays but the measures have been opposed from constituents who call the effort an affront to southern heritage or by lawmakers who say they have better things to do we re looking for a solution to a problem we don t have josh miller a republican state representative in arkansas told the associated press i haven t noticed any humongous robert e lee parades that are

       " 'roswell ga it was 1 in the morning and the orthopedic surgeon on call was preparing to operate on a woman whose foot had been shattered in a car wreck after hours of tending to other patients the woman s husband jeff anderson asked him are you too tired to do this he looked me straight in the eye very quiet guy and said i was born to do this mr anderson recalled the surgeon that night more than 20 years ago was representative tom price of georgia donald j trump s nominee for secretary of health and human services the cabinet official who will lead the new administration s efforts to dismantle the affordable care act since then the assuredness that defined mr price as a surgeon has carried into his political career he has always listened politely to other viewpoints but never swerved from his policy mission to protect his former profession from what he views as government intrusion many who knew mr price as a doctor here in atlanta s affluent northern suburbs praise his commitment to his patients but his legislative record shows that over eight years in the georgia senate and 12 years in congress he has advocated at least as much for physician groups and health care companies seeking to limit damages in malpractice cases for instance and voting against legislation that would have required the government to negotiate lower drug prices for medicare beneficiaries mr price has routinely argued that patients are the driving force behind his efforts still his positions have often coincided with the financial interests of groups whose donations have helped advance his political career doctors themselves are sharply divided over his nomination and some are particularly galled by mr price s enmity for the affordable care act and opposition to abortion rights some of his positions even clash with those of mr trump who wants to pressure pharmaceutical companies on drug prices for example and has pledged to largely leave medicare alone if confirmed mr price 62 will soon have far more power to influence the nation s vast health care system than he ever did as a lawmaker one of his first tasks would be to help mr trump and republicans in congress determine how to eviscerate and replace the health law a goal he has held since the law s passage in 2010 but as leader of the agency that oversees medicare medicaid the food and drug administration and the centers for disease control and prevention mr price would also hold considerable regulatory power with the ability to influence everything from how applications to market new drugs are reviewed to how doctors are compensated for treating elderly and poor patients as mr price prepares for two confirmation hearings the first of which is scheduled for wednesday his past efforts on behalf of companies which have donated generously to his campaigns are under scrutiny so too is mr price s history of trading in biomedical pharmaceutical and health insurance stocks while serving on the health subcommittee of the house ways and means committee democrats have called for investigations into whether he traded stock based on information he gleaned as a congressman last year mr price bought stock in a company that makes orthopedic implants shortly before introducing legislation that could have protected the company zimmer biomet from financial losses due to a new federal regulation the regulation sought to rein in spending on joint replacements for medicare patients mr price s legislation would have delayed its implementation after he introduced it zimmer s political action committee contributed to his campaign the string of events was first reported monday by cnn phillip j blando a spokesman for the trump transition team said mr price had no knowledge or input into the purchase of the zimmer stock which he said was made by a broker asked why mr price had not directed his broker to avoid buying stocks while he wrote and voted on health legislation mr blando said we know that other members of congress including democrats have holdings in health care stocks and vote on legislation in a letter to an ethics lawyer at the department of health and human services last week mr price said he would divest himself of holdings in 43 and other stocks to avoid conflicts of interest noting that the office of government ethics had completed an exhaustive review of mr price s financial holdings mr blando said last week that mr price takes his obligation to uphold the public trust very seriously although not among the billionaires whom mr trump has tapped for his cabinet mr price has profited from medicine both as a doctor and as an active investor in health companies including aetna squibb and zimmer biomet which makes artificial joints and other medical devices he has an estimated net worth of 13 6 million according to the center for responsive politics with assets that include real estate he has also been an effective even in his first run for office in 1996 his war chest of 173 000 much of which came from doctors and medical companies led his poorly financed democratic opponent to call him dr dollar a brisk workaholic who relishes the granular details of legislative proposals and process mr price expressed concern last year about mr trump s grasp of the issues taking questions from a student group at emory university he said he had voted for marco rubio in the republican primary and called mr trump an empty policy vessel who was dangerous for politics and the economy according to the student newspaper mr price who declined to be interviewed was engaged in a number of pitched partisan battles even before coming to washington in 2005 in the georgia legislature he voted against a new state flag that minimized the confederate battle cross and supported a constitutional amendment banning marriage in congress he has taken stances seen as antithetical to public health opposing regulating tobacco as a drug and favoring legislation that would make it easier to sell bullets that can pierce armor he has also written a fairly detailed plan for replacing the affordable care act it would repeal the law s expansion of medicaid and provide tax credits to help with the cost of coverage based on age instead of income with older people getting higher credits mr price grew up in dearborn mich the son and grandson of doctors who heavily influenced his career choice he has publicly recalled making house calls with his grandfather who practiced medicine into his 90s after medical school at the university of michigan he moved to georgia completing his residency at emory and setting up practice in roswell a relatively affluent conservative suburb of atlanta in the 1990s his practice compass orthopedics was among seven in the atlanta area that merged into a large group that became known as resurgens orthopaedics it became the largest orthopedic practice in georgia and now has 100 doctors and 1 000 employees spread over 21 locations dr steven b wertheim another founding partner of resurgens said one goal of the consolidation was to gain bargaining power with insurance companies and to provide m r i s physical therapy and even certain outpatient operations rather than referring patients to other providers or operating at hospitals more leverage with insurers often allows doctors to extract higher rates his overall gist was look if all we did was practice good medicine we d be broke by tomorrow dr wertheim said of mr price he understood the need to run a business as a physician mr price was constantly frustrated by having to seek insurance companies approval for his patients to get an expensive diagnostic test or physical therapy a common complaint among specialists similarly he resented when federal health regulators intervened in something he and his partners thought they were already doing well like using electronic medical records those are the things that drove him crazy dr wertheim said his resentment of government intervention in medicine drove mr price to become involved in the medical association of georgia early in his career and his work there led him to run for office in 1995 when the house seat in his district opened up but by 2002 as his legislative duties increased he traded his suburban practice for a job at grady memorial hospital a vast chaotic aging complex just a few blocks from the state capitol for the next two years mr price was the medical director of grady s orthopedic clinic seeing a vastly different population than the privately insured patients he was used to most of grady s patients are poor and black and many lack any form of insurance long waits for care are the norm and trauma including gunshot wounds is a big part of the caseload he called me and asked if there was a position said dr james r roberson the chairman of the orthopedics department at emory university school of medicine whose residents train at grady he needed some flexibility that was most of his impetus to want to return to grady because he was really very interested in pursuing a political career dr roberson said that mr price played a unique role at the clinic training residents and overseeing patient care but also seeking to address inefficiencies long wait times for example and representing the clinic at hospital administrative meetings although he saw patients he did not perform surgery or need to be on call at night an unusual arrangement dr roberson said in the legislature mr price spent his first six years in the powerless minority although he quickly rose to the position of minority whip his fortunes changed in 2003 after sonny perdue became the first republican governor since reconstruction and persuaded enough democrats to switch parties to put the senate into republican hands as the majority leader mr price s intimate knowledge of procedural rules and maneuvers gleaned from assiduous research helped advance his party s agenda in the state legislature he was the leader who delivered bad news the tactician to some of his colleagues more backslapping style his sense of humor when he used it was dry colleagues often wondered if he slept he s a machine said russell k paul a republican who served in the state senate with mr price during his two years in the majority mr price s top priority was curbing the rising cost of medical malpractice insurance which he said was forcing hospitals and nursing homes to close and forcing doctors to limit which procedures they performed he was very bright articulate and smart enough to be able to see the different sides said tom bordeaux a former democratic state lawmaker and trial lawyer who negotiated with mr price over a package of bills mr price introduced to limit doctors liability in malpractice cases but he was just totally unwilling he was very gracious and he was completely inflexible ultimately mr price failed to persuade even his republican colleagues to accept a provision that would have capped damages for malpractice victims at 250 000 mr paul now the mayor of sandy springs ga said mr price had become more partisan during his last few years in the legislature when the republicans saw an opportunity to tip the balance of power in their favor for the first time since reconstruction there was not a lot of bipartisan collegiality when it came to trying to control the government in georgia mr paul said and that environment was the crucible that began to turn tom into a hardened political warrior in congress mr price has made frequent speeches to health industry and physician groups and has occasionally introduced legislation on their behalf last year for example he sponsored a bill fighting new lower medicare payment rates for durable medical equipment like wheelchairs and canes a few months later he spoke at a conference for companies that supply such equipment which held a on his behalf that same day mr price has also supported proposals to overhaul medicare potentially putting him at odds with his new boss mr trump who has pledged not to touch the program speaking to a student group at the university of michigan in 2015 mr price expressed concern that mr trump would not listen to others including congress if elected when i hear trump saying things like i ll just do xyz without seemingly any regard for the legislative branch mr price told the group it gives me some thought ',\n",

       " 'in his successful runs for state senator in montana and then for congress representative ryan zinke has promoted his career in the navy seals as one of his main credentials going so far as to put the seals trident symbol on his campaign bus while he has portrayed his accomplishments in the navy in glowing terms mr zinke a republican and donald j trump s nominee for secretary of the interior has acknowledged one glitch that he improperly billed the government for travel to his home in montana when he was a midlevel seal team 6 officer in the late 1990s he had to repay 211 for one of two trips he has said maintaining that the episode did not derail what he described as a brilliant career but two retired admirals under whom mr zinke served say his account understates the damage that it did mr zinke was in fact punished for abusing his travel expenses they say through an evaluation that prevented him from rising to senior levels in the navy his former commanding officer in seal team 6 retired vice adm albert m calland iii who had never before discussed the matter publicly said in an interview that it was an easy decision to hit mr zinke hard over the travel claims which came at a time when he was supposed to help prevent such abuses i gave him a fitness report that i thought would not allow him to get to captain and that seemed in that regard to work o k admiral calland said even though mr zinke served in a succession of no 2 jobs in special operations after that he never got command the admiral said another retired vice admiral sean a pybus who was mr zinke s boss after he left seal team 6 said that admiral calland s decision to cite mr zinke for lapses in judgment in failing to set a proper example was a red flag for boards screening officers for coveted command jobs even if a fitness report essentially a performance evaluation gives top marks in other areas as mr zinke s did language there like hey this officer has questionable judgment that would keep him from being selected for a command position admiral pybus said and i think that s exactly what happened mr zinke has said he took the trips to scout training locations in montana and nearby parts of washington and took leave while he was there to do construction work on a family home in whitefish mont but officials who were at the command said he had less reason to scout sites at the time because he was finishing a tour as an assault team leader they said one of the trips also seemed suspicious because he had sought reimbursement for excess airline baggage even though he was traveling alone admiral calland recalled that there was a lot of discussion among senior officers about how to punish him it also hurt mr zinke the officials said that the trips came when seal team 6 which though now best known for killing osama bin laden had initially been filled with mavericks who flouted the rules wanted to project a more professional image to compete with the army s delta force for top missions a spokeswoman for mr trump said that mr zinke 55 was preparing for a senate confirmation hearing on tuesday and that neither he nor the transition team would comment for this article mr zinke s supporters say he has long since transcended the old problems through his political work and by becoming the first seal team member to be nominated for a cabinet position mr zinke who was born and raised in montana was elected to the state senate shortly after he retired from the navy in 2008 he was elected to the house of representatives in 2014 and won his second term in congress in november with 57 percent of the vote while the main focus of the hearing is likely to be his support for increasing energy drilling and mining on public lands and his stated view that climate change is not proven science senators could also question him about his navy career there is no doubt that mr zinke was well liked and a rising star in the seals before the travel expenses episode when he was a lieutenant commander in early 1998 his team snatched a bosnian serb war criminal goran jelisic on a city street and hustled him away in a van in a daring daytime operation even after admiral calland gave him declining performance marks in military bearing and leadership over the travel issues in mr zinke was promoted to the rank of commander which is equivalent to lieutenant colonel in the army air force and marines but while he would have been eligible two or three times before he retired to be placed in charge of a unit as a commanding officer he never was and without serving as a commanding officer he could not become a captain which is equivalent to a colonel in the other services and then an admiral as some of his seal peers have kenneth stethem a retired seal chief petty officer who supports mr zinke said the travel issue seemed minor so many years later we have a saying in the teams you never shoot a man with a bullet and that s exactly what s going on right here he said but some former seal team members claim that mr zinke has also exploited his past he placed the seals insignia with six stars presumably for seal team 6 on his campaign bus in violation of defense department guidelines against politicizing such symbols and that he exaggerated what he did in his later military jobs to obscure that he never received commands of his own he published an autobiography in november that was grandly titled american commander and his biography on his congressional website says that he was deputy and acting commander of a task force where he led a force of over 3 500 special operations personnel in iraq in 2004 in an interview michael s repass who retired from the army as a major general and was mr zinke s boss in iraq chuckled and said that might be a stretch general repass said that while mr zinke was his deputy commander for four months he had named him acting commander for only about a week and a half when the general traveled to the united states general repass said mr zinke did a good job as his deputy and was a competent guy and he had nominated mr zinke for one of two bronze stars he received admiral pybus said that mr zinke was embarrassed and humbled when he left seal team 6 and did quite well as his deputy at a command using seal units in europe i didn t see any fallback on poor judgment or indiscretions admiral pybus said adding that he had heard mr zinke also did well in another navy job as the officer and briefly acting commander of the main seal training center mr zinke attended the university of oregon on a football scholarship and graduated in 1984 with a geology degree he served first at a regular seal team and then trained other seal team members records show that two of his early bosses believed that he had the potential to become an admiral he joined seal team 6 for a stint in 1991 after working on a staff in london mr zinke returned to seal team 6 in 1996 as the leader of gold team one of three assault teams mark cochiolo one of the enlisted team members said mr zinke fixed some disciplinary issues and got us refocused on what we were there for the high mark came on jan 22 1998 when members of mr zinke s team jumped from unmarked vans and seized mr jelisic who had called himself the serb adolf after hitler as he killed detainees during the bosnian war the operation took only a minute former team members say and mr jelisic ended up with a prison sentence admiral calland called mr zinke a superstar in his fitness report for that year and predicted that he would lead and command with distinction but in referring to the travel problems that hurt his next evaluation mr zinke surprised some of his former teammates by suggesting in his book that he was not aware that standards had tightened he recalled how team 6 members had earlier traveled and trained where they liked and navy oversight was little or none when he became the gold team leader he maintained the command had changed but i had not attributing his travel violations to either bad judgment or a bad habit he also minimized the effect the issue had on his career while he wrote that it was a hard lesson to learn and likely put a cloud over me making flag officer or admiral he referred to the episode as just a shot across the bow he also wrote that the biggest penalty was being embarrassed for wrongdoing ',\n",

afar that s cowardly he said the white house criticized him sponsors fled and a few months later abc canceled his show whatever you might think of his argument the moment was a dark chapter in the annals of public discourse it could have been a too if hbo hadn t provided mr maher with safe harbor and a new show real time which has an audience of about 4 5 million viewers yet mr maher puts that episode within the normal parameters of awful he says he s more worried about our new era when no one knows what normal is going to look like it s amazing how much anxiety mr trump s imminent inauguration is stirring in the business but perhaps not surprising given his open hostility toward the press his willingness to use his platform against any who cross him and his seemingly proud dismissal of the government and political norms that precede him no one knows whether a year from now we ll see today s fears as overblown underblown or on point mr maher is taking the approach based on his own experience in the trumpian combat caldron in 2013 that was when mr maher launched a birther or campaign about mr trump to rival the one mr trump had pursued about president obama s citizenship appearing on the tonight show he joked that mr trump was the product of crossbreeding it was the only thing he said that would explain the color of his hair he said he would donate 5 million to a charity of mr trump s choice if he could prove this wasn t the case mr maher pledged 1 million in 2012 to a super pac supporting obama mr trump s lawyers replied with a copy of his birth certificate and a demand for the money which mr maher ignored then mr trump filed a lawsuit that ultimately went nowhere it was worth it in comedy material mr maher told me taking a couple of puffs from a pipe molded into a bust of his head a gift from a friend as we stood by the bar in his living room but you definitely spent money that is mr maher had the money to pay for the courage that another comedian may not have been able to afford he takes it as a harbinger no one knows what this man is capable of mr maher said i never ever ever felt worried it never crossed my mind that george bush would do something crazy even though i knew he hated me he never sued me for a joke mr maher was particularly focused on reports that several f b i agents were agitating before the election for more aggressive examination of hillary clinton which democrats feared was politically motivated to help mr trump the justice department s inspector general has announced a broad investigation into the f b i s performance it is a very troubling idea that the f b i is politicized he said when the internal police department is politicized that s a place i don t want to be on the wrong side of i mean that s fascism you could chalk it all up to shticky paranoia and it s quite a slippery slope from there to outright fascism but with so many sharing similar worries at least among those who didn t support mr trump and with mr trump s continued cage rattling i turned to mr trump s adviser kellyanne conway for a response it seemed especially fitting because she has been a longtime guest of mr maher s dating to the 1990s when he was first blazing the trail on comedy central given mr trump s preference for twitter ms conway joked using the f b i would be so last century it s so bureaucratic and paperwork laden turning more serious she said he s not going to use the tools of state repeating the wording of my question i noted that there are of course guidelines professional tenets and laws that are meant to preclude a president s ability to use federal investigative power as a political weapon and she agreed saying this is america ms conway acknowledged though that mr maher s fears were widely held especially in hollywood witness meryl streep s golden globes address talk about a hollywood story folks are unnecessarily flattering themselves to think for two seconds that donald trump is going to call out the big dogs to make their lives miserable she said she described some of the discomfort as a natural reaction by the elites to an incoming president who is merely responding to their continued attacks where s the respect open ear and open mind she said the same people who had hoped for and desired and absolutely assumed they were going to get a different election result never laid down their muskets she said it was time she said to take the poison out of the pen and keyboard mr maher has no plans to do that when his show comes back from hiatus on inauguration day jan 20 his birthday and ms conway s but he shares ms conway s view of the cultural stakes in the election we re the losers now so it behooves us to break out of that bubble more he said mr maher said speeches like ms streep s calling actors screenwriters and the news media to arms weren t going to solve anything it looks very insular he said just the liberals talking to themselves which they are very good at doing still the bane of conservatives mr maher has more recently drawn scorn from liberals for his own diatribes against islamic extremism for which he says liberals have too much tolerance that s part of what he considers a politically correct corralling of speech from the left at the same time his restaurant selection the polo lounge in the beverly hills hotel came in defiance of a hollywood boycott that ellen degeneres and elton john helped start after the sultan of brunei whose investment agency owns the hotel imposed a new penal code in his homeland based on shariah law making gay sex and adultery punishable by stoning to death to join the boycott mr maher said as we walked through the hotel lobby would be to submit to an ineffectual form of tokenism as if the sultan of brunei is up there looking at the receipts we only sold two soups is stallone still coming in he said but sultan your harem awaits i m sorry i m still going over the receipts with that we took our seats and the waiter approached surprised to see mr maher he asked you re not in hiding that got mr maher all worked up again i can be scared he said and never pull a punch ',\n",
       " 'michiko kakutani the chief book critic for the new york times interviewed president obama about literature on friday at the white house here are excerpts from the conversation which have been edited and condensed these books that you gave to your daughter malia on the kindle what were they some of your favorites i think some of them were sort of the usual suspects so the naked and the dead or one hundred years of solitude i think she hadn t read yet then there were some books i think that are not on everybody s reading list these days but i remembered as being interesting like the golden notebook by doris lessing for example or the woman warrior by maxine hong kingston part of what was interesting was me pulling back books that i thought were really powerful but that might not surface when she goes to college have you had a chance to discuss them with her i ve had the chance to discuss some and she s interested in being a filmmaker so storytelling is of great interest to her she had just read a moveable feast i hadn t included that and she was just captivated by the idea that hemingway described his goal of writing one true thing every day what made you want to become a writer i loved reading when i was a kid partly because i was traveling so much and there were times where i d be displaced i d be the outsider when i first moved to indonesia i m this big kid that kind of stood out and then when i moved back from indonesia to hawaii i had the manners and habits probably of an indonesian kid and so the idea of having these worlds that were portable that were yours that you could enter into was appealing to me and then i became a teenager and wasn t reading that much other than what was assigned in school and playing basketball and chasing girls and imbibing things that weren t very healthy i think all of us did yeah and then i think rediscovered writing and reading and thinking in my first or second year of college and used that as a way to rebuild myself a process i write about in dreams from my father that period in new york where you were intensely reading i was hermetic it really is true i had one plate one towel and i d buy clothes from thrift shops and i was very intense and sort of humorless but it reintroduced me to the power of words as a way to figure out who you are and what you think and what you believe and what s important and to sort through and interpret this swirl of events that is happening around you every minute and so even though by the time i graduated i knew i wanted to be involved in public policy or i had these vague notions of organizing the idea of continuing to write and tell stories as part of that was valuable to me and so i would come home from work and i would write in my journal or write a story or two the great thing was that it was useful in my organizing work because when i got there the guy who had hired me said that the thing that brings people together to have the courage to take action on behalf of their lives is not just that they care about the same issue it s that they have shared stories and he told me that if you learn how to listen to people s stories and can find what s sacred in other people s stories then you ll be able to forge a relationship that lasts but my interest in public service and politics then merged with the idea of storytelling what were your short stories like it s interesting when i read them a lot of them had to do with older people i think part of the reason was because i was working in communities with people who were significantly older than me we were going into churches and probably the average age of these folks was 55 60 a lot of them had scratched and clawed their way into the middle class but just barely they were seeing the communities in which they had invested their hopes and dreams and raised their kids starting to decay steel mills had closed and there had been a lot of racial turnover in these communities and so there was also this sense of loss and disappointment and so a bunch of the short stories i wrote had to do with that sense that atmosphere one story is about an old black pastor who seems to be about to lose his church his lease is running out and he s got this loyal woman deacon who is trying to buck him up another is about an elderly couple a white couple in l a and he s like in advertising wrote jingles and he s just retired and has gotten cranky and his wife is trying to convince him that his life is not over so when i think back on what s interesting to me there is not a lot of jack kerouac young kid on the make discovering stuff it s more melancholy and reflective was writing partly a way to figure out your identity yes i think so for me particularly at that time writing was the way i sorted through a lot of crosscurrents in my life race class family and i genuinely believe that it was part of the way in which i was able to integrate all these pieces of myself into something relatively whole people now remark on this notion of me being very cool or composed and what is true is that i generally have a pretty good sense of place and who i am and what s important to me and i trace a lot of that back to that process of writing has that continued to be so in the presidency not as much as i would have liked i just didn t have time but you keep some form of a journal i ve kept some but not with the sort of discipline that i would have hoped for the main writing that i ve done during the presidency has been my speeches the ones at least that were important to me how has the speechwriting and being at the center of history and dealing with crises affected you as a writer i m not sure yet i ll have to see when i start writing the next book some of the craft of writing a good speech is identical to any other good writing is that word necessary is it the right word is there a rhythm to it that feels good how does it sound aloud i actually think that one of the useful things about speechwriting is reminding yourself that the original words are spoken and that there is a sound a feel to words that even if you re reading silently transmits itself so in that sense i think there will be some consistency but this is part of why it was important to pick up the occasional novel during the presidency because most of my reading every day was briefing books and memos and proposals and so working that very analytical side of the brain all the time sometimes meant you lost track of not just the poetry of fiction but also the depth of fiction fiction was useful as a reminder of the truths under the surface of what we argue about every day and was a way of seeing and hearing the voices the multitudes of this country are there examples of specific novels or writers well the last novel i read was colson whitehead s the underground railroad and the reminder of the ways in which the pain of slavery transmits itself across generations not just in overt ways but how it changes minds and hearts it s what you said in your farewell address about atticus finch where you said people are so isolated in their little bubbles fiction can leap it bridges them i struck up a friendship with the novelist marilynne robinson who has become a good friend and we ve become sort of pen pals i started reading her in iowa where gilead and some of her best novels are set and i loved her writing in part because i saw those people every day and the interior life she was describing that connected them the people i was shaking hands with and making speeches to it connected them with my grandparents who were from kansas and ended up journeying all the way to hawaii but whose foundation had been set in a very similar setting and so i think that i found myself better able to imagine what s going on in the lives of people throughout my presidency because of not just a specific novel but the act of reading fiction it exercises those muscles and i think that has been helpful and then there s been the occasion where i just want to get out of my own head laughter sometimes you read fiction just because you want to be someplace else what are some of those books it s interesting the stuff i read just to escape ends up being a mix of things some science fiction for a while there was a novel the problem series oh liu cixin who won the hugo award which was just wildly imaginative really interesting it wasn t so much sort of character studies as it was just this sweeping it s really about the fate of the universe exactly the scope of it was immense so that was fun to read partly because my problems with congress seem fairly petty not something to worry about aliens are about to invade laughter there were books that would blend i think really good writing with thriller genres i mean i thought gone girl was a book i loved that structure yeah and it was really well executed and a similar structure that i thought was a really powerful novel fates and furies by lauren groff i like those structures where you actually see different points of view which i have to do for this job too laughter have there been certain books that have been touchstones for you in these eight years i would say shakespeare continues to be a touchstone like most teenagers in high school when we were assigned i don t know the tempest or something i thought my god this is boring and i took this wonderful shakespeare class in college where i just started to read the tragedies and dig into them and that i think is foundational for me in understanding how certain patterns repeat themselves and play themselves out between human beings is that sort of comforting it gives me a sense of perspective i think toni morrison s writings particularly song of solomon is a book i think of when i imagine people going through hardship that it s not just pain but there s joy and glory and mystery i think that there are writers who i don t necessarily agree with in terms of their politics but whose writings are sort of a baseline for how to think about certain things v s naipaul for example his a bend in the river which starts with the line the world is what it is men who are nothing who allow themselves to become nothing have no place in it and i always think about that line and i think about his novels when i m thinking about the hardness of the world sometimes particularly in foreign policy and i resist and fight against sometimes that very cynical more realistic view of the world and yet there are times where it feels as if that may be true so in that sense i m using writing like that as a foil or something to debate against i ve read that lincoln loved shakespeare his whole life but when he was dealing with the civil war reading the history plays helped give him solace and perspective lincoln s own writings do that he is a very fine writer i d put the second inaugural up against any piece of american writing as good as anything one of the great treats of being president is in the lincoln bedroom there s a copy of the gettysburg address handwritten by him one of five copies he did for charity and there have been times in the evening when i d just walk over because it s right next to my office my home office and i just read it and perspective is exactly what is wanted at a time when events move so quickly and so much information is transmitted the ability to slow down and get perspective along with the ability to get in somebody else s shoes those two things have been invaluable to me whether they ve made me a better president i can t say but what i can say is that they have allowed me to sort of maintain my balance during the course of eight years because this is a place that comes at you hard and fast and doesn t let up is there some poem or any writing or author that you would turn to say after the mass killings in newtown conn or during the financial crisis i think that during those periods lincoln s writings king s writings gandhi s writings mandela s writings i found those particularly helpful because what you wanted was a sense of solidarity during very difficult moments this job can be very isolating so sometimes you have to hop across history to find folks who have been similarly feeling isolated churchill s a good writer and i loved reading teddy roosevelt s writing he s this big outsize character have you read a lot of presidential biographies the biographies have been useful because i do think that there s a tendency understandable to think that whatever s going on right now is uniquely disastrous or amazing or difficult and it just serves you well to think about roosevelt trying to navigate world war ii or lincoln trying to figure out whether he s going to fire george b mcclellan when rebel troops are 20 30 40 miles away i watched some of the documentary eyes on the prize after the election it was useful you do see how far we ve come and in the space of my lifetime and that s why seeing my daughters now picking up books that i read 30 years ago or 40 years ago is gratifying because i want them to have perspective not for purposes of complacency but rather to give them confidence that people with a sense of determination and courage and pluck can reshape things it s empowering for them what books would you recommend at this moment in time that captures this sense of turmoil i should probably ask you or some people who have had time to catch up on reading i ll confess that since the election i ve been busier than i expected so one of the things i m really looking forward to is to dig into a whole bunch of literature but one of the things i m confident about is that out of this moment there are a whole bunch of writers a lot of them young who are probably writing the book i need to read laughter they re ahead of me right now and so in my in addition to training the next generation of leaders to work on issues like climate change or gun violence or criminal justice reform my hope is to link them up with their peers who see fiction or nonfiction as an important part of that process when so much of our politics is trying to manage this clash of cultures brought about by globalization and technology and migration the role of stories to unify as opposed to divide to engage rather than to marginalize is more important than ever there s something particular about quieting yourself and having a sustained stretch of time that is different from music or television or even the greatest movies and part of what we re all having to deal with right now is just a lot of information overload and a lack of time to process things so we make quick judgments and assign stereotypes to things block certain things out because our brain is just trying to get through the day we re bombarded with information technology is moving so rapidly look i don t worry about the survival of the novel we re a storytelling species i think that what one of the jobs of political leaders going forward is is to tell a better story about what binds us together as a people and america is unique in having to stitch together all these disparate elements we re not one race we re not one tribe folks didn t all arrive here at the same time what holds us together is an idea and it s a story about who we are and what s important to us and i want to make sure that we continue that i know you like junot díaz s and jhumpa lahiri s books and they speak to immigration or the american dream i think lahiri s books i think díaz s books do speak to a very particular contemporary immigration experience but also this combination of that i think is universal longing for this better place but also feeling displaced and looking backwards at the same time i think in that sense their novels are directly connected to a lot of american literature some of the great books by jewish authors like philip roth or saul bellow they are steeped with this sense of being an outsider longing to get in not sure what you re giving up what you re willing to give up and what you re not willing to give up so that particular aspect of american fiction i think is still of great relevance today ',\n",

       " 'davos switzerland donald trump has never been invited here neither has nigel farage the british politician who led the brexit campaign the world economic forum an annual gathering of global policy and business leaders who come to debate the world s great challenges gets underway here monday night as the shifting political trends toward nationalism and against a sense of globalism are raising renewed questions about the relevance of the elites known as the davos class it is this group of plutocrats that largely failed to anticipate and may have even unconsciously generated the seeping movement across the globe every january a glittering array of the cognoscenti descend on the alps the bill gates the of microsoft the billionaire investor george soros jack ma the founder of china s giant alibaba and until recently angela merkel the chancellor of germany an assortment of hollywood actors including angelina jolie leonardo dicaprio and matt damon have made the pilgrimage over the years to promote their nonprofit work and the conversations tend to be dominated by issues like inequality climate change and the economic challenges facing developed and emerging countries this year the guest list includes names like president xi jinping of china vice president joseph biden jpmorgan chase s chief executive jamie dimon the head of the international monetary fund christine lagarde and former vice president al gore and yet missing from these conversations have been meaningful challengers or critics of the underlying theme that was seemingly stipulated from the birth of this event 46 years ago globalization has the potential to benefit everyone trump s election victory is a clear indication that the majority of people are not interested in a world government but want to return to a classical local democracy john mauldin an economic researcher and author recently wrote strange as it may seem to the davos men most people tend to love their patria the land of their fathers dissenting voices like those of mr trump and mr farage have rarely been part of the discussion though perhaps that will change theresa may britain s new prime minister will attend this year as will some of mr trump s advisers but the victories of mr trump and the brexit campaign can be viewed as a rebuke of davos man a name that samuel huntington the harvard political scientist gave attendees in 2004 describing them as transnationalists who have little need for national loyalty view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite s global operations the middle class in the united states and britain and perhaps in france if marine le pen the presidential candidate who has also never been invited to davos wins this spring clearly haven t felt the benefits of the world encouraged by multinational corporations that allows both immigration and commerce to take place without friction they have witnessed the rise of the davos class a network of banking and tech billionaires elected leaders who are awfully cozy with those interests and hollywood celebrities who make the whole thing seem unbearably glamorous naomi klein a columnist for the guardian wrote in a searing analysis of the american election in november she described the failure of elite neoliberalism to address the economic challenges of the masses success she wrote continuing to describe the middle class is a party to which they were not invited and they know in their hearts that this rising wealth and power is somehow directly connected to their growing debts and powerlessness the davos man has either failed to properly articulate the benefits of open trade or the reality of open trade is more complicated than previously imagined in a nod to this new reality the world economic forum has put together an index of what it calls inclusive growth and development which measures 109 countries according to their progress on economic growth and reducing income inequality and breaks out subsets of those countries to compare with different data sets according to the index median income actually declined by 2 4 percent between 2008 and 2013 across the 26 advanced economies where data is available which may help explain the shifting political winds it s our response to how capitalism has failed us and how we need to fix it said adrian monck a member of the forum s executive committee the united states ranked 23rd out of 30 advanced economies in terms of wage and nonwage compensation it ranked last in social protection it came in 25th it also came in 25th on intermediation of business investment in other words the amount of money that goes into productive investments such as research and development and infrastructure as opposed to share buybacks norway ranked no 1 living standards there rose by 10 6 percent from 2008 to 2013 while the economy grew only 0 5 percent mr monck defended the idea of a globalist approach the benefits of globalization are there to see in jobs in china india and many emerging markets he said billions of people owe better lives to it he invoked klaus schwab the founder of the world economic forum what hasn t been listened to in davos is persistent warnings from people like klaus that the benefits need to be shared and that you can t have capitalism mr monck said still he acknowledged that the invitation list of insiders is by design we always want the most comprehensive political attendance in davos to help support cooperation which is what we do he said that inevitably means current serving political figures there are politicians in office now and coming to davos who reflect this emergent agenda that you ve seen in the u s for example he said leaders from poland finland portugal and even switzerland where the swiss people s party was an early example of the shift in the political landscape will be on hand this week a bevy of mr trump s advisers and members of his business council are expected to attend including anthony scaramucci who joined the s white house staff as an adviser and public liaison to government agencies and businesses he will be joined by stephen schwarzman chairman of the blackstone group and also of mr trump s president s strategic and policy forum four trump cabinet nominees have been to davos in years past rick perry energy once rex tillerson state three times robert lighthizer trade 15 times and elaine chao transportation four times a few people who were once crusaders like ms may of britain are now insiders and depending how the political winds shift more people of her ideological ilk may join the davos class in 2018 this is not the first time that the world economic forum has come under fire from critics about its globalist message in 2000 a group of more than 1 000 demonstrators carrying signs that said against the new world order smashed the windows of a mcdonald s franchise here in davos just down the road from the conference protesting open trade policies espoused by bill clinton who was speaking at the event many of today s policy makers and executives gathering here are expected to speak about the rise of populism and the need to adjust economic incentives hamdi ulukaya the chief executive of chobani the yogurt company is expected to encourage business leaders to do more to address wealth building among employees he provided shares in his company to every employee making many of them millionaires the question of course is whether those discussions can ever get beyond the theoretical for a group that is seen by many voters as out of touch with the real economic challenges that people face conversations about income inequality for example have long had a tinge of class envy as opposed to a real appreciation for the basic jobs and wages that people are seeking still with the word davos being tossed around as an epithet some politicians are staying away from the alps this year ms merkel for example has passed on attending now for two years in a row in the face of continued criticism among german voters that she is too much of a globalist so why do so many policy makers and executives still covet an invitation because davos remains the world s shop to meet leaders from all corners of the globe and despite the critiques of the gathering a remarkable amount of business both political and corporate takes place behind the scenes one thing is sure the predictions made here known as the davos consensus have a tendency to be wrong mr trump with very few exceptions was largely written off last year as a bad joke if you bother to read some of the serious analysis of trump s support you realize that it s a very fragile thing and highly unlikely to deliver what he needs in the crucial first phase of the primaries niall ferguson the historian predicted at davos in 2016 according to

       " 'berlin about five decades since the surge in modern feminism it is unlikely that most women in the united states at least would have anticipated the current political climate in which gender equality remains almost as elusive as ever and rights are under siege what is more a man criticized by many for his treatment of women will be sworn in as president of the united states on friday and in 2016 a woman still could not be elected to the job after the gamut of emotions engendered by hillary clinton s surprising loss to donald j trump women are once more confronting the big questions that have long enveloped the feminist quest put bluntly is it sexism or the system that has so far prevented a woman from becoming president of the united states and what lessons might be drawn from europe or places further afield that could help an american woman get to the top one day as members of the global elite gather this week at the world economic forum in davos switzerland gender issues in politics and beyond will be hotly debated if the fight for women s rights has taught activists one thing it is that simple questions have complex answers melanne verveer executive director of the georgetown institute for women peace and security and former ambassador at large for global women s issues under president obama said that to just look at this election through the gender lens is not to understand it fully though many women saw mrs clinton a former senator and secretary of state as the most qualified candidate other women felt no tug to help one of their own shatter a glass ceiling and instead reached a conclusion that they might be better off with a change ms verveer said i think people would like to think there has to be one good explanation said shauna lani shames an assistant professor of political science at rutgers in new jersey but there is not it s many what she called the deeply ingrained sexism of a country fond of cowboy myths and tales of the wild west is one there are others for starters look at how the united states chooses candidates selection is mostly about people dr shames said you have to as a candidate and often win a primary before the party will take note of you just the expense and time away from family involved turn many women off leaving a smaller pipeline even the basic act of asking for money essential to any political bid in the united states hurts women more she argued women hate it more than men do men tend to be in social circles where they can raise more money mrs clinton was criticized last summer when her annual sojourn in the wealthy enclaves of the hamptons became studded with mr trump made his own round of there to perhaps less attention in europe women can work their way up the ladder of their party which tends to have a distinct ideological identity and is often subsidized by government funds from which all legal parties can benefit in addition dr shames said research has shown that the proportional representation that is a cornerstone of many european political systems is far more likely to get women elected to national legislatures europeans have also been much readier to adopt quotas to bolster women s part in politics americans steeped in individualism have been reluctant to legislate in this way the concept of quotas in the u s as you know is antithetical to the american position and possibly the myth that holds that everyone pulls themselves up by their bootstraps said debbie walsh director of the center for american women and politics at rutgers of course europeans have not always proved able to use quotas to the full advantage for women in france for example where law dictates that 40 percent of candidates be female parties particularly conservative ones have often preferred to pay fines rather than find the mandated number of women joanna maycock is secretary general of the european women s lobby which brings together about 2 500 women s groups from each of the 28 european union nations and from neighbors like norway and aspiring members like turkey and serbia she said she detected a change in attitudes since mrs clinton s defeat that starkly highlighted the quirks of the american system in particular the electoral college the college affirmed mr trump s ascension to the presidency despite his loss of the popular vote ms maycock cited a workshop at the end of november that brought together about 25 american and european activists examining how to get more women into politics when we planned it we thought we would be celebrating hillary s success she said instead the meeting reflected the shock of trump a lot of the american participants were so horrified and shocked there was a big difference she said a readiness to explore other methods and reinforce the need to train women in public speaking and building networks ms walsh s center at rutgers runs nonpartisan campaign training in new jersey and assists in such training in 17 other states she reported a dramatic increase in women s signing up women are seeking a way to have a voice ms walsh said this election has made citizens men and women see things through the gender blend she added that women can have an enormous impact on their lives families identities and that they can t sit on the sidelines they have to figure out a way to get engaged in modern europe the trail to the top was blazed by the somewhat unlikely figure of margaret thatcher who was the first woman elected as prime minister in britain in 1979 theresa may is now the second with the tough task of negotiating the country s exit from the european union mrs thatcher had no outright feminist agenda and stood accused of fomenting social hardship with her conservative policies and iron will for instance to break britain s trade unions close to 40 years later similar policies of austerity are associated with chancellor angela merkel of germany often called the world s most powerful woman after 11 years in office her unwillingness to loosen europe s purse strings while germany europe s no 1 economy benefits substantially from the euro currency makes her anything but a heroine in many feminist eyes the obsession with austerity across europe has been really bad ms maycock said it hits women doubly she argued cutting public service jobs often held by women and leaving them bereft of the infrastructure care for children and seniors for instance that enables them to work over the past decade ms maycock contended austerity has been a big brake on women s empowerment we ve actually stopped progressing more or less she said citing a gender inequality index compiled by her group that showed 51 5 percent progress toward full equality 10 years ago compared with 52 5 percent now in general she said european countries with quotas tend to show an effect once the female membership of legislatures passes she said over all in europe women account for about of legislators she said the range is large in poland for instance a female prime minister beata szydlo is among 27 percent of female lawmakers in the lower house of parliament after the 2015 elections introduced a quota system but the upper house which has no such mechanism is only 13 percent women norway one of the first european countries to adopt quotas has had two female prime ministers and a female defense minister mandates 40 percent female board membership in business ms maycock pointed to recently elected female mayors in paris barcelona madrid and rome as more examples of women s getting power where it matters but in the united states dr shames said women are far more likely to be city council members than mayors and state legislators than governors on both sides of the atlantic women still have important territory to take while france has had a female defense minister and germany currently has one ursula von der leyen a married mother of seven neither britain nor the united states has entrusted defense to a woman american finance too has remained firmly in the hands of men on wall street as at the treasury and 2016 shocked many not just with mrs clinton s defeat but with the triumph of mr trump despite accusations of misogyny and with the murder of jo cox a labour party legislator who was stabbed by a man reportedly shouting britain first days before the country voted to leave the european union which ms cox opposed in democracies from australia through the united states and europe the thin pipeline of women ready to step up to the top in politics and business is an added cause for concern in the united states there are just five female governors right now and 21 women in the senate ms walsh said the bench is very small and the potential pool of candidates is really very small she said noting that most modern presidents if not mr trump have been governors or senators first that makes it doubly significant that more women are expressing an interest in entering politics after mrs clinton s defeat she said ',\n",
       " 'melbourne australia so ivan are you calling andy sir ivan lendl paused and then laughed which would surely seem strange to those who know him only as andy murray s coach in the front row of the players box definitely not lendl said chuckling some more before heading off down the crowded main hallway inside rod laver arena at the australian open clearly not much has changed in the murray camp since his remarkable stretch run to the no 1 ranking and a knighthood in 2016 he is still tough on himself on court and on the changeovers still andy not sir andy to his peers and mentor in chief lendl still deadpan and droll with his voice that sounds as if it emanates from a mine shaft asked on monday by the interviewer john fitzgerald how murray s wife kim was handling the transition to lady kim murray said no more swearing during my matches for anyone who saw that a few years ago he was referring to kim s courtside language during his semifinal victory over tomas berdych at the 2015 australian open her tirade did not go unnoticed and she returned for the final cheekily wearing a shirt that read parental advisory explicit content presumably lady kim won t be wearing that sort of thing in the players box from here on either or at least she wasn t on monday i haven t found it distracting really murray said of the knighthood i mean i found out about it four or five weeks ago maybe if it happened a day or so two days before the tournament but i ve had enough time to get my head around it just as he has had plenty of time to prepare himself for the role of no 1 however long it lasts i asked him on monday after his stuttering 5 victory over illya marchenko if there had been any downside to no 1 thinking he might bring up extra demands or burdens no he said it s been great i think because it s taken me so long to get there obviously i want to try to stay there but also i feel like i m mature enough now to handle it maybe if it happens when you re very young you might feel extra pressures the responsibilities might feel a bit much but i think because i m much older and more mature it s been good the conventional tennis wisdom is that it is harder to hang on at the top than to reach the top i hope not murray said but for anyone who believes that he now has nowhere to go but down that is hardly true in australia he has reached five singles finals in melbourne and lost all five no man has done so well at any grand slam tournament without breaking through to win the title others have lost five finals in the same major event including lendl who lost five at the united states open but he also won three bill johnston lost six finals at the united states championships but won the event twice john bromwich lost five finals at the australian championships in the era but won the title twice too murray at 29 is in unfortunately uncharted territory all the more so because novak djokovic ended his own long run of frustration at the french open last year by finally taking the title after reaching four semifinals and three finals look it s still a remarkable record five slam finals in australia and deep down i think it means an enormous amount to andy to finally complete the puzzle said roger rasheed the australian who once coached lleyton hewitt when hewitt was chasing the title here without success but hewitt reached only one final in melbourne murray is here and has a better winning percentage at the australian open than at any other grand slam tournament except wimbledon andy s been so close rasheed said what more does he have to do well it s not a matter of big changes it s just been a matter of points and the moments it s a matter of the opposition too the first of murray s australian open defeats in the final came against roger federer in 2010 the last four came against djokovic in 2011 2013 2015 and 2016 andy played roger in his prime and has been playing novak in his prime rasheed said it s a handful of points changing the way the match falls andy s showing he s in his prime now he just needs to get there and roll the dice again murray s timing may still not be quite right he played a great deal of tennis down the stretch in 2016 and was beaten by djokovic in a final in doha qatar to start this season freshness just might be a factor down the stretch as well as djokovic s eagerness to restore the pecking order but it does not seem quite right in light of their abilities that djokovic has six australian open titles and murray has not even one he broke down in tears after losing to federer in 2010 he stared vacantly into space after losses to djokovic and sportingly came up with the right words amid major disappointment and yet he insisted on monday that his emotions were not mixed when he thought about this tournament honestly they re totally positive said murray who plays andrey rublev in the second round on wednesday i ve had a lot of tough losses here for sure but i love it here played some great matches as well but just haven t managed to win the final but you know i keep coming back to try i ll keep doing that until i m done but i still feel like i ve got a few years left to try and do it he is by any measure due for a change of fortune in melbourne and if you like your sports with foreshadowing the only other top tennis player to receive a knighthood was sir norman brookes the australian star of the early 20th century guess whose name has been given to the trophy awarded to the men s champion at the australian open ',\n",
       " 'washington the f b i arrested the wife of the man who carried out a deadly terrorist attack in orlando fla and charged her with obstructing the investigation of the mass shooting law enforcement officials said on monday noor salman whose husband omar mateen killed 49 people and wounded dozens in an orlando nightclub that was popular with gays was also charged with aiding and abetting by providing material support the officials said she was taken into custody by f b i agents at her home outside san francisco where she had been living with her young son prosecutors had been weighing charges against her for months in the aftermath of the attack by her husband on june 12 2016 investigators interviewed ms salman for hours after the attack and came to believe she was not telling the truth about her husband s plans to carry out the rampage a justice department spokesman said ms salman would make her initial appearance on tuesday morning in federal court in oakland calif the justice department s decision to prosecute ms salman 30 ends part of the mystery that has surrounded her since the first days after the attack when she became a central subject of the investigation into her husband noor salman had no foreknowledge nor could she predict what omar mateen intended to do that tragic night said her lawyer linda moreno noor has told her story of abuse at his hands we believe it is misguided and wrong to prosecute her and that it dishonors the memories of the victims to punish an innocent person the aiding and abetting a terrorism charge suggests that prosecutors believe that ms salman helped him in some way either before or after the terrorist attack the decision to charge her is not without risks for prosecutors if the case goes to trial prosecutors will have to contend with a jury that could be sympathetic to ms salman who said she was in an abusive relationship and living in fear in an interview last year with the new york times ms salman said she was unaware of everything in connection with the attack ms salman said she had accompanied her husband to orlando with their child once when he scouted the club but did not know the purpose of the trip on the day her husband drove to orlando she claimed he said he was going to visit a friend named nemo who lived in florida but nemo was not living in florida at the time a fact ms salman said she did not know she also said she had no reason to suspect that ammunition he bought in the days leading up to the attack was to be used in the shooting given that her husband was a security guard who frequently purchased ammunition on the day of the shooting she bought her husband a father s day card expecting him to return that evening her lawyers believe that supports her story that she did not know about the attack during his rampage mr mateen used facebook to pledge his allegiance to the islamic state president obama has said that mr mateen took in extremist information and propaganda over the internet and became radicalized federal investigators do not believe that mr mateen who was 29 and who was killed by the police after the shooting received any specific training or support from the islamic state part of their inquiry has focused on whether anyone in the united states assisted in his plans for the attack there has perhaps been no figure more central to those questions than ms salman who grew up in an home in rodeo calif near san francisco in rodeo on a diverse block populated by chinese indian korean and mexican families neighbors recalled a younger ms salman as warm and kind ms salman married mr mateen in a ceremony near her childhood home in northern california a second marriage for both after the wedding ms salman moved to fort pierce fla where she and mr mateen lived in a condominium complex their marriage in 2011 caused consternation among some of ms salman s relatives mostly because of her palestinian heritage and mr mateen s ancestral ties to afghanistan ms salman said in the interview with the times that her husband beat her repeatedly and verbally abused her members of mr mateen s family who have tried to shield ms salman from public scrutiny have said they believe she did nothing improper she is shocked that poor lady seddique mateen mr mateen s father said in june 2016 and she doesn t know anything the orlando police chief john w mina said in a statement that he was glad to see that ms salman had been arrested nothing can erase the pain we all feel about the senseless and brutal murders of 49 of our neighbors friends family members and loved ones the chief said but today there is some relief in knowing that someone will be held accountable for that horrific crime in two recent mass shootings prosecutors have brought charges against people with ties to the attackers in south carolina a friend of dylann s roof who was convicted of killing nine people on june 17 2015 in a charleston church pleaded guilty in april to lying to federal investigators and misprision of a felony or failing to inform authorities that a felony had been committed the friend did not testify against mr roof who was sentenced to death last week in 2015 the federal authorities in california brought charges against a neighbor of the husband and wife who killed 14 people and wounded 22 others in san bernardino the man who bought the rifles used in the attack on dec 2 2015 was accused of lying on forms filled out in connection with the purchase although he was also accused of planning a terrorist attack several years ago the man was not charged with having a direct role in the san bernardino rampage however federal prosecutors in the summer of 2014 declined to prosecute katherine russell the wife of

       " 'for norwegians the sight of dozens of american marines traipsing through the snow in military fatigues the first time foreign forces have been posted to their country s territory since world war ii may have brought a welcomed sense of security but it also harked back to a dark era of the cold war that many had hoped to forget a united states military plane on monday delivered most of the 330 marines to a garrison in vaernes in central norway a deployment that norwegian officials said had been carried out by the united states as part of a bilateral agreement it was the latest effort by the united states and its european allies to buttress their defenses against a resurgent russia which condemned the move despite being generally welcomed across the political spectrum the arrival of the marines from camp lejeune n c shown on norwegian television dragging their suitcases through the snow also provoked some jitters in norway a wealthy country that is a member of nato but not the european union the nordic state has long prided itself on its independence but the deployment recalled a cold war era in which russian intrigue grabbed headlines and norwegians lived in fear of soviet hegemony neuroses about russia continue to exert influence in norwegian popular culture the political television thriller okkupert depicts a future in which norway is occupied by russia and with the backing of the european union takes over the country s oil production such fears have been magnified in recent years with murky sightings of submarines across the region that have stoked concern about russian espionage and military intervention in october 2014 an unidentified vessel spotted off the stockholm archipelago spurred sweden s largest mobilization since the cold war and accusations that russia was spying on the country the episode called the hunt for reds in october in the swedish news media included unsubstantiated reports of a man in black spotted wading near the vessel it deeply unsettled the nation even as the kremlin issued strenuous denials and accused stockholm of scaremongering then in april 2015 the sudden appearance of an underwater vessel in finland which shares a long border with russia prompted the navy to fire depth charges the first such warning in more than 10 years and lithuania on monday said it plans to use european union funding to build a fence on the border with russia s highly militarised kaliningrad exclave to increase security and prevent smuggling according to agence construction of the 32 million fence will start this spring and will be finished by the end of the year said interior minister eimutis misiunas the reasons are both economic to prevent smuggling and geopolitical to strengthen the e u s external border mr misiunas said it would not stop tanks but it will be difficult to climb over in moscow the deployment of united states marines in norway has been met with disdain after plans for the deployment were confirmed in october frants klintsevich a deputy chairman of russia s defense and security committee in the upper chamber of parliament was quoted by russian news media as saying that the kremlin viewed the marines as a direct military threat he also said the deployment made norway a potential target for moscow s powerful arsenal which includes nuclear weapons on monday the russian authorities reiterated their discontent maria zakharova a spokeswoman for the russian foreign ministry said in an interview with nrk the norwegian public broadcaster that the move certainly will not improve relations the relationship between norway and russia is put to a test now she said instead of developing economic cooperation norway is choosing to deploy united states troops on norwegian soil the deployment of the marines who will be stationed hundreds of miles from the border with russia comes as countries across europe have been reinforcing their defenses out of concern over an increasingly assertive russia last week a convoy from an american armored brigade crossed the german border into poland the first installment of what are expected to be several thousand nato troops to be based across eastern europe relations between the west and russia in the nordic region and beyond have been tense since that country s annexation of crimea in march 2014 and the outbreak of conflict between government forces and rebels in eastern ukraine at the same time donald j trump fanned alarm in europe in the months leading to his election victory when he questioned whether the united states should automatically defend nato allies if they were attacked and predicated american support on the willingness of countries in the alliance to pay their fair share for military protection in norway some lamented that the marines arrival stood against the country s traditions and threatened to make it a target of its much larger neighbor morten harper a leftist member of the local assembly that governs the area housing the military base said the marines arrival was ensnaring norway into the united states power struggle with russia we see an ever more tense foreign policy situation he said if there ever was to be a major conflict between the great powers in the future this makes us a more likely bomb target after world war ii norway abandoned its neutral stance by joining nato in 1949 and committing to the alliance s doctrine of collective defense but the country which shares a northern border with russia sought to placate moscow by pledging that no foreign troops would be allowed to be permanently stationed on its soil norway s defense minister ine eriksen soreide said in an interview on sunday that russia had no reason to be alarmed by the marines presence she said that the deployment did not flout the restriction because the marines were there on a trial period that was the marines will take part in military exercises involving skiing and surviving in arctic temperatures to hone their abilities to fight in tough winter conditions it is part of a bilateral agreement between oslo and washington but norwegian officials said that in the case of a conflict the troops would probably fall under nato s command hedda b langemyr of the norwegian peace council a group made up of several nongovernmental organizations said the deployment threatened to aggravate tension between norway and russia while breaching norway s tradition of not allowing permanent foreign troops on its soil it might give the hawks in moscow arguments for a continued arms race she said

nearly seven years and her sentence was by far the longest punishment ever imposed in the united states for a leak conviction at the same time that mr obama commuted the sentence of ms manning a

a joint statement nancy hollander and vince ward two lawyers who have been representing ms manning in appealing her conviction and sentence and who filed the commutation application praised the decision ms manning is the in the history of the united states they said her sentence for disclosing information that served the public interest and never caused harm to the united states was always excessive and we re delighted that justice is being served in the form of this commutation in recent days the white house had signaled that mr obama was seriously considering granting ms manning s commutation application in contrast to a pardon application submitted on behalf of the other leaker of the era edward j snowden the former intelligence contractor who disclosed archives of surveillance files and is living as a fugitive in russia asked about the two clemency applications on friday the white house spokesman josh earnest discussed the pretty stark difference between ms manning s case for mercy and mr snowden s while their offenses were similar he said there were some important differences chelsea manning is somebody who went through the military criminal justice process was exposed to due process was found guilty was sentenced for her crimes and she acknowledged wrongdoing he said mr snowden fled into the arms of an adversary and has sought refuge in a country that most recently made a concerted effort to undermine confidence in our democracy mr earnest also noted that while the documents ms manning provided to wikileaks were damaging to national security the ones mr snowden disclosed were far more serious and far more dangerous none of the documents ms manning disclosed were classified above the merely secret level ms manning was still known as bradley manning when she deployed with her unit to iraq in late 2009 there she worked as a intelligence analyst helping her unit assess insurgent activity in the area it was patrolling a role that gave her access to a classified computer network she copied hundreds of thousands of military incident logs from the afghanistan and iraq wars which among other things exposed abuses of detainees by iraqi military officers working with american forces and showed that civilian deaths in the iraq war were probably much higher than official estimates the files she copied also included about 250 000 diplomatic cables from american embassies showing sensitive deals and conversations dossiers detailing intelligence assessments of guantánamo detainees held without trial and a video of an american helicopter attack in baghdad in which two reuters journalists were killed among others she decided to make all these files public as she wrote at the time in the hope that they would incite worldwide discussion debates and reforms wikileaks disclosed them working with traditional news organizations including the new york times bringing notoriety to the group and its founder julian assange the disclosures set off a frantic scramble as obama administration officials sought to minimize any potential harm including getting to safety some foreigners in dangerous countries who were identified as having helped american troops or diplomats prosecutors however presented no evidence that anyone had been killed because of the leaks at her ms manning confessed in detail to her actions and apologized saying she had not intended to put anyone at risk and noting that she had been dealing with a lot of issues at the time she made her decision testimony showed that she had been in a mental and emotional crisis as she came to grips amid the stress of a war zone with the fact that she was not merely gay but had gender dysphoria she had been behaving erratically including angry outbursts and lapsing into catatonia midsentence at one point she had emailed a photograph of herself in a woman s wig to her supervisor prosecutors said that because the secret material was made available for publication on the internet anyone including al qaeda could read it and they accused ms manning of treason charging her with multiple counts under the espionage act as well as with aiding the enemy a potential capital offense although they said they would not seek her execution ms manning confessed and pleaded guilty to a lesser version of those charges without any deal to cap her sentence but prosecutors pressed forward with a trial and won convictions on the more serious versions of those charges a military judge acquitted her of aiding the enemy in her commutation application ms manning said she had not imagined that she would be sentenced to the extreme term of 35 years a term for which there was no historical precedent there have been only a handful of leak cases and most sentence are one to three years after her sentencing ms manning announced that she was transgender and changed her name to chelsea the military under pressure from a lawsuit filed on her behalf by chase strangio of the american civil liberties union has permitted her to partly transition to life as a woman including giving her hormones and letting her wear women s undergarments and light cosmetics but it has not let her grow her hair longer than male military standards citing security risks and ms manning said she had yet to be permitted to see a surgeon about the possibility of sex reassignment surgery until recently the military discharged transgender soldiers in june secretary of defense ashton b carter changed that policy and said the military would instead provide treatment for them eventually including such surgery if doctors said it was necessary donald j trump mocked that change as excessively politically correct raising the possibility that he will rescind it but even if he does ms manning will soon no longer be subject to the military s control ',\n",

leaker and the prison s most unusual inmate she is serving the longest sentence ever imposed for disclosing government secrets 35 years and her status as a celebrity of sorts and an incarcerated transgender woman presents continuing difficulties for the military during the day ms manning who was an army intelligence analyst known as bradley manning when she disclosed archives of secret military and diplomatic files to wikileaks in 2010 builds picture frames and furniture in the prison wood shop in the evenings before the 10 05 p m lockdown she reads through streams of letters including from antisecrecy enthusiasts who view her as a i am always busy i have a backlog of things to do legal administrative press inquiries and writing lots of writing ms manning wrote in response to questions submitted by the times because the army does not permit her to speak directly to journalists being me is a job but ms manning who is struggling to transition to life as a woman while enduring a bleak existence at a male military prison has asked president obama to commute the remainder of her sentence before he leaves office next week she poses particular challenges as a prisoner with a volunteer support network that helps bring global attention to her treatment fragile mental state she twice tried to commit suicide in 2016 and need for treatment that the military has no experience providing her request comes as the world is again focused on wikileaks and its founder julian assange whom her leaks made famous the organization last year published clinton campaign emails obtained in a hacking as part of what american intelligence officials claim was a covert russian operation aimed at tilting the election to donald j trump ms manning declined to discuss wikileaks saying only that her decision to send documents to it was neither an endorsement nor an affiliation it also comes at a time of flux in the military s policies on gender identity last june the obama administration rescinded a ban on transgender people serving in the military and began overhauling its practices which eventually would include providing gender reassignment surgery but mr trump has derided the lifting of the ban as politically correct raising the possibility that his administration may roll back the changes the white house declined to comment on ms manning s commutation request the army declined to comment about her situation at fort leavenworth citing privacy laws a military prosecutor had called ms manning a traitor at her 2013 and officials have said the disclosures disrupted government operations and put people at risk although prosecutors did not claim anyone was killed because of them in a statement accompanying her petition asking mr obama to reduce her sentence to the nearly seven years she already has served ms manning now 29 said she never intended to hurt anyone and pleaded for a chance to start her life over i need help she wrote i am living through a cycle of anxiety anger hopelessness loss and depression i cannot focus i cannot sleep i attempted to take my own life on aug 22 2013 the day after her sentencing for sending documents to wikileaks ms manning s lawyer read a statement on the today show announcing that she was female wanted to be called chelsea rather than bradley and would seek hormone therapy to observers of her this was no surprise her motivation for leaking hundreds of thousands of files she had copied from a classified computer network while serving in iraq as she wrote at the time was hope that they would spark worldwide discussion debates and reforms but at her trial she apologized and noted that she was dealing with a lot of issues when she had made that decision testimony showed that she had been in a mental and emotional crisis as she came to grips in the stress of a war zone with the fact that she was not merely gay as she had believed while growing up in oklahoma but had gender dysphoria a disconnect between one s gender identity and sex assigned at birth in the months before her leaks and may 2010 arrest she had been behaving erratically and emailed a picture of herself wearing a woman s wig to her supervisor the military sent ms manning to serve out her sentence as a inmate at the fort leavenworth disciplinary barracks its main prison for male inmates court documents show that ms manning has had counseling sessions with a prison psychologist dr ellen galloway at least once a week and military authorities have over time allowed her access to some treatments doctors prescribed for her gender dysphoria in part because of pressure from a lawsuit filed by chase strangio a lawyer for the american civil liberties union in september 2014 she can now wear female prison undergarments including a sports bra and subdued cosmetics in early 2015 she was permitted to get speech therapy to feminize the tone and pitch of her voice and began hormone therapy prescribed mr strangio said by an endocrinologist brought in from the military s walter reed hospital since then ms manning wrote she has developed breasts and curvier hips there have been significant changes since i ve been taking the hormones and i am happy with them she said but citing security risks the military rejected the recommendation of an outside psychologist who said she should be permitted to further feminize her appearance by growing her hair longer than male military standards mr strangio is helping her challenge that restriction plaintiff feels like a freak and a weirdo not because having short hair makes a person less of a woman but because for her it undermines specifically recommended treatment and sends the message to everyone that she is not a real woman he wrote in a court filing she is getting hormones but it sounds like the inability to socially transition or to have surgery could be contributing to suicidality especially when she is looking at decades in prison and thus a certain hopelessness about whether that might ever be available for her said dan karasic a university of california san francisco psychiatrist and the chairman of the american psychiatric association s work group on gender dysphoria he cautioned that he had not examined her the military turned down a request by the new york times to visit the facility but an army spokesman wayne hall provided written answers from the army corrections command to questions posed by the times from which a sketch of her environment emerged ms manning s cell like others at fort leavenworth contains a bed toilet sink locker storage bin chair and desk according to the army she showers in a nearby communal bathroom with individual stalls she has no access to the internet but says she receives at least a couple hundred pieces of mail every week the army does not permit her to see people who did not know her before her incarceration so she is not allowed to meet with a handful of volunteers who have formed an informal network of supporters but she calls one of them daily a volunteer who relayed questions from the times to her asked not to be named citing security concerns ms manning said she recently finished reading superintelligence paths dangers strategies a book about artificial intelligence by the swedish philosopher nick bostrom and 1q84 a dystopian novel by haruki murakami she is interested in efforts to develop stronger encryption and has been going through the princeton companion to mathematics she also said she reads women s athletic fashion and lifestyle magazines like shape vogue vanity fair and cosmopolitan her cell door has a window looking onto a central day room with tables chairs pay phones and televisions for a time ms manning played dungeons dragons with a few fellow inmates but she said she had had no time in recent months she eats meals with other inmates in a dining facility and works on a team at the wood shop the roughly 424 inmates held at fort leavenworth with ms manning include men accused of routine crimes as well as some who drew public attention including nidal hasan convicted in a 2009 mass shooting at fort hood and held on the prison s death row wing and robert bales who murdered 16 afghans in kandahar and was sentenced to life without parole in august 2013 ms manning declined to say much about the guards or fellow inmates other than to say that they have never bullied or attacked her it s best to keep to yourself and try not to get involved in any drama she wrote it s a little harder for me to keep to myself since the staff is constantly watching me and those that interact with me but i m used to it by now i don t feel threatened by the other prisoners i have friends her special status at fort leavenworth is evident nancy hollander one of the lawyers working on the appeal of her conviction and sentence said the army built a special secure information facility in a windowless basement room so she could meet with them and discuss documents she leaked while ms manning said she could not say on her monitored phone calls anything critical of the prison or the current administration or i can get charged for violation of a lawful general order her supporters pay close attention to her treatment scrutiny of the military s struggles to deal with ms manning go back to her confinement at the quantico va brig after her arrest when she was held for months in isolation shackled during exercise and sometimes stripped of clothing and glasses to prevent her from harming herself even after a prison psychologist said such steps were unnecessary a military judge ruled that the treatment had been illegal at leavenworth after a minor disagreement with a guard in 2015 officials punished her among other things for medical misuse because they found a tube of toothpaste in her cell that was past its expiration date her supporters publicized the incident in september her supporters issued a news release saying she was on a hunger strike because of an overzealous administrative scrutiny and lack of progress in getting more treatment she resumed eating after five days mr strangio said an official told her she would be eligible for the same medical treatment as transgender soldiers suggesting she would eventually be permitted to proceed with surgery but months have passed and ms manning wrote that she has not seen a surgeon later in september a prison board disciplined ms manning for the disruption a july suicide attempt had caused the punishment solitary confinement while in isolation in october she tried again to kill herself by choking herself on a piece of clothing according to a support network member before guards intervened about a week further into that stint in solitary she experienced a bizarre episode in which four people impersonating guards simulated breaking into the prison one night and pretended to kill her regular guards filling her with fear according to an account she filed with the army inspector general a military official denied her account dr stuart grassian a specialist in the psychological effects of solitary confinement said her description is consistent with hallucinations often experienced by unstable people placed in isolation now with 28 years of her sentence to go and uncertainty over whether the trump administration will deny her surgery ms manning is hoping mr obama will take mercy on her and free her from military prison which goes by the acronym u s d b i am not asking for a pardon of my conviction i understand that the various collateral consequences of the conviction will stay on my record forever she wrote in her commutation application i am merely asking for a first chance to live my life outside the u s d b as the person i was

       " 'washington in one way at least donald j trump has already surpassed all of his recent predecessors it took barack obama 18 months in the white house for his approval rating to slip to 44 percent in gallup polling and it took george w bush 4½ years to fall that far mr trump got there before even being sworn in indeed mr trump will take office on friday with less popular support than any new president in modern times according to an array of surveys a sign that he has failed to rally americans behind him beyond the base that helped him win in november rather than a unifying moment his transition to power has seen a continuation of the polarization of the election last year where other presidents used the weeks before their inauguration to put the animosities of the campaign behind them and to try to knit the country together again mr trump has approached the interregnum as if he were a television wrestling star he has taken on a civil rights icon a hollywood actress intelligence agencies defense contractors european leaders and president obama the healing theme common at this stage in the presidential cycle is absent he seems to want to engage with every windmill that he can find rather than focus on the large aspect of assuming the most important position on earth senator john mccain republican of arizona said on cnn on tuesday and obviously apparently according to the polls many americans are not happy with that approach when he has not even assumed the presidency two polls out on tuesday one by cnn and orc and another by the washington post and abc news found that just 40 percent of americans approved of mr trump s performance heading into the inauguration on friday nbc news and the wall street journal put his approval rating at 44 percent calling it the lowest rating ever for an incoming president by comparison shortly after their inaugurations mr obama was at 68 percent and mr bush was at 57 percent in gallup surveys both used the time after their initial victories to preach a message of inclusion and to extend a hand to their opposition even if it did not ultimately last mr trump s advisers said privately that his unexpected rise to power showed that such traditional barometers did not matter as much anymore if polls were to be believed he would not have been president they said still the anemic numbers clearly irritated mr trump who lashed out on tuesday the same people who did the phony election polls and were so wrong are now doing approval rating polls he wrote on twitter they are rigged just like before although polling in several midwest battleground states failed to accurately reflect the actual results on election day national polls generally came within a percentage point of the actual popular vote which hillary clinton won with 48 percent to mr trump s 46 percent for mr trump the worry about approval ratings would be less about what it might mean for the next election still years away but about how such numbers are interpreted by members of congress who historically have been more deferential to popular presidents than unpopular ones every president starts off with a account with congress that eventually draws down said phil schiliro who was mr obama s white house legislative director in his first term as approval ratings drop the account sinks very quickly and that makes it much harder to bring congress along on the president s priorities steve israel a democrat who represented new york in the house said the biggest challenge for mr trump might be with nervous members of his own party right now trump s numbers are kryptonite for 21 house republicans in districts that he lost he said so not only does he begin with low poll numbers he begins with a significant potential bloc of resistance in his own caucus but mr trump has shown that he intends to lead more through force of personality than through the breadth of his coalition brash and uninhibited he seeks out enemies and allows few slights to go unanswered he has repaired bridges with some critics like mitt romney but has made only sporadic efforts to reach out to parts of the public that have not supported him his strongest supporters cheer his pugnacious style and he argues that it has gotten results like when house republicans backed off plans to undercut the authority of the office of congressional ethics or major employers reversed plans to move jobs overseas after he wrote on twitter about his disapproval with all of the jobs i am bringing back into the u s even before taking office with all of the new auto plants coming back into our country and with the massive cost reductions i have negotiated on military purchases and more i believe the people are seeing big stuff mr trump wrote on twitter on tuesday for many years presidents and their advisers quaked at polls that showed a drop in their ratings fearful that it would hurt their ability to command the stage and to enact their agendas the last two presidents governed for long stretches with less than majority support which clearly limited their capacity to advance major legislation but they both also demonstrated that they could still make at least some progress mr bush never had the support of more than 50 percent of americans for nearly his entire second term and fell into the 20s before leaving office still he ignored poll numbers and the opposition of democrats to send reinforcements to iraq to turn around a losing war mr obama never fell as far but he went for many months below 50 percent and turned to his executive authority to enact policies on immigration and the environment he rebounded in public standing in the last few months and will leave office at 56 percent in the poll near his highest marks some republicans now say mr trump has rewritten the rule book polling more and more is a false god said ron kaufman the white house political director under president george bush and a longtime republican strategist we all play to it but it s a false god i just think it s no longer reliable as a judge mary matalin who was a top counselor to vice president dick cheney who ignored his own low approval ratings while in office to focus on advancing his national security agenda said mr trump has ushered in a new political paradigm that has upended assumptions trump has exposed the inadequacy and fallibility of domestic political strategy of governing by polls and contrived expectations she said in the new trump world it has already been proven prima facie absurd to presume personal approval numbers to be more than policy approval ',\n",

marketplaces or through its expansion of medicaid and enrollment has continued to grow about 11 5 million people have signed up for marketplace plans or had their coverage automatically renewed for this year nearly 300 000 more than at this time last year the obama administration said this month but the popularity bounce never came public opinion remains deeply divided with the law no more popular today than when it was passed in december according to a monthly tracking poll by the kaiser family foundation 46 percent of americans had unfavorable views of the law up from 40 percent in

2013 more recently with premiums soaring and insurers defecting from the affordable care act marketplace in many states democrats were hard put to defend the law which was passed without any

meniscus of her right knee in an interview ms podjan said she started freaking out after the election and sent an email to ms stabenow she said she was flabbergasted when she heard back from the senator s office ms podjan said that the premium for an insurance policy covering her and her husband was about 1 000 a month but that they paid just 62 after receiving government subsidies provided

future of their health care coverage i heard from a man in orono his wife was diagnosed with cancer this year on top of everything his family is now dealing with he is terrified that his family will lose coverage if there is a repeal whether such concerns reflect a change in public opinion is difficult to say over the past six years republicans have collected stories from hundreds of constituents

representative pat tiberi republican of ohio reported that a constituent named kimberly had difficulty obtaining treatment for a brain tumor because she said virtually no doctors take the marketplace insurance the differing accounts are not necessarily in contradiction some people have benefited from the law while others have seen their coverage disrupted republicans said the obama administration had been slow to recognize and acknowledge problems with the affordable care act administration officials said insurance rate increases of 25 percent or more were not a significant problem because people could get subsidies to help defray the cost even though millions of people buying insurance on their own do not receive subsidies the administration insisted that insurance markets were stable and vibrant even as large insurers pulled out of affordable care act exchanges where they were losing hundreds of millions of dollars in 2015 the administration said that claims data show healthier consumers in the exchanges but some insurers disputed that assessment saying they had not seen an influx of healthy people to help cover the costs of sick people ',\n",

from cartagena colombia in early december and biden was sitting in a black leather seat with a binder in his lap it contained the speech he had given at the democratic national convention in july he told me he had been rereading it he began reciting aloud if you live in neighborhoods like the one jill and i grew up in if you worry about your job and getting decent pay his voice accelerated if you worry about your children s education if you re taking care of an elderly parent there s only one person in this race who he looked up at me and sighed i wish to hell i d just kept saying the exact same thing biden was afflicted with regret he was sorry that on the campaign trail he had spoken so often about donald trump s unfitness for office and not enough about what hillary clinton would do for the middle class he was sorry he didn t push harder inside the white house for a tax cut and he was still torn over his decision not to run for president a race that he said would have been brutal but that he also believed he could have won i spoke with biden intermittently in the months before and after election day and i had no doubt as to why he didn t jump in he was still corny gabby lovable uncle joe the guy who once said stand up chuck let em see you to a man in a wheelchair but nearly every speech and interview now included some moving mention of his son beau who died of brain cancer in 2015 and how much biden was doing and intended to continue to do for the rest of his life to speed the search for cancer cures i saw biden cry in manchester n h in october when holding an infant that he was told was named after beau i saw him near tears in west mifflin pa the weekend before the election when he was joined onstage by the former pittsburgh steelers franco harris and mel blount which reminded him of the footballs the team owner sent to young beau and his brother hunter in the hospital after they were injured in the 1972 car accident that killed biden s first wife and baby girl on his deathbed beau advised his father to run but many friends including president obama didn t think he was up to it emotionally and the vice president finally agreed for all that s important to me in almost a sacred sense he told me mournfully the decision was unavoidable the family was broken and i was more broken than i thought i was how broken i don t know what i d do if i was in a debate and someone said you re doing this because of your son u2009 he told me one late november day in his west wing office i might have walked over and kicked his ass and yet minutes later he was standing at his desk fidgeting and replaying what might have been in 2016 the south carolina primary would have given him a strong start he said citing his internal polls there hard to believe but i was more popular with blacks than barack was biden clearly loathes the new president he said during the campaign that if he and trump were in high school he d take him behind the gym for the way he bragged about groping women trump reminded him of the bullies who teased him as a child on account of his stutter calling him but the politician who has long believed all politics is personal wants to keep it impersonal with trump the president and i have concluded that there s no value in making that ad hominem argument he told me of obama it gets you nowhere biden wasn t shocked that hillary clinton lost he had noticed before the election that trump was connecting with the people he grew up with in pennsylvania this shaped his thoughts on how democrats should respond when the subject of

legislation biden was furious about it and began attacking helms to mike mansfield the democratic senate majority leader puffing on his pipe mansfield asked biden if he knew that helms and his wife had adopted a disabled boy no one else would take question a man s judgment not his motives mansfield instructed biden who was invited by helms decades later to give his eulogy is convinced that absorbing mansfield s advice is what allowed him to work with senate republicans during the obama years to negotiate the approval of the new start treaty the end of don t ask don t tell and the expansion of the tax credit among other accomplishments his approach to trump he said wouldn t be fundamentally different it falls in that category biden told me it s one thing to say i think the proposal on the following is a serious mistake i think it s gonna do the following damage it s another thing to say the guy s a fucking idiot and he is an egomaniac who s a whatever u2009 biden suggested he might lobby former republican colleagues when circumstances generate blowback among mainstream republicans he remains in the shrinking camp that believes trump may yet step up at least a bit to the demands of high office his hope is that trump s sense of grandeur is so immense that he d rather succeed than unleash these forces given how many trump voters would lose their insurance under full repeal of the affordable care act he may well back off of repealing it biden said as for the rest of his own administration s legacy he said i m not prepared to bet my granddaughter s college tuition but it s less likely to be undone than frayed on the edges biden s biggest worry is that trump for all his bluster could be a global bystander unwilling to engage a messy world with anything more than the question i get everywhere is is american leadership going to continue u2009 he told me on air force two if trump just stays behind the lines hands off it could be very ugly very very ugly in july the president of latvia asked biden to fly there as soon as possible and give a televised speech assuring the baltic states that the united states would fulfill its nato obligations and defend them against a russian invasion he did so emphatically but his promises offer little comfort day the prospect of vladimir putin fulfilling his dream of russian hegemony over eastern europe is not far from biden s mind now if we walk away hungary poland even the baltic states these guys all start to hedge their bets he said biden s national security adviser colin kahl who was with the vice president on the plane interjected to outline the contradictions in trump s emerging foreign policy if the united states is going to be more cooperative with russia and bashar s syria but more confrontational with iran kahl asked how will trump handle them joining together to fight isis it s like a rubik s cube trying to figure this guy out biden sighed we have no freakin idea what he s gonna do when they were senate colleagues and biden was chairman of the foreign relations committee biden thought obama was in too much of a hurry and obama found the chairman a tad condescending but in the white house the two men became exceptionally close there was never a point obama told me recently where i thought he was distancing himself from me or positioning himself never been a time when he wasn t telling me something he really thought their families too drew together family has been central for us that s our baseline obama told me we both feel freer to do what we think is right because if it doesn t work out our families will still love us biden later told friends that he thought the president was sincerely looking out for him in 2015 when he advised him not to run though he also felt obama had grown fond of the bright mark he could leave on history by passing the baton from the first black president to the first female president the big question now is when and how they will the arena obama has already said that unlike george w bush he won t refrain from commenting on his successor biden may go further amid discussion of resistance to trump he surprised me with talk of 2020 when he ll turn 78 i ll run the vice president deadpanned if i can walk three days later he informed the washington press corps that he wasn t joking biden isn t likely to run but keeping the door ajar gives him a bigger voice in democratic party debates the one that worries him most is over repositioning to win back trump voters he has little patience with democrats who want to move either left or right u2009 we gotta move to the center we gotta move to those white guys we gotta move to those people or we gotta double down on the social agenda u2009 it s a false choice he said they are totally compatible i have never said anything to the a c l u that i wouldn t say to the chamber of commerce this was the vision of the democratic party to which biden had dedicated his career amtrak joe famously commuted every day from wilmington to washington three hours for 36 years he told me that as the train neared baltimore he habitually peered into the rapidly passing homes close to the tracks a flip book of families of various backgrounds who might have recognized themselves in his convention speech i wonder what the conversation at the dinner table is he told me sometimes he saw his own family in the early 1960s in those houses he imagines the families struggles with everyday expenses u2009 honey we need a new set of tires but you gotta get another 20 000 miles out of them that s the goddamn discussion people are having that s their lives before the election biden had begun to map out what his plans would look like soon he would be back on amtrak riding to and from a institute bearing his name at the university of pennsylvania and a center at the university of delaware and continuing the cancer moonshot a initiative marshaling resources in government and the private sector to accelerate cancer research in the meantime he ll help play defense against trump even if the democratic party didn t want me i m not walking away he said i ve worked on this stuff my whole life after air force two touched down on the tarmac in wilmington i asked him about a line he liked to use before the election so do you still believe what your grandfather said that god looks out for drunken irishmen and the united states of america biden said he wasn t sure about the irishmen but he was about the country i have to believe that he said there s no sense being in this business unless you re an optimist ',\n",
       " 'not since lincoln has there been a president as fundamentally shaped in his life convictions and outlook on the world by reading and writing as barack obama last friday seven days before his departure from the white house mr obama sat down in the oval office and talked about the indispensable role that books have played during his presidency and throughout his life from his peripatetic and sometimes lonely boyhood when these worlds that were portable provided companionship to his youth when they helped him to figure out who he was what he thought and what was important during his eight years in the white house in a noisy era of information overload extreme partisanship and reactions books were a sustaining source of ideas and inspiration and gave him a renewed appreciation for the complexities and ambiguities of the human condition at a time when events move so quickly and so much information is transmitted he said reading gave him the ability to occasionally slow down and get perspective and the ability to get in somebody else s shoes these two things he added have been invaluable to me whether they ve made me a better president i can t say but what i can say is that they have allowed me to sort of maintain my balance during the course of eight years because this is a place that comes at you hard and fast and doesn t let up read a transcript of the interview with barack obama the writings of lincoln the rev martin luther king jr gandhi and nelson mandela mr obama found were particularly helpful when what you wanted was a sense of solidarity adding during very difficult moments this job can be very isolating so sometimes you have to sort of hop across history to find folks who have been similarly feeling isolated and that s been useful there is a handwritten copy of the gettysburg address in the lincoln bedroom and sometimes in the evening mr obama says he would wander over from his home office to read it like lincoln mr obama taught himself how to write and for him too words became a way to define himself and to communicate his ideas and ideals to the world in fact there is a clear shining line connecting lincoln and king and president obama in speeches like the ones delivered in charleston and selma he has followed in their footsteps putting his mastery of language in the service of a sweeping historical vision which like theirs situates our current struggles with race and injustice in a historical continuum that traces how far we ve come and how far we have yet to go it s a vision of america as an unfinished project a continuing journey to make the promises of the declaration of independence real for everyone rooted both in scripture and the possibility of redemption and a more existential belief that we can continually remake ourselves and it s a vision shared by the civil rights movement which overcame obstacle after obstacle and persevered in the face of daunting odds mr obama s long view of history and the optimism combined with a stirring reminder of the hard work required by democracy that he articulated in his farewell speech last week are part of a faith grounded in his reading in his knowledge of history and its unexpected zigs and zags and his embrace of artists like shakespeare who saw the human situation entire its follies cruelties and mad blunders but also its resilience decencies and acts of grace the playwright s tragedies he says have been foundational for me in understanding how certain patterns repeat themselves and play themselves out between human beings presidential biographies also provided context countering the tendency to think that whatever s going on right now is uniquely disastrous or amazing or difficult he said it just serves you well to think about roosevelt trying to navigate through world war ii even books initially picked up as escape reading like the hugo apocalyptic epic the problem by the chinese writer liu cixin he said could unexpectedly put things in perspective the scope of it was immense so that was fun to read partly because my problems with congress seem fairly petty not something to worry about aliens are about to invade in his searching 1995 book dreams from my father mr obama recalls how reading was a crucial tool in sorting out what he believed dating back to his teenage years when he immersed himself in works by baldwin ellison hughes wright dubois and malcolm x in an effort to raise myself to be a black man in america later during his last two years in college he spent a focused period of deep and study methodically reading philosophers from st augustine to nietzsche emerson to sartre to niebuhr to strip down and test his own beliefs to this day reading has remained an essential part of his daily life he recently gave his daughter malia a kindle filled with books he wanted to share with her including one hundred years of solitude the golden notebook and the woman warrior and most every night in the white house he would read for an hour or so late at night reading that was deep and ecumenical ranging from contemporary literary fiction the last novel he read was colson whitehead s the underground railroad to classic novels to groundbreaking works of nonfiction like daniel kahneman s thinking fast and slow and elizabeth kolbert s the sixth extinction such books were a way for the president to shift mental gears from the briefs and policy papers he studied during the day a way to get out of my own head a way to escape the white house bubble some novels helped him to better imagine what s going on in the lives of people across the country for instance he found that marilynne robinson s novels connected him emotionally to the people he was meeting in iowa during the 2008 campaign and to his own grandparents who were from the midwest and the small town values of hard work and honesty and humility other novels served as a kind of foil something to argue with v s naipaul s novel a bend in the river mr obama recalls starts with the line the world is what it is men who are nothing who allow themselves to become nothing have no place in it and i always think about that line and i think about his novels when i m thinking about the hardness of the world sometimes particularly in foreign policy and i resist and fight against sometimes that very cynical more realistic view of the world and yet there are times where it feels as if that may be true writing was key to his thinking process too a tool for sorting through a lot of crosscurrents in my own life race class family and i genuinely believe that it was part of the way in which i was able to integrate all these pieces of myself into something relatively whole mr obama taught himself to write as a young man by keeping a journal and writing short stories when he was a community organizer in chicago working on them after he came home from work and drawing upon the stories of the people he met many of the tales were about older people and were informed by a sense of disappointment and loss there is not a lot of jack kerouac young kid on the make discovering stuff he says it s more melancholy and reflective that experience underscored the power of empathy an outsider himself with a father from kenya who left when he was 2 and a mother from kansas who took him to live for a time in indonesia he could relate to many of the people he met in the churches and streets of chicago who felt dislocated by change and isolation and he took to heart his boss s observation that the thing that brings people together to share the courage to take action on behalf of their lives is not just that they care about the same issues it s that they have shared stories this lesson would become a cornerstone of the president s vision of an america where shared concerns simple dreams of a decent job a secure future for one s children might bridge differences and divisions after all many people saw their own stories in his an american story as he said in his keynote address at the 2004 democratic national convention possible in no other country on earth in today s polarized environment where the internet has let people increasingly retreat to their own silos talking only to folks who amplify their certainties and biases the president sees novels and other art like the musical hamilton as providing a kind of bridge that might span usual divides and a reminder of the truths under the surface of what we argue about every day he points out for instance that the fiction of junot díaz and jhumpa lahiri speaks to a very particular contemporary immigration experience but at the same time tell stories about longing for this better place but also feeling displaced a theme central to much of american literature and not unlike books by philip roth and saul bellow that are steeped with this sense of being an outsider longing to get in not sure what you re giving up mr obama entered office as a writer and he will soon return to a private life as a writer planning to work on his memoirs which will draw on journals he s kept in the white house but not with the sort of discipline that i would have hoped for he has a writer s sensibility an ability to be in the moment while standing apart as an observer a novelist s eye and ear for detail and a precise but elastic voice capable of moving easily between the lyrical and the vernacular and the profound he had lunch last week with five novelists he admires dave eggers mr whitehead zadie smith mr díaz and barbara kingsolver he not only talked with them about the political and media landscape but also talked shop asking how their book tours were going and remarking that he likes to write first drafts long hand on yellow legal pads mr obama says he is hoping to eventually use his presidential center website to widen the audience for good books something he s already done with regular lists of book recommendations and then encourage a public conversation about books at a time he says when so much of our politics is trying to manage this clash of cultures brought about by globalization and technology and migration the role of stories to unify as opposed to divide to engage rather than to marginalize is more important than ever ',\n",

       " 'washington at her confirmation hearing on tuesday to be education secretary betsy devos vigorously defended her work steering taxpayer dollars from traditional public schools arguing that it was time to move away from a one size fits all system and toward newer models for students from preschool to college the hearing quickly became a heated and partisan debate that reflected the nation s political divide on how best to spend public money in education republicans applauded ms devos s work to expand charter schools and school vouchers which give families public funds to help pay tuition at private schools democrats criticized her for wanting to privatize public education and pushed her unsuccessfully to support making public colleges and universities ms devos a billionaire with a complex web of investments including in companies that stand to win or lose from federal education policy was the first nominee of donald j trump to have a senate hearing without completing an ethics review on how she planned to avoid conflicts of interest democrats pointed out that in the past republicans had insisted that no hearings be conducted before those reviews were complete senator lamar alexander republican of tennessee and chairman of the committee on health education labor and pensions limited the questioning to one round of five minutes for each senator prompting howls from democrats who noted that previous hearings had included two rounds of questions it suggests that this committee is trying to protect this nominee from scrutiny said senator christopher s murphy democrat of connecticut with time limited democrats confronted ms devos with questions demanding that she explain her family s contributions to groups that support conversion therapy for gay people her donations to republicans and their causes which she agreed totaled about 200 million over the years her past statements that government sucks and that public schools are a dead end and the poor performance of charter schools in detroit where she resisted legislation that would have blocked chronically failing charter schools from expanding under questioning ms devos said it would be premature to say whether she would continue the obama administration s policy requiring uniform reporting standards for sexual assaults on college campuses she told mr murphy whose constituents include families whose children were killed in the 2012 massacre at sandy hook elementary school that it should be left to locales to decide whether guns are allowed in schools and that she supported mr trump s call to ban zones around schools she also denied that she had personally supported conversion therapy senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts pressed ms devos on how she could oversee the education department the largest provider of student loans given that she had no experience running a large bureaucracy and that neither she nor her children had ever taken out a student loan so you have no personal experience with college financial aid ms warren asked ms devos who did not attend public schools or send her children to public schools argued that vouchers and charter schools were simply a way of offering poor parents the kind of school choice that wealthy parents have long been able to afford she described a visit she and her husband an heir to the amway fortune made to a christian school in her hometown grand rapids mich as a turning point in her career as a school choice advocate we saw the struggles and sacrifices many of these families faced when trying to choose the best educational option for their children she said for me this was not just an issue of public policy but of national injustice but democrats said research showed that voucher programs had done little to raise achievement among poor students senator patty murray of washington the ranking democrat on the committee asked ms devos can you commit to us that you will not work to privatize public schools or cut a single penny from public education ms devos began to demur saying that not all schools are working for the students that are assigned to them and that she would work to find common ground to give parents options i take that as not being willing to commit to not privatizing public education ms murray said mr alexander himself a former education secretary argued that ms devos s support of charter schools and vouchers put her in the mainstream of public opinion and that her critics were outside it he noted that charter schools which are publicly funded but typically run independently of local school districts and teachers unions have been supported by republican and democratic presidents going back to bill clinton democrats however argued that ms devos s support went well beyond charter schools to include the more contentious policy of sending public money to private and religious schools charter schools are not the issue here said senator al franken of minnesota where democrats pushed the nation s first law allowing charter schools nearly three decades ago he noted that 37 states prohibit the use of public dollars for religious schools one republican senator lisa murkowski of alaska expressed concern about ms devos s enthusiasm for school choice a moot point for many of her constituents given the vastness of her state when there is no way to get to an alternative option for your child the best parent is left relying on a public school system that they demand to be there for their kids she said asking ms devos to ensure that her commitment to traditional public education was as strong and robust as her passion for school choice ',\n",
       " 'on wednesday the senate environment and public works committee will consider donald j trump s choice of scott pruitt oklahoma s attorney general since 2011 to lead the environmental protection agency mr pruitt spent much of his time in office fighting the obama administration over the e p a s actions to regulate air and water pollution and to curb greenhouse gas emissions the committee is led by senator john barrasso republican of wyoming an outspoken contrarian on climate change and includes several republicans openly hostile to federal action to address it the democratic members of the committee include some of the senate s strongest supporters of the e p a and most forceful voices for decisive action on climate change we asked readers what questions they would ask if they could question mr pruitt more than 2 000 replied and their answers largely fell into a few categories here is what some of them would like to know many readers seemed familiar with mr pruitt s statement that the science of climate change is far from settled most pointed out that an overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that climate change is happening and is caused by human activity specifically by the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases and asked for mr pruitt s sources for his position seth rudman 28 a scientific researcher at the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia asked can you describe the shortcomings of the scientific evidence for climate change and the type of data that would be needed to convince you that climate change is happening while being a scientist is not a requirement for the job readers worried about what having a climate denialist at the top might mean for the agency during the bush administration climate scientists including dr james hansen claimed that their voices were suppressed and their reports changed to minimize the role of humans in accelerating climate change and its impact wrote donald chartier 60 the founder and chief executive of an internet company in chicago can you assure us that e p a scientists will be allowed to present scientific evidence and data freely to the american people without retaliation others focused on the risk mr pruitt was taking by denying the risks of climate change if the scientific consensus on climate change proves correct and the changes in the earth s weather cause widespread devastation loss of life and property and great economic damage who should be held responsible for staying the actions that might have prevented or ameliorated these outcomes asked joseph griffin 72 a retiree from bellefonte pa during his time as attorney general of oklahoma mr pruitt has been seen by some to be cozy with the fossil fuel industry he filed 14 suits against the e p a challenging the agency s environmental regulations looking to soften the blow of federal policies against oil gas agriculture and other interests in 13 of those cases companies that had contributed money to mr pruitt or to political campaign committees also signed on readers were concerned that mr pruitt might continue to advance the interests of industry possibly to the detriment of public health and safety how do you intend to serve the public need to protect the environment when you have demonstrated a preference for the rights of corporate shareholders asked alison ten cate 50 an energy efficiency consultant from belmont calif others wrote that mr pruitt should be asked if he would be willing to disclose the companies and lobbyists that have given money to his campaigns and agree to recuse himself from decisions involving them mr pruitt has argued that states are in a better position to regulate their environment and industries than the federal government which he has accused of overreach many readers argued that air and water do not respect state borders so it is the federal government s responsibility to regulate these interstate issues you have worked against the e p a in favor of managing interstate and global issues at the state level why asked charles haddox 59 a marketing manager in denver what success stories can you relate in detail showing states are more successful at protecting resources in the absence of federal regulation they also wondered where the limits of mr pruitt s federalism might lie does your belief in federalism mean you will not interfere with the efforts of california and other states to address climate change wrote michael mccabe 19 a student at sarah lawrence college or will you serve the interests of the fossil fuel industry and interfere with states efforts some asked practical questions like mavis 65 a teacher and naturalist in memphis who wanted to know how mr pruitt could continue to push for state and local jurisdiction of clean air and water in light of the flint mich water scandal high levels of lead were found in the city s water supply largely a result of state and local regulatory failures and the federal government had to intervene some argue too late several readers seemed puzzled at why mr pruitt would want to run a federal regulatory agency if he saw federal regulations as a problem and wondered if he had other ideas for how to regulate pollutants some also would like to hear examples of success on environmental issues from his time in office in oklahoma mark baker 48 an american who works for diageo an international beverage company in brussels asked can you provide an example of a policy that originated at the state or local level under your watch in oklahoma and that resulted in cleaner water or air for oklahoma s citizens do you believe in protecting water air and land from pollution wrote sabina gasper 55 who works for the pharmaceutical industry in bismarck n d do you believe that regulations are the way to do this if not how should these resources be protected some struck a more hopeful tone like lilian howard nearing 80 years of age a retired travel consultant and writer from virginia beach who wrote would you briefly discuss a few actions by the e p a which you believe were successful in protecting the american people and

       " 'a former contestant on the apprentice who accused donald j trump of sexual assault during the presidential race filed a lawsuit against him on tuesday alleging that mr trump defamed her when he claimed that she fabricated the assault summer zervos and her lawyer gloria allred announced the lawsuit at a news conference in los angeles days before mr trump is set to enter the white house during the campaign more than 10 women accused mr trump of inappropriate sexual contact mr trump denied every allegation when ms zervos made her claim in october saying that mr trump had kissed and groped her without her consent during encounters at his office in new york and at a hotel in los angeles mr trump said he never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately and accused ms zervos and other women of lying according to the lawsuit which was filed in new york state supreme court but it was donald trump who was lying when he falsely denied his predatory misconduct with summer zervos and derided her for perpetrating a hoax and making up a phony story to get attention the lawsuit says donald trump lied again and again and again and again in doing so he used his national and international bully pulpit to make false factual statements to denigrate and verbally attack ms zervos and the other women it went on to say that mr trump knew that his false disparaging statements would be heard and read by people around the world and that these women including summer zervos would be subjected to threats of violence economic harm and reputational damage ms allred sought to compare the lawsuit to the sexual harassment case brought by paula jones a former arkansas state employee against president bill clinton in 1994 in that civil case the united states supreme court ruled that a sitting president could be sued for actions that were said to have happened before his taking office ms allred pointed out that if the defamation case moves forward mr trump could be deposed or asked to testify and that if he were to lie under oath it would be grounds for congress to impeach him as happened with mr clinton if it got to a point where mr trump did not testify truthfully under oath in this case she said then i think congress will have a very important decision to make ms zervos kept her comments at the news conference brief saying that mr trump had left her with no choice but to take legal action and that she would press forward until he acknowledged that she told the truth hope hicks a spokeswoman for mr trump was quick to brush off the lawsuit saying in an email that there is no truth to this absurd story more of the same from gloria allred ms hicks added ms allred has been involved in a variety of cases over the years in which women have accused men of sexual harassment assault and other wrongdoing when numerous women came forward last year to accuse mr trump of sexual misconduct ms allred agreed to represent several of them organizing news conferences where they could speak out ms allred said she had not had any communication with mr trump or his lawyers about ms zervos like other accusers ms zervos said she was inspired to share her story publicly after mr trump was caught on tape bragging to the access hollywood host billy bush about sexually assaulting women and then in a presidential debate denied ever engaging in such behavior the lawsuit states that during the campaign mr trump described ms zervos s experience along with those of others as made up events that never happened 100 fabricated and charges totally false totally phoney sic stories 100 made up by women many already proven false made up stories and lies t otally made up nonsense he also threatened to sue his accusers in his effort to win the presidency and counter the damage to his election prospects caused by his own recorded words with billy bush the lawsuit says mr trump knowingly intentionally and maliciously threw each and every one of these women under the bus with conscious disregard of the impact that repeatedly calling them liars would have upon their lives and reputations the case alleges emotional harm and economic damage but ms allred said the purpose of the lawsuit was not financial the goal she said was to get mr trump to admit that he lied when he said ms zervos fabricated her allegation if mr trump made such an admission she said ms zervos would drop her case ms allred said ms zervos had already submitted to a polygraph test that would help prove she was telling the truth she also said that ms zervos has not received any outside financial support for her case when asked about the timing of lawsuit ms allred pointed out that it was being filed nearly two months after she and ms zervos had first demanded that mr trump retract his comments about her or face consequences we have given him two months she said time s up why now she said my answer would be why not now ',\n",
       " 'the american museum of natural history has long been on the front lines of the climate change discussion as its scientists study the potential damage and its educators try to alert new generations to the dangers of global warming the depth of that mission is evident in the numerous exhibitions at this manhattan museum like the film wonders of the arctic which is on view through march 2 the polar bear has always been the symbol of the arctic the narrator intones now it s become the face of climate change and the threat it poses but one of the museum s leaders a trustee who is also an important donor to the institution rebekah mercer has been using her family s millions to fund organizations that question climate change a cornerstone of the conservative agenda she is advancing as an influential member of donald j trump s transition team in recent years the mercer family foundation which ms mercer operates with her father the new york investor robert mercer has given nearly 8 million to organizations including the heartland institute in illinois a group that rejects the scientific consensus on climate change she is also on the board of the heritage foundation a conservative think tank that is skeptical of whether human behavior causes climate change the connection of ms mercer the museum and the mercer family foundation s donation history came to light during an analysis by the new york times of activities by cultural leaders who donated to mr trump s presidential campaign several of them are board members at new york city arts organizations including john paulson at the metropolitan museum of art and mercedes t bass at the metropolitan opera but none are as unusual a fit as ms mercer and the american museum of natural history on one level she is the sort of trustee museums and other nonprofit arts groups compete for a donor whose board membership could lead to more contributions museums regularly ask major donors to become trustees particularly those as generous as ms mercer whose foundation has donated at least 3 million to the museum over the past few years museum leaders generally do not vet donors and trustees for their personal or political views or apply ideological litmus tests but more often than not trustees champion the missions and philosophical underpinnings of their museums since ms mercer has only recently emerged as a player in the republican party bringing her charitable giving new public attention it s likely that the museum s trustees were unaware of her philanthropic history and specifically her generous funding of organizations on the forefront of climate change skepticism when she joined the board in 2013 about a dozen other trustees at the american museum of natural history contacted for comment declined or did not respond moreover institutions with boards as large as the museum s which numbers 49 are typically run by a core group of highly active trustees with others often being less knowledgeable about the detailed backgrounds of fellow members it is unclear what if any influence ms mercer has had at the museum beyond her financial leverage and her power as a board member ms mercer did not respond to multiple requests for comment and ellen v futter the museum s president declined to comment about ms mercer but ms futter was emphatic that it is the museum s scientists not its trustees who make decisions about the substance of what is presented at the museum the scientists at the museum are the ones who are responsible for the interpretation and presentation of scientific content she said we ve done several exhibits on climate change we ve done numerous education offerings on climate change she added and it is the scientists who make all of the decisions about science ms futter would not comment on the calls for ms mercer to step down or what brought her to the board declining to discuss the activities of a specific trustee told of ms mercer s role on the museum board several scientists and environmental organizations said that she should resign or be removed from her position because they said she was working at cross purposes with its mission there is no room for promoters of on the board of a science museum let alone arguably the greatest science museum in the world said michael e mann a leader in the climate field who directs the earth system science center at penn state he added that ms mercer has actively funded the climate change denial and disinformation campaign the climate change positions of people surrounding mr trump are being closely scrutinized as he takes office partly because the has described climate change as a hoax and vowed to cancel the paris climate accord and to undo president obama s clean power plan during the campaign ms mercer was one of mr trump s biggest donors eventually joining his transition team in which she played a significant part in pushing forward one climate change skeptic for the cabinet jeff sessions the nominee for attorney general she s certainly a force the former house speaker newt gingrich a top trump adviser said she s one of the people whose phone calls get taken environmental concerns prompted climate scientists and other groups last year to call for removal of the conservative philanthropist david h koch from the museum s board he stepped down though the museum said the reasons were unrelated to the protests ms mercer is not known for publicly speaking out on the climate change issue but her generous support of organizations that raise doubts about global warming drew criticism from environmental groups like the sierra club and greenpeace to politicize science is shameful to politicize the institutions that are designed to foster greater learning is even worse michael brune executive director of the sierra club said the museum s executives should acknowledge that they have a healthy endowment a steady stream of funding and they should thank ms mercer for her service and talk about a reasonable plan for her to resign he said jesse coleman a researcher with greenpeace called ms mercer s role on the board troubling they re an educational institution and they are trying to present the truth he said and now they have people in important positions on their board who are actively funding misinformation and they know that in addition to the heartland institute and the heritage foundation the mercer foundation has made significant donations to the cato institute and the oregon institute of science and medicine both of which also challenge aspects of climate change the oregon institute which does research on biochemistry and diagnostic medicine was by arthur b robinson a chemistry professor who unsuccessfully ran for congress in oregon and received 15 000 in campaign contributions from ms mercer in 1997 mr robinson was of an piece in the wall street journal global warming is a myth which called rising levels of carbon dioxide a boon for the environment the article was a rebuttal to the kyoto protocol which embraced the existence of global warming and set goals for worldwide emissions reductions there is not a shred of persuasive evidence that humans have been responsible for increasing global temperatures the piece said adding so we needn t worry about human use of hydrocarbons warming the earth mr robinson also directed the oregon institute s petition project which said that the global warming hypothesis is without scientific validity and that government action on the basis of this hypothesis would unnecessarily and counterproductively damage both human prosperity and the natural environment ms mercer has science bona fides having earned a master s degree in management science and engineering from stanford university where she studied biology and math as an undergraduate her father worked for ibm before joining the successful hedge fund renaissance technologies where he became a chief executive in 2010 though she briefly worked on wall street ms mercer along with her sisters jenji and heather sue their mother is diana in 2006 purchased the manhattan bakery ruby et violette which now operates online during the recent presidential campaign ms mercer started as a leading supporter of ted cruz who also argued that the threat of global warming was overstated she and her husband sylvain mirochnikoff a managing director at morgan stanley they have four children hosted a for mr cruz in 2015 at their upper west side triplex in heritage at trump place among the biggest mercer beneficiaries is the heartland institute to which their foundation has given nearly 5 million in 2011 joseph bast president and chief executive of the institute wrote that liberals accept global warming as true because stopping it requires higher taxes more income redistribution and other policies already on the liberal political agenda liberals have no reason to look under the hood of the global warming scare to see what the real science says he added they believe in global warming because they feel it justifies their ideological convictions beka economopoulos is founding director of a mobile project called the natural history museum which in 2015 drafted a letter signed by scientists calling for institutions of science and natural history to cut all ties with fossil fuel companies she said she found it troubling that ms mercer held a governing role at the museum despite her support for groups that oppose its efforts how can a science museum reconcile placing a climate denier in a leadership position she said it s incomprehensible in the era ms economopoulos added the role of our most trusted institutions of science is more important than ever ',\n",

the region is one of the largest and wealthiest economies in the world the brookings institution recently reported one reason much of america which suffered greatly during the recession resents those

       " 'donald j trump won t be sworn in until friday but big business has already thrown him a veritable inaugural ball a series of companies among them ford lockheed martin amazon and sprint have all announced plans in recent weeks to hire and invest in the united states a who s who of executives from boardrooms here and overseas have made the pilgrimage to trump tower and sought the s blessing the drumbeat of announcements on tuesday it was the turn of general motors and walmart is not just about winning good headlines or a favorable mention from the tweeter in chief however while the jobs and investments are real enough all of these corporate behemoths will soon have business before the new administration with moves expected on mergers trade policy tax reform defense contracts and regulation signaling to the and his team that they are on board now also provides chief executives with more leverage down the line it might be an attempt to buy good will but i don t blame them for trying to do that said tom c korologos a longtime republican strategist and an adviser at the law firm dla piper in washington it s a new administration and companies are nervous and don t know what to expect ultimately the new administration s decisions will be formulated far from the limelight in conference rooms at federal agencies in washington or behind closed doors on capitol hill the money riding on the outcome runs into the trillions and on issues the companies will need to make a strong case detroit automakers for example are concerned that washington will impose tariffs on cars made in mexico but they are eager for wiggle room on new standards at home walmart is worried about rising trade tensions with china where many of the products it sells are made lockheed martin whose chief executive marillyn a hewson met with mr trump on friday and promised to create 1 800 new jobs depends on the government for more than 70 percent of its 46 billion in revenue united technologies which agreed to preserve 850 jobs at its carrier unit in indianapolis after public pressure from mr trump gets about 10 percent of its sales from washington on a call with the news media on tuesday mr trump s press secretary sean spicer cited a new pledge by bayer to invest 8 billion in the united states and create 3 000 jobs the reason for this commitment and expansion is because of the s focus on creating better business climate here in the united states he said what mr spicer didn t mention is that bayer the german chemical giant faces intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in washington and europe over its plan to buy monsanto based in st louis for 57 billion if bayer cannot win approval from the justice department and the federal trade commission it will be costly with bayer obligated to pay monsanto 2 billion under the deal s terms last week the chief executives of the two companies met with trump and made their case for the merger which some advisers to mr trump have criticized mr korologos played down the idea that big business would get specific favors in exchange for hiring or investing but he acknowledged that many of the announcements were choreographed for maximum political impact there s too many hoops to jump through and too many institutions for it to be a simple quid pro quo he said but what trump is doing is very unusual and these decisions weren t made 48 hours ago or after a tweet they were in the works for a long time mr spicer did point out that bayer s decision to hire and invest more in the united states had not been disclosed previously unlike some highly promoted announcements that were essentially recycled versions of previous news releases in other cases companies are talking up hiring plans now after earlier decisions to quietly shed workers walmart the nation s largest private employer said tuesday it would create about 10 000 jobs when it opens about 60 new stores plans that had already been announced last year the additions to the work force are largely in line with walmart s typical hiring practices for new stores according to a company spokesman lorenzo lopez months before it announced the new stores last year walmart said it could lose as many as 16 000 workers by closing 154 of its american locations and 115 stores overseas mr lopez said on tuesday that a lot of the workers who had been affected by the store closures were able to move to surrounding walmart stores in the case of the auto industry mr trump s criticism of imports of vehicles has prompted companies to defend their american manufacturing presence aggressively and announce new investments some of which had long been in the planning stages last week the chief executive of fiat chrysler sergio marchionne admitted that plans for 2 000 new jobs in the united states had been under consideration long before mr trump won the presidency in november the decision has been in the works for a long time dating back to 2015 mr marchionne said during an appearance at the detroit auto show it is just a continuation of the retooling of the u s manufacturing base but mr trump s immediate and positive reaction to the announcement underscored how closely the is following the automotive job picture and how his keen interest in american manufacturing is influencing automakers on tuesday general motors the largest american automaker announced 1 billion in new investment in its american factories that would create or retain 1 500 jobs the automaker also said it was moving production of axles from mexico to the united states and creating 450 american jobs and would continue to add thousands of new technology jobs over the next few years in a statement g m said the plans had been in the works for some time yet the timing of the announcement was no coincidence given mr trump s interest there s no question there is an emphasis on job creation in the u s right now said patrick e morrissey a g m spokesman this was good timing for us to share what we are doing indeed on tuesday mr trump publicly thanked g m and walmart via twitter within hours of their announcements companies are also closely attuned to where government policy is headed and want to show they are getting with the program said bruce p mehlman founder of mehlman castagnetti rosen thomas a lobbying firm whose clients include fiat chrysler procter gamble and walmart in 2009 and 2010 under president obama it was sustainability and in 2017 with trump it s domestic manufacturing mr mehlman said for automakers that is an important issue as g m and many other companies make cars in mexico for sale in the united states the automaker has so far declined to stop importing cars from mexico but the entire auto industry is bracing for potential changes in the north american free trade agreement that could disrupt their intricate production structure in the united states canada and mexico industry analysts see the widely publicized announcements of new jobs as attempts by car companies to both blunt the s criticism and curry favor with the incoming trump administration retaining and growing jobs in the u s is a political hot

       " 'london get on with it with those words late in a major speech on tuesday prime minister theresa may charted britain s course toward a clean break with the european union and expressed her fondest hope that the time for division and discord is over her speech outlined what promised to be a hugely complex negotiation and it defined the broad objectives but not the details of british withdrawal the united kingdom is leaving the european union and my job is to get the right deal for britain as we do she said with the address mrs may began the jockeying that will lead to a break after more than four decades of tight integration and define britain s relations with its neighbors for decades to come she confirmed that britain is determined to regain control of migration from the european union and rejected the supremacy of the european court of justice that stance is anathema to the european union which has made the free movement of people as well as goods capital and services a bedrock principle and which relies on the court to arbitrate let me be clear mrs may said acknowledging the differences what i am proposing cannot mean remaining in the single market she said that she hoped to complete a final deal with the european union by march 2019 and that it would be voted on by both houses of parliament she was not clear about what would happen if parliament rejected the deal though some speculated that a rejection would result in the sort of chaotic cliff edge breakup that she and britain s bankers and business leaders hoped to avoid mrs may struck a diplomatic note including an appeal for a new partnership with continental europe but not at all costs we seek a new and equal partnership between an independent global britain and our friends and allies in the e u mrs may said not partial membership of the european union associate membership of the european union or anything that leaves us half in half out and she appealed to britons especially to those in scotland wales and northern ireland to unite behind the government and stop refighting the referendum that backed leaving the bloc which she had opposed the reaction among her opponents in the remain camp was predictably harsh and seemed to herald a long and bruising process theresa may has confirmed britain is heading for a hard brexit said tim farron the leader of the centrist liberal democrats she claimed people voted to leave the single market they didn t she has made the choice to do massive damage to the british economy the labour leader jeremy corbyn accused the tories of turning britain into a tax haven with their recent threat to slash corporate taxes if a good deal cannot be reached with the european union the speech which provided some degree of substance gained a warmer reception in the markets with the pound seeming to stabilize after several jittery days it rose as much as 1 percent against the dollar during her speech while stocks on the london exchange fell supporters of a withdrawal have been encouraged as well by reports that other countries in the bloc have recognized that they might suffer if there was a complete rupture and they were denied access to london s financial services sector but british businesses remained nervous carolyn fairbairn director general of the confederation of british industry a business lobbying group welcomed the greater clarity provided by mrs may but worried that ruling out membership of the single market has reduced options for maintaining a trading relationship between the u k and the e u kallum pickering senior britain economist at berenberg bank in london was more blunt writing in an analysis that as we do not expect the e u to compromise its principles the u k is set to face significant economic consequences from brexit few analysts expect the negotiations to go as smoothly or as quickly as mrs may seemed to say in her speech in recognition of the troubles that may lie ahead mark boleat the policy chairman for the city of london corporation the heart of britain s financial services industry urged mrs may to swiftly secure a transition deal that would provide the certainty that businesses crave charles brasted a partner at hogan lovells an international law firm cautioned that the deal mrs may wanted was likely to be seen by the european union as precisely the cherry picking that they have warned against he added the objectives are now clear the path towards them is uncharted but he warned that every one of the aspirations expressed by the u k government today will demand exceptional political skill to negotiate and will be complex to implement legally and commercially in europe donald tusk the president of the european council said on twitter sad process surrealistic times but at least more realistic announcement on brexit germany s foreign minister steinmeier welcomed mrs may s desire for a positive and constructive partnership a friendship with a strong e u which germany would reciprocate mrs may s speech delivered in the grand surroundings of lancaster house in london was the most closely watched statement on european policy since january 2013 when the prime minister at the time david cameron promised to hold a referendum on european union membership the prospect that britain would remain part of the single market has been fading since mrs may said in october that she would demand complete control of migration from the european union and release from the european court of justice the extent to which mrs may would be willing to compromise to maintain some access to the single market and to the customs union for goods was less clear membership in the customs union limits the ability of member countries to strike individual deals with nations so she said she wanted a deal that would allow britain to trade freely with the world but still have as much trade as possible with european union countries ideally britain would like to have its cake and eat it in the memorable phrase of the foreign secretary boris johnson in other words britain would reject what it disliked about the bloc like freedom of movement but keep trade unencumbered as it tried to get the best possible trading deal consistent with its other objectives while european nations are expected to be stingy with market access mr pickering says he believes they will eventually bend in the final deal he wrote he still expects britain and the european union to agree to a deal in which the u k maintains a good level of access to the e u s goods markets and limited access to the services markets crucially we expect the u k to lose its e u financial services passport mr pickering wrote referring to a system that allowed banks based in britain to offer financial services throughout the bloc this follows from the u k raising some modest barriers to migration from the e u many european union countries have backed taking a hard line against britain to send a message to other member states that might consider leaving anticipating that mrs may said that britain wanted a successful european union and a friendly partnership but that no deal for britain is better than a bad deal for britain ',\n",
       " 'sofia bulgaria with bulgaria in the grips of a bank run in the summer of 2014 lyubomir vassilev was panicking unemployed and living off a compensation package from a workplace accident he had lost access to his bank account and joined others in street protests when a troubled lender went into bankruptcy setting off a financial and political crisis months later with his parents having had to borrow money from relatives to help him survive mr vassilev finally got his 6 000 back after the bank went bankrupt he said i lost trust in the banking system mr vassilev blamed bulgaria s leaders and like many of his compatriots attributed the resolution of the crisis to the european union across much of western europe critics complain of distant and unfeeling technocrats in brussels who enforce arcane rules to the letter with little understanding of local nuances and needs britain s vote in june to leave the bloc struck a stinging blow against regional unity at a time when confidence was already flagging in the european union but mr vassilev and his fellow citizens paint a different picture one of regional officials who hold domestic authorities to account set higher standards and are more trustworthy than their local counterparts bulgaria joined the european union in 2007 along with romania at the time polling indicated that a slim majority of its population was in favor of membership hopeful that it would strengthen the balkan country s economy and political institutions in the years since bulgaria has remained the bloc s poorest member state with a per capita gross domestic product about half the regional average still incomes have risen sharply billions have been poured into infrastructure and surveys show bulgarians are still convinced that joining was a step in the right direction bulgaria has clearly benefited since it joined the european union said ruslan stefanov an analyst for the center for the study of democracy a think tank we re richer with a wider choice in terms of jobs and education across the bloc the average bulgarian now earns 440 euros or about 470 a month twice as much as when the country joined trade has increased significantly as companies have taken advantage of membership in the bloc s single market exports to european union countries have doubled in the years since bulgaria joined and sales to other member states now account for of all exports there have been other benefits tens of thousands of bulgarians are studying elsewhere in the european union a greater proportion of its population than comparably sized member states like austria the czech republic or hungary this is partly a result however of the poor quality of bulgaria s education system even more bulgarians work and travel throughout the bloc taking advantage of the region s free movement of labor that according to mr stefanov has helped keep unemployment relatively low at around 8 percent if bulgarians cannot find jobs at home he noted they look abroad the european union has also pumped in billions of euros in aid to help the country build new highways and roads develop agriculture and rural areas and protect the environment regular reports published by the european commission on corruption and organized crime persistent problems in bulgaria have kept local politicians on their toes though sofia has made little progress when it comes to uprooting graft and reforming its judiciary the fact that bulgaria is an e u member and there are a number of reforms on the way makes us believe that bulgaria is definitely on the right track said olivier marquette managing director for the bulgarian operations of aes a power company with its headquarters in arlington va aes began considering projects in bulgaria in 2000 when the country was still only a candidate to join the european union in the years since it has invested around 1 6 billion in three projects here a thermal power plant a wind farm and a waste disposal center it has not always been smooth it took two years to resolve a dispute with the utility company which owed 300 million mr marquette nevertheless says aes is happy with its bet on the country a combination of european union aid guidance and oversight has meant that within bulgaria trust in the bloc and its institutions remains strong and markedly higher than in most of the rest of the bloc about 49 percent of bulgarians say they trust the e u compared with 33 percent who do not according to a 2016 survey by eurobarometer which carries out polling in the region that is the level of trust of any member state behind lithuania and malta and around twice as much trust as bulgarians have in their own government public institutions or legal system people don t recognize the state as theirs and thus see brussels as the external power on their side said marin lessenski director of the european policies and civic participation program at the open society institute the heft of brussels came into play in 2014 in june of that year corporate commercial bank or k t b experienced mass withdrawals after a feud between a local politician and the lender s largest shareholder as confidence flagged a fifth of k t b s assets were pulled within a week and the bank was taken into central bank supervision the panic soon spread and the next month bulgaria s central bank said it would begin bankruptcy proceedings against k t b mr vassilev was one of many account holders whose lives were thrown into chaos lured by the promise of high interest rates he instead lost access to his savings for months more than two years on an investigation into k t b s collapse continues the mere existence of such a bank indicates some serious deficiencies of regulations and transparency in bulgaria said dimitar bechev the director of the european policy institute in sofia the european commission the bloc s executive arm and the european banking authority a regional financial watchdog repeatedly called on sofia to fulfill a government guarantee on depositors savings both opened investigations into whether bulgarian authorities had breached regional law by delaying payouts facing the prospect of formal charges the government finally began paying back account holders in december 2014 both inquiries have since been closed businesses also benefit from brussels s acting as a bulwark against bulgaria s politicians as well as being able to gain access to the region s single market able to export their wares without restriction to the rest of the bloc in recent years several major manufacturers of vehicle components with clients including volkswagen daimler mercedes and renault have set up shop in bulgaria the number of companies in the auto parts sector has tripled since bulgaria joined the european union now numbering around 120 businesses and last year the industry accounted for 3 5 percent of the country s economy a small community is also being built and two funds have invested more than 20 million in around 200 companies over the last four years thanks to a european initiative the businesses that have received funding include an online marketplace connecting small farms with potential customers a toymaker whose products use energy generated by children playing with them to activate lights and sounds and a company that has developed and organization software it is not just fledgling enterprises that see advantages older ones do too since we joined the e u the country has become a more stable and less risky place to do business said manol peykov who manages his family s publishing house in bulgaria s city plovdiv if it weren t for e u directives and rules bulgarian politicians would be untouchable ',\n",
       " 'davos switzerland in a world troubled by grave uncertainties over the basics governing trade security and the mission to limit climate change president xi jinping of china on tuesday portrayed his nation as a responsible global citizen dedicated to furthering international integration that a leader of the people s republic of china can stake a claim to the mantle of leadership in the realm of free trade speaks to the unforeseen even surreal alteration of the global order in recent months his message delivered here in the swiss alps at the annual gathering of the world economic forum appeared meticulously timed to the tumultuous moment at hand he was speaking three days before donald j trump was to be inaugurated president of the united states raising the prospect of a trade war with china and on the same day that prime minister theresa may of britain outlined plans to pursue her country s departure from the european union the chinese leader used his moment to make an expansive case for globalization as a source of prosperity he never mentioned mr trump by name nor did he even make reference to the fact that the white house is about to gain a new occupant yet his speech resonated as a rebuke of the trajectory that the has promised not least his repeated threat of steep tariffs on chinese goods as a response to what he portrays as predatory trade practices in myriad ways mr xi is a strikingly steward of openness and connectivity under his direction china s communist party has clamped down severely on civil society tightening restrictions on the internet and jailing scores of lawyers focused on using the country s own laws to defend the rights of aggrieved people he has projected china s navy into contested waters in the south china and east china seas throughout his speech mr xi carefully used the phrase economic globalization while avoiding unqualified globalization reflecting china s spurning of an open internet universal human rights and free elections indeed the metaphor he used to reject protectionism like locking oneself in a dark room could just as well have been used to describe china s political path under his leadership with the communist party overtly guiding a campaign to restrict the influence of what it labels western notions such as democracy this month china s top judge delivered a speech sharply criticizing the idea of an independent judiciary which he said must be resolutely rejected not for nothing china carries a reputation as a country willing to bend the norms of global commerce when such a course suits its interests steel producers around the globe complain that beijing dumps its steel on world markets at prices lower than the cost of raw materials costing jobs at mills from italy to indiana but the populist ferment refashioning the global order has made previously unthinkable roles possible in the united states the supposed citadel of free market enterprise a wealthy real estate magnate has captured the white house on the strength of his appeal as a supposed champion of workers here in davos where technology executives fret about the plight of africa while drinking champagne paid for by investment banks the chairman of the communist party of china an institution that rules in the name of revolution draped himself in the banner of globalization none of these details were featured in mr xi s highly choreographed appearance at the gathering that has become a rite of passage into the ranks of the global elite for klaus schwab executive chairman of the world economic forum the participation of china s president amounted to a public relations coup because it was the first time a chinese head of state had attended mr schwab obliged with his trademark soft treatment he asked no questions solicited none from the audience and delivered an introductory address so laudatory that it provoked winces among some in the audience in a world marked by great uncertainty and volatility the international community is looking to china to continue its responsive and responsible leadership in providing all of us with confidence and stability mr schwab said that mr xi chose this year to make his debut underscores china s attempt to improve its international standing just as much of the world appears in turmoil the united states is about to inaugurate as president someone who has questioned the relevance of powerful institutions that have anchored the world order for decades from nato to the world trade organization britain is pursuing a fraught divorce from the european union dealing a blow to those who have advanced regional integration as a solution to economic and security problems the growing electoral strength of populist union parties in france the netherlands italy and germany has intensified fears that the union may not endure these developments have yielded a gnawing sense that a complex world is suddenly short of adult supervision mr xi devoted his speech to trying to fill that vacuum casting china as a trustworthy power in which people are taking considered action to address consequential challenges from climate change to a weak global economy this appears to be a time of uncertainty in the united states in the u k said lee a prominent venture capitalist in beijing who invests in emerging chinese companies the world needs strong leaders to give the world confidence in keeping with the traditions of speeches delivered by senior chinese officials mr xi s address was long on platitudes tortured metaphors and literary references while nearly bereft of policy pronouncements yet in totality it delivered a striking message in an era in which the united states and britain are consumed with recriminations over the strains of globalization china will continue to tether its fortunes to world trade mr trump has picked as a key trade adviser the economist peter navarro who has long portrayed china as a mortal threat to american prosperity mr trump has threatened to brand the country a currency manipulator opening the door to punitive tariffs though beijing has in years past maintained its currency the renminbi at artificially low levels to make its goods cheap on world markets it has in recent months intervened aggressively in the other direction propping up its value against the dollar china has no intention to boost its trade competitiveness by devaluing the rmb mr xi said in another implicit rebuke of mr trump the chinese president argued forcefully for on the 2015 paris climate accord mr trump has threatened to renounce the deal while naming to his cabinet several people who question the basic scientific consensus on climate change the paris agreement was hard won mr xi said all signatories should stick to it instead of walking away from it as this is a responsibility we must assume for future generations mr xi was accompanied by an enormous delegation of chinese officials and business executives who reveled in a moment on the world stage posing for photos as they awaited the president s arrival in conversations on the sidelines many expressed concerns about the threats of tariffs from the incoming trump administration fearing the consequences of a potential trade war between the world s two largest economies but most assumed tough rhetoric would eventually give way to the realities of shared commercial interests china relies on access to the united states the largest consumer market on earth as the landing place for its exports the united states depends upon china for a vast range of finished goods jack ma founder and executive chairman of alibaba group the chinese giant said he assumed cooler heads would find a way to avoid trade hostilities i don t think it will happen he said of the hostilities it s going to be a disaster if it does more than a decade has passed since the united states congress effectively prevented cnooc a chinese oil company from buying the american energy company unocal branding the merger a threat to national security fu chengyu cnooc s chief executive at that time pointed to the treatment of the merger as an indication of american hypocrisy on free trade but on tuesday as he waited for the chinese president to deliver his address mr fu who recently retired from another major chinese energy company but retains a party post expressed confidence that mr xi and mr trump would forge common ground eventually they will cooperate to get more benefits mr fu said at the beginning trump will say something very harsh he will try to do something punishing but this is a sword once he s in the white house he will see things differently ',\n",

       " 'with just days to go before the inauguration of donald j trump as president once ebullient markets have eased a bit as investors have begun to ponder more seriously the risks of a trump administration after a in the weeks after mr trump s election victory stock markets in the united states have been little changed in the last month with investors on several occasions stepping back as opposed to elevating the dow jones industrial average past a 20 000 milestone the concerns include a dollar that has gained too much in value worries about trade wars with china and mexico and most broadly a fear that mr trump will not be able to deliver on his promises to cut taxes increase government spending and reduce regulation the market declines in recent weeks have been very modest and investors for now seem to be prepared to give mr trump the benefit of the doubt on his plans for the economy nevertheless in the wake of his unpredictable twitter posts last week s news conference and mr trump s tough talk about china a mood of caution has tempered earlier bouts of euphoria mr trump s comments over the weekend about the dollar being too strong about the possibility that more countries will follow britain out of the european union and his intention to tax german carmakers for not building factories in the united states all heightened these concerns people are concerned about an appreciating dollar how much higher rates will go and antagonizing china laurence d fink the chief executive of the asset management giant blackrock said in an interview last week there has been too much conversation about the glories of the u s stock market on tuesday the dollar s main index which is measured against the world s top currencies dropped by more than 1 percent even currencies like the turkish lira and the mexican peso among the world s weakest performers in the last month gained ground against the dollar economists have warned that an overly strong dollar can hurt the united states economy in several ways america s trade deficit would widen as exports stagnate and cheaper goods from mexico and china flood the market a long period of a strong dollar also increases the chances of an emerging market crisis when crucial investment funds flee currencies that are plummeting against the dollar the price of gold a traditionally safe investment was up by nearly 1 5 percent on the day the price of the treasury note rose driving its yield an important benchmark for interest rates down to 2 33 percent from the previous close 2 4 percent a sign that investors are searching for safety instead of returns by loading up on government bonds and stocks in the united states continued to search for direction in the absence of tangible developments on mr trump s plans for the economy the standard poor s index closed at 2 267 89 on tuesday down 0 3 percent the dow jones industrial average ended down by the same percentage at 19 826 77 the nasdaq composite index fell 0 63 percent to 5 538 73 mr fink s view which is shared by many investors with a global outlook is that while the has made bold promises about the need to energize what has been a tepid recovery for the nation s economy such transformations do not occur quickly these things take months and years to do mr fink said while stock market specialists are in broad agreement that the trump rally has more room to run some are beginning to question whether the marked increase in stocks has gone as far as it can without tangible policy results in the form of lower taxes and government spending initiatives i wonder if the euphoria has exceeded the fundamentals said david lafferty chief market strategist for natixis global asset management the stock market is pricing in a scenario like many he worries that such a bout of fiscal expansionism so late in the economic cycle will lead to a sharp increase in prices and a sudden move by the federal reserve to play by raising interest rates faster than the market expects economists and investment strategists are also warning of possible global shocks that could unnerve the markets in the next year while some of these upsets may be driven by the growth of populist political movements across europe in particular this higher volatility would kick in as central banks cease intervening so aggressively in markets jens nordvig a currency specialist at exante data highlighted three such concerns in a recent letter to clients he cautioned that it had been 15 years since the last emerging market crisis and pointed to turkey s plunging currency and capital outflows in china as two areas of concern he also listed a potential breakup of the european union and any move by mr trump to impose tariffs or other penalties on imports as events that could destabilize markets it is a complex world with messy answers to questions that seemed simple fairly recently mr nordvig wrote in his note and in this world significant macro shocks will be more prevalent ',\n",
       " 'oakland calif she fired none of the shots she was nowhere near the bloody scene and none of the evidence made public so far hints that she shared her husband s violent jihadist ideology yet noor zahi salman the widow of the gunman who massacred revelers at an orlando nightclub stood before a federal judge on tuesday as the only person charged in the attack in the early hours of june 12 ms salman s husband omar mateen killed 49 people at pulse a gay nightclub and wounded 53 others in one of the worst terrorist attacks on american soil before being fatally shot by the police mr mateen a security guard declared his allegiance to the islamic state though suspicion and scrutiny naturally fall on people close to someone who commits terrorism or mass murder it is rare for a wife or a girlfriend to end up facing charges but in a brief hearing in federal court in oakland a federal prosecutor roger handberg explained why the authorities considered ms salman an exception she knew he was going to conduct the attack mr handberg said an indictment unsealed on tuesday accused ms salman 30 of aiding and abetting the attempted provision and provision of material support to a foreign terrorist organization a charge that can carry a sentence of life in prison she was also charged with obstruction of justice for allegedly misleading police officers and federal agents who interviewed her for 12 hours on the day of the shooting ms salman went with her husband to buy ammunition drove him to orlando when he apparently scouted his target and knew that he watched jihadist propaganda videos those could be innocent acts or indications of criminal culpability depending on her own intent and what she knew of his her fate could turn on evidence about her frame of mind including how much she was controlled by her husband who she has said abused her we ve seen the government trying to widen the definition of material support and the increased visibility of women being involved in jihadist movements makes it easier to imagine charging them with terrorism said nimmi gowrinathan a visiting professor at the city college of new york who studies women in violent situations around the world in an interview last fall with the new york times her only public statement since the attack ms salman said she had not known what her husband planned to do a claim that her uncle al salman made repeatedly outside the courthouse on tuesday prosecutors who plan to pursue the case in a federal court in florida gave little new information leaving unclear what evidence they had or why seven months had passed before charges were filed ms salman who was arrested on monday and has a young son fathered by mr mateen has been living with relatives in rodeo calif northeast of san francisco visibly shaking in a and gray jail uniform ms salman stood in court tuesday and in a barely audible voice told magistrate judge donna m ryu who had to ask her to speak up that she understood the charges against her only when she was led from the courtroom did she raise her head and let her eyes search the packed gallery on wednesday the judge will consider whether to grant bail the married couple who fatally shot 14 people in san bernardino calif in 2015 provide the clearest case of a wife as accomplice but examples remain rare a study of more than 100 terrorists in western countries who acted alone or in pairs found that most of them were single percent confided in someone about their plans the authors found but research showed that only 4 percent told a spouse a girlfriend or a boyfriend the closest parallel to ms salman may be katherine russell the widow of one of the boston marathon bombers tamerlan tsarnaev and the mother of his child the bombs detonated at the race in 2013 were made in the home she and her husband shared and testimony at the trial of the surviving bomber ms russell s dzhokhar tsarnaev indicated that her computer had been used for a search on the rewards that come to the widow of a martyr for islam ms russell talked to investigators but refused to testify before a grand jury without immunity from prosecution federal agents investigating the case were eager to bring charges against her but prosecutors decided not to ms salman and mr mateen s former wife sitora yusufiy have both said that he beat them severely and tried to control every aspect of their lives citing that abuse a lawyer for ms salman linda moreno said recently that it was misguided and wrong to prosecute her experts say that domestic violence is a common trait among mass killers and terrorists and that close relatives are often among their victims tamerlan tsarnaev was also accused of domestic violence by a previous girlfriend misogyny and extremism work together very often so abuse is entrenched in these cases dr gowrinathan the city college professor said but she added sympathy for women as victims of abuse tends to evaporate in terrorism cases at the time of the pulse shooting ms salman was at home in fort pierce fla a drive from orlando but the indictment charged that she had been abetting her husband s plans since at least late april prosecutors say she knowingly misled the f b i agents and fort pierce police officers who interviewed her the indictment also says the government wants her to forfeit more than 30 000 which may be connected to the jewelry she has said her husband lavished on her in the final days of his life in interviews last year friends and acquaintances described ms salman as a relatively naïve young woman a doting mother who could have unwittingly witnessed the buildup to her husband s attack the daughter of palestinian immigrants she struggled in high school they said but earned an associate degree at a community college before meeting mr mateen a son of afghan immigrants on an arab dating website i was unaware of everything ms salman said in the times interview last year i don t condone what he has done i am very sorry for what has happened he has hurt a lot of people she said that she had known her husband was viewing jihadist videos but that she had disapproved and forced him to turn them off so that their son would not see them she said that the drive to orlando had seemed innocent and that the ammunition purchase was unremarkable for a security guard who practiced at a shooting range the f b i

       " 'hong kong almost three years after malaysia airlines flight 370 disappeared with 239 people on board officials said on tuesday that they had called off the underwater search for the plane ensuring that one of the great aviation mysteries will remain unsolved for the foreseeable future the decision which had been expected indefinitely suspends an intensive search in the southern indian ocean for remnants of the plane a boeing 777 the underwater search turned up no traces of the aircraft although pieces of debris were found as far away as tanzania flight 370 disappeared on the way from kuala lumpur the malaysian capital to beijing on march 8 2014 prompting the largest and costliest search in aviation history investigators determined that the plane veered off course and flew south for several hours for reasons that remain unknown today the last search vessel has left the underwater search area the governments of australia china and malaysia the three countries that oversaw the search said in a joint statement on tuesday malaysia airlines flight 370 has not been located in the underwater search area in the southern indian ocean a zone of more than 46 000 square miles despite every effort using the best science available technology as well as modeling and advice from highly skilled professionals who are the best in their field unfortunately the search has not been able to locate the aircraft the statement said accordingly the underwater search for mh370 has been suspended at a news conference in sydney on wednesday australia s prime minister malcolm turnbull said we grieve with the families of the victims and we share their deep disappointment that the plane has not been found there has been a massive search it is an unprecedented search mr turnbull added it has been conducted with the best advice over the areas that were identified as the most likely to find the location of the airplane the decision drew sharp rebukes from relatives of the missing it is incomprehensible that they would give up right now a sobbing grace nathan 28 whose mother anne daisy was on the flight said in a telephone interview from kuala lumpur i can t imagine living the rest of my life accepting that people just disappeared into thin air investigators have several theories about what happened they believe that the plane ran out of fuel and one theory holds that the pilots tried to make an emergency landing at sea it has also been suggested that one or both pilots lost control of the aircraft that one was a rogue pilot or that the plane was hijacked what investigators do know from radar and satellite communications data is that the plane made several turns then flew south for five hours that information led them to concentrate the search along a arc from which the plane most likely sent its last signal the first phase of the search lasting 52 days was conducted from the air covering 1 7 million square miles and involving 334 search flights australia china and malaysia have said since july that the search would end if the plane were not found china is involved because 153 of the passengers on the plane were chinese in december investigators said they may have been looking too far south and recommended expanding the search zone but the australian government said that without more credible evidence on a specific location the search which cost a total of 150 million would be called off this month we remain hopeful that new information will come to light and that at some point in the future the aircraft will be located the statement on tuesday said about 20 pieces of debris believed to be from the missing jet have been recovered including a wing part known as a flaperon that was found on réunion island east of madagascar in july 2015 that location combined with analysis of ocean currents supported the theory that the plane had crashed in the southern indian ocean the end of the search appeared to dash the last hopes of victims relatives there have been so many similar incidents and people were always able to find something said liu jiani whose grandparents chinese citizens were on the plane why has nothing been found ',\n",
       " 'the new york times has deftly adapted to the demands of digital journalism but it needs to change even more quickly according to an internal report that recommends the company expand training for reporters and editors hire journalists with more varied skills and deepen engagement with readers as a way to build loyalty and attract the subscriptions necessary to survive the report released to the times newsroom on tuesday culminates a year of work by a group of seven journalists who were asked by dean baquet the executive editor to conduct a review of the newsroom and determine a blueprint for its path forward titled journalism that stands apart and known internally as the 2020 report the document provides a set of broad principles to accelerate the transformation while maintaining a commitment to journalism the report comes at a particularly sobering time for the legacy media industry the steep and continuous decline of print advertising has led to significant financial challenges for most newspapers which in turn are cutting costs and trying to find new revenue sources news organizations including the wall street journal and gannett have made significant cuts in staffing the journal is currently conducting a newsroom review similar to that of the times called wsj2020 among the other recommendations in the times s report were reducing duplicative layers of article editing and having visual experts play the primary role covering some stories part of an urgent call for more visual journalism the report also calls for a renewed focus on diversity within the times as a way of ensuring that the paper s journalists reflect the audience we seek the world is changing really rapidly david leonhardt a columnist who led the group s work said in an interview we have to keep up and even get ahead of it in a note to the newsroom mr baquet and joseph kahn the times s managing editor endorsed the group s recommendations saying they outlined an opportunity we have to produce an even more vital more authoritative more indispensable news report the 2020 group acknowledged budget realities that would affect newsroom turnover but it did not identify specific areas to be cut mr baquet and mr kahn however went beyond the report and more bluntly addressed the need for staff cuts saying that moving away from duplicative and often line editing would lead to reductions in the editor ranks let s not be coy they wrote the changes will lead to fewer editors at the times in an interview on tuesday mr baquet acknowledged that the times had long valued its meticulous editing and reducing its editor ranks represented a significant cultural transformation but he said i do not believe that eliminating some of that editing will make us a lesser institution the plan to cut back on editors reflects a broader effort by legacy publications to streamline their operations and align themselves with leaner digital media companies which built their newsrooms without the kind of multilayered editing process inherent in print production if you look at any newsroom that was built for a digital environment they don t have anything like the editing structure that the times has said joshua benton the director of the nieman journalism lab on the one hand that is something that the times is differentiated through but on the other hand if you do need to become more efficient then some reduction there does make sense mr baquet and mr kahn said in their note that the shift to digital publishing demanded a smaller and more focused newsroom but added that the reconfiguration should be viewed as a necessary repositioning of the times s newsroom not as a diminishment an announcement about downsizing in the newsroom will come in the first half of the year mr baquet said their note also laid out some concrete steps for various projects including a plan to invest 5 million toward covering the incoming president donald j trump and his administration the report coincides with a series of broader changes at the times including a reimagining of the print newspaper an aggressive international expansion a heightened emphasis on graphics podcasts video and virtual reality the purchase of the product recommendation site the wirecutter and its sibling the sweethome and changes in top newsroom management the times also recently appointed a g sulzberger as deputy publisher positioning him to succeed his father arthur sulzberger jr as publisher many of the initiatives are intended to support an ambitious goal that the times laid out in october 2015 to double its digital revenue to 800 million in 2020 compared with 400 million in 2014 last year the report says the times generated nearly 500 million in purely digital revenue the times and other news organizations are also bracing for the challenges of covering an administration that is openly hostile to the news media while trying to forge a stronger connection to the large bloc of voters who swept mr trump to the presidency at the times the election threw the newsroom into a period of as it grappled with criticism that it had missed the signs pointing to mr trump s victory in the days after the election mr baquet and the elder mr sulzberger sent notes to the newsroom and readers reassuring them that the times remained committed to holding powerful people and institutions accountable mr baquet initially planned to release the report in november but it was pushed back after the unexpected election results which demanded the organization s full attention within the times s newsroom where the impending staff cuts have some employees on edge the report did not satisfy those looking for specific guidance on their future several employees said much of the report merely confirmed many of the initiatives that were already underway some expressed frustration that the report did not provide details about layoffs and that there was little information about how individual departments might be altered or how specific jobs might change instead the report emphasizes the times s strengths and lays out a series of broad recommendations intended to ensure the company s survival for years to come mr baquet said the goal was to put in place as many recommendations as possible this year several of them have been introduced including the creation of newsroom teams and a restructuring of the copy desks most important the report affirms the times s commitment to its revenue model a departure from many other publications both traditional and online whose businesses are built on visitors and clicks we are in the simplest terms a business the report says we are not trying to maximize clicks and sell advertising against them we are not trying to win a arms race among the report s recommendations is that the times improve and expand its training efforts and accelerate hiring to shift the balance away from roles the goal is to reconfigure the news report so that it aligns with the range of digital offerings audiences now expect it s the single biggest message the committee delivered mr leonhardt said the 2020 committee also recommends that the times continue to reduce the role the print newspaper plays in determining the daily rhythms of its journalism while maintaining it as a valuable attraction to readers our future is much more digital than print mr leonhardt said and so the question then becomes how do you accomplish both of these at once ',\n",

pork and sweet potato stew and turned to a local television reporter how does it feel the reporter asked to know that she had saved her hometown if i had saved kinston she replied we wouldn t need a food bank and all these people wouldn t be waiting for lunch ms howard 38 has been called many things her mother calls her the life of the party her father calls her big time a nickname from her childhood a few of the 80 people she employs call her a control freak but hometown hero may be the label that makes her most uncomfortable saving a town was not what i was trying to do she said i m just a storyteller a storyteller who cooks still ms howard the girl who spent her childhood plotting an escape from this rural eastern north carolina county has become an unlikely engine in its economic and cultural revival twelve years ago when her family talked her into coming home to open a restaurant she thought that somehow she had failed now ms howard is five seasons into a chef s life her popular public television show her restaurant chef the farmer attracts talent from the best professional kitchens in the south traveling food celebrities drop by to learn about the region new restaurants galleries and a brewery have come to town the lady who taught her how to make biscuits can charge tourists 100 for a private lesson at first glance the show seems an unlikely hit a about running a restaurant managing a family and how best to cook regional specialties like cabbage collards or flounder caught from the nearby atlantic or seasoning meat coaxed from the jowls and tails of pigs guests include the guy at the fish store the neighbors who make collard kraut and the farmer who sells the restaurant its vegetables but to many of the show s three million fans and to the guests who travel hundreds of miles to eat at her restaurant ms howard is a rural princess leia in the wake of an election that laid bare the nation s political cultural and economic divisions her life has a particular resonance with the kind of people who see her story as theirs what i came to realize was that much of rural america feels forgotten and misunderstood and frankly hopeless ms howard said urban folks are afraid of rural folks and rural folks are afraid of urban folks on our show we try to bridge the gap she and her team paid for the first season which aired in 2013 with a crowdsourcing campaign and a little money from organizations like the north carolina pork council blue cross blue shield and a group of civic leaders the show was something of a hail mary pass for a region trying to find something to replace tobacco production and factory work i like to call it more like waiting for guffman said ben knight 40 ms howard s husband and the restaurant s manager who enjoys his own celebrity status among fans the show caught on winning a peabody award and a daytime emmy sponsorship is so robust that they can afford to pay some of the local residents who appear as guests on about any weekend night most of the 220 diners who land a seat at her restaurant will be from somewhere else her parents john and scarlett are regulars after they eat they ll take a spin through the parking to count the license plates it s the darn craziest thing i have ever seen john howard said people will drive 300 miles for a meal as one of the state s largest commodity hog producers he also can t believe the price his daughter pays for local pork on a recent night sarah reichard 35 arrived for dinner with her husband mitch macdougall 34 the vacationing maryland couple had brought a copy of ms howard s new book deep run roots neatly annotated with sticky notes marking their favorite recipes at 564 pages the book is both an important catalog of the unique cooking style of coastal north carolina and a record of the emotional journey of a young woman who grew up feeling disenfranchised and ashamed of her people ms reichard who was raised in a small pennsylvania town trembled as she spoke with ms howard she talks about things i feel all the time she said i hate where i m from too from as early as she can remember ms howard had wanted to get out of deep run the slip of a community near kinston where she was born she was in boarding school by 14 then headed to north carolina state where she dreamed of becoming a journalist she moved to new york burned out at an advertising agency and stumbled into a waitressing job at voyage a globally influenced restaurant in the west village there she fell in love with a mr knight 40 an artist who paints large abstract works with glossy acrylics she attended the institute of culinary education interned at wylie dufresne s and cooked on the line at vongerichten s spice market the couple were selling soup from their harlem apartment when her asked them to come home to kinston and open a restaurant in the building he had bought in the faded downtown district they moved in 2005 happy to be out of new york living and in a little house on the river that her father calls his nap shack and finding their way in the community still the economic reality was grim hurricane floyd had ravaged the region six years earlier the tobacco warehouses and shirt factories had long been shut down and the dupont polyester plant was a shadow of its former self everyone here had an excuse for why they hadn t left yet ms howard said i was like i should be ashamed of this place too in what seemed to many a foolish move they opened chef the farmer at first they served fancy city food she remembers the day her sister pointed out that three of the four desserts had vegetables in them and that didn t mean carrot cake i was cooking down to people ms howard said i didn t feel like these people had anything to teach me she decided to embrace the local dishes she had grown up eating she could elevate the wild muscadine grapes the butter beans and the tom thumbs pork sausages whose casings are made from pig appendixes in the process she elevated herself she came to consider the people in her town as guides to a stronger simpler way of living buoyed by the increased interest in southern cooking and a few good mentions in the regional press she persuaded the documentary filmmaker cynthia hill to make a tv show ms hill had grown up seven miles away from ms howard and she understood the desire to leave a place and then come home again initially i think she was just trying to save herself ms hill said in the process she is saving a lot of people the show has started a sort of renaissance in the town where a local investor has opened a boutique hotel and the mother earth brewing company and taproom storefronts are being refurbished the couple has opened an oyster bar and burger joint called the boiler room across the alley and are planning a bakery i don t think she realized this was all going to happen but right now she s the hometown girl that made good and came back which gives her some cachet said bill smith a chef and southern food authority who grew up in the area mr smith appeared on a recent holiday special helping ms howard and her neighbors kill a pig and make corned ham from it not everyone however is entirely enamored of the food grayson haver currin until recently a longtime editor at indy week an alternative paper published in the hill triangle thinks chefs like sean brock in charleston s c and ashley christensen in raleigh do a better job interpreting the traditional southern culinary canon for modern eaters that said in kinston it s kind of that food like that exists mr currin said the story of that family and what they ve accomplished in postindustrial america is fascinating but it s a slow process and it s a limited process no matter how many restaurants you put in that town you can t change the economics and racial realities the average annual income in lenoir county which has about 58 000 people is 20 191 in kinston the county s most populous community almost 70 percent of the residents are black while most of its elected leadership is white at the fish store and the piggly wiggly black customers didn t seem to know about ms howard s show or her restaurant the managers who were white did the region s troubles only got worse in october when floodwaters brought on by hurricane matthew devastated the community four died bridges were washed away and roads were closed for weeks four of the six hotels in the town flooded and more than 3 200 people applied for help from the federal emergency management agency ms howard was on her book tour when the hurricane hit kinston her marketing plan was to tour 24 cities in a food truck for 50 people got a book and a simple supper like a bowl of eastern north carolina fish stew and eggs built from chunks of fish layered with potatoes and onions and flavored with onions tomato paste and chile flakes all but one event sold out fans lined up to tell ms howard about their mothers who like hers suffer from rheumatoid arthritis ms howard s young twins are sometimes on the show which led to a parade of parents eager to discuss their own twins chelsie and jono brymer a young couple from trenton mich drove to chicago just to see her they too had moved back home to a struggling former steel town to open a little french cafe called promenade artisan foods we watched the show and realized we were not the only ones who ask ourselves if we were crazy to do it ms brymer said by the time she returned home ms howard was exhausted from the road she had organized a statewide fish stew for flood victims that raised more than 30 000 she had shaken hands with so many strangers that she felt like a politician she had seen her twins florence and theodore maybe four times during the tour ms howard vowed to stay home more tending both to the children and to the restaurant in a more balanced way there would be no more with her face on them and less energy spent on expanding her line of sauces and rubs and ms howard is changing the show now shooting its fifth season it will still be set in eastern north carolina but it will shift the focus to the people in her life who cook food from other cultures there s only one of me she said and i have to decide what i want to do recipe eastern north carolina fish stew',\n",
       " 'paris he has nailed his scrotum to the cobblestones of red square sewn his lips shut to protest restrictions and set fire to the doors of russia s federal security service now pyotr pavlensky russia s performance artist has fled to france where he intends to seek political asylum russian authorities questioned mr pavlensky and his partner oksana shalygina last month after an actress at an moscow theater filed a complaint accusing them of sexual assault the couple deny the allegations saying that the encounter was a consensual threesome and that the case is politically motivated amid the ambiguities and at a time when violence against women is a topic of intense debate in the country russia s cultural opposition is now divided over a figure once seen as a symbol of the resistance to president vladimir v putin s russia mr pavlensky and ms shalygina have not been formally charged but were questioned by the police in moscow on dec 15 and informed that they could face up to 10 years in prison told not to leave moscow while the case was pending they said they saw what was likely to happen and took their daughters ages 6 and 8 to france over the weekend after spending a month in ukraine we ve become victims of this investigation mr pavlensky said in an interview on monday in a paris cafe speaking russian through an interpreter and with ms shalygina at his side it s like a horrible dream that you can t even imagine the situation with its charges of a honey trap and kompromat compromising material gathered by the authorities reflects the climate of suspicion and growing authoritarianism in russia where artists like the female punk band pussy riot have faced jail but for the most part outright censorship has given way to artistic in the face of changing laws and cuts to culture funding the accusations however have prompted even some supporters of mr pavlensky to question his behavior the theater where the actress works teatr doc is known for plays that have criticized and angered the russian government and it has supported mr pavlensky in the past but its leadership has seconded the assault accusations and defended the actress against the couple s assertions that she was working for the state this is not the first time mr pavlensky has found himself in the cross hairs of the russian authorities over the years they have ordered him to undergo a dozen psychiatric evaluations a technique long used to quash political dissent in 2014 he chopped off his right earlobe for a piece called segregation inspired by van gogh and intended he said to show that psychiatry is a collection of subjective opinions after setting fire to the doors of lubyanka the moscow headquarters of russia s infamous security service in 2015 he served seven months in pretrial detention on charges of vandalism he called that action threat and said it was intended to illuminate what people prefer to forget that the security apparatus hadn t changed since soviet times he was released last june with a fine a move human rights activists said was intended to avoid an international incident of the kind that ensued after members of pussy riot were jailed in 2012 on charges of hooliganism for performing an song in a moscow church soon after mr pavlensky said he gave some lectures at teatr doc it was at one of them last september that he met the actress who later filed the assault complaint mr pavlensky said that on dec 4 the actress texted ms shalygina the couple who say they have an open relationship invited her to their moscow apartment that evening we talked about art he said we sat and drank coffee we drank cognac but not a lot there was some form of intimacy he added and then she said she wants to leave we said fine no problem we parted as friends both mr pavlensky 32 and ms shalygina 37 said it was the first time the three had had sex together yuri a lysenko a lawyer for the actress said that mr pavlensky had committed a crime a rape and that he wanted to portray the police investigation as politically motivated to avoid punishment adding to the confusion over the allegations this week teatr doc posted on its facebook page a video dated oct 31 that it said showed mr pavlensky and others beating up a man they said was the actress s boyfriend in the theater s parking lot mr pavlensky said that the video was murky and that he didn t recognize himself in it but he said he had been involved in a physical altercation with the actress s boyfriend in october when he and others confronted the man over allegations that he had beaten her the interfax news agency reported that the police told him that a criminal case had been opened about the fight mr pavlensky said that was not the case mr lysenko said the fight with the boyfriend and the sexual assault allegations were not related he then added you have to ask mr pavlensky if he has seen a psychiatrist recently what he did is part of his carefully crafted plan to paint his crime in political colors in a facebook post that she said would be her last word on the matter yelena gremina the director of teatr doc called the couple s claims that the actress worked for the security services slander on russia s vibrant social media artists are divided over the case the hysteria with pavlensky is an alarming sign that anyone who becomes a significant fighter against the regime is immediately put on a pedestal and declared a saint the artist lena hades wrote on facebook others came out against mr pavlensky alas yesterday a national hero and a great performance artist today it s true a criminal a psychopath and a rapist olga papernaya a former art director at a moscow film club wrote on facebook suggesting that she was friends with the actress for now the authorities are winning mr pavlensky said the press is weak he added and the opposition divided even over russia s annexation of crimea but each move is not the last he said of the country s situation it s not clear who will have the last word in this conflict ',\n",
       " 'to be a woman in the united states is to feel unequal despite great strides in gender equality according to a poll about gender in postelection america released tuesday it s catcalls on the street disrespect at work and unbalanced responsibilities at home for girls it s being taught more than boys to aspire to marriage and for women it s watching positions of power go to men men however don t necessarily see it that way those are some of the findings from the poll by perryundem a nonpartisan research and polling firm whose biggest clients are foundations it surveyed 1 302 adults in december via the national opinion research center at the university of chicago s amerispeak panel percent of women said sexism was a problem in society today and 41 percent of women said they had felt unequal because of their gender men underestimated the sexism felt by the women in their lives the survey found and while most respondents agreed it s a better time to be a man than a woman in our society only republican men thought it was a better time to be a woman than a man as women across the nation prepare to march in protest of an election in which gender loomed large the poll results reveal nearly unanimous support for gender equality and policies that would help women but deep partisan divides in the perception of inequality and of who s thriving and who s losing in society many americans seemed to think others had it better than they did especially republican men over all only 37 percent of respondents thought it was a good time to be a woman in the united states fewer thought it was a good time to be a minority woman 24 percent said it was a good time to be a latina and 11 percent a muslim woman republican men seem to see it differently just over half thought it was a good time to be a woman while only 41 percent of them thought it was a good time to be a man donald j trump s rhetoric has appealed to people who feel this way at his victory rally in cincinnati last month he said about women i hate to tell you men generally speaking they re better than you are now if i said it the other way around i d be in big trouble dennis halaszynski 81 is a retired police captain in mckeesport pa and a registered democrat who voted for mr trump it s easier being a woman today than it is a man he said in an interview the white man is a low person on the totem pole everybody else is above the white man women should be highly respected he said but they are no longer unequal everything in general is in favor of a woman no matter what happens in life it seems like the man s always at fault democrats of both genders were much more likely to have felt unequal because of some aspect of their identity 68 percent compared with 47 percent of republicans gender race and religious views were the biggest reasons the only reasons republicans were more likely than democrats to feel unequal were their religious views and military status there is overwhelming support for gender equality in work life and politics 93 percent of respondents said they believed in it but 43 percent of male trump voters said it had already been achieved only 20 percent of those polled and 12 percent of women agreed the disparity is partly because people define equality very differently based on their politics and gender a majority of respondents said the following things affected women s rights and equality unequal responsibilities caring for children violence against women a focus on women s beauty and sexuality the lack of women in political office and positions of power sexism racism equal opportunities in the workplace and access to birth control and abortion but in almost every instance republican men had a different view for example 51 percent of respondents but 24 percent of republican men said a lack of women in political office affected women s rights percent of respondents over all and 36 percent of republican men said unequal responsibilities caring for family affected women s rights even men who said women were still treated unequally underestimated the sexism that women experience while 41 percent of women said they frequently or sometimes heard sexist language in their daily lives 26 percent of men thought their partners did percent of women said they had been touched by a man in an inappropriate way without consent while 31 percent of men thought their partners had the typical catcalling or comments or inappropriate gestures that men make toward you i don t think there s any women who haven t experienced that sort of harassment said cristina hall 44 who works in customer service in san diego but she was not surprised that men didn t realize it i think when people don t go through certain experiences it s hard for them to understand that it even happens ms hall said maybe they ve never done it to a woman plus as women we don t typically say anything because of fear we re not going to be believed or retaliation or shame about 40 percent of women said acts of sexism would be more likely because mr trump won including sexual assault and feelings of entitlement among men to treat women as sexual objects about a third of respondents said they were less tolerant of sexism in their own lives as a result of mr trump s victory and 43 percent of parents said it made them teach their children about sexual assault and consent people seem to feel validated in their racist and sexist beliefs right now said tayler lien 22 a college student in las vegas who voted for hillary clinton it s a little bit scary there was widespread support among large majorities in both parties for policies that would help women like equal pay and paid leave these have been rallying cries for feminists and progressives and republicans have traditionally opposed them congress failed to act on those policies during the obama administration but mr trump has said he would push for them ninety percent of the respondents and 86 percent of republicans supported the idea that the next president and congress should work on equal pay laws percent of respondents supported policies improving access to affordable child care and 87 percent supported paid family and medical leave policies concerning reproductive rights were the exception to the bipartisan support percent of republicans and 82 percent of democrats said they supported work toward protecting a woman s right to abortion from the next president and congress and 40 percent of republicans and 80 percent of democrats opposed getting rid of the part of obamacare that offers birth control without a peg cherry 83 a lifelong republican who voted for mr trump said only jobs were available when she was young she worked in retail and elder care jobs while raising five daughters all five worked a feather in my cap she said and so she supports policies like equal pay and paid leave she thinks mr trump will deliver i think he s going to put his money where his mouth is said ms cherry who lives in lisbon falls me i think he s more likely to because look he s had his daughter in charge of a company and he could very well put a man in there ms cherry is not the only one pinning her hopes on ivanka trump for policies percent of people including the majority of democrats said they wanted her to help push forward on women s rights and equality despite the widespread support for gender equality and certain feminist policies only 19 percent of respondents said they considered themselves feminists there was no clear consensus on who best represented feminism today

       " ' france two years ago elisabeth lavarde decided to quit her office job in paris and start a new life in a small town with two butchers and one baker just south of the capital ms lavarde 39 is now an apprentice farmer at a farm that grows organic vegetables sold directly to local consumers new farmers like ms lavarde usually make what they see as a decent salary of about 1 500 euros or about 1 600 a month slightly above the french minimum wage i wanted a job with more meaning she said i felt like i was tilting at windmills alongside the experienced farmer she has been paired with as part of a training program set up by an association that nurtures farmers ms lavarde grows around 40 kinds of organic produce including tomatoes potatoes cauliflowers and carrots as the sun was about to set behind rows of cauliflower plants on a recent afternoon ms lavarde gazed over the land she cultivates a few yards away a large shelter of tarpaulins rippled in the wind ms lavarde and her farming tutor guilain vergé 31 use the shelter to do their bookkeeping and to keep track of their crops on a whiteboard as they wait for authorization from the local government to build a decent barn it s all hard work she acknowledges but she says seeing the sky every day be it blue or gray it s amazing more younger people like ms lavarde are making lives as farmers in france drawn in some cases by idealistic notions of tilling the land and of getting away from the rat race of the cities they often leave behind jobs as well as relatively comfortable lives that they nonetheless find unfulfilling powering this farming drive is a thriving market for organic food that amounted to nearly 7 billion in france in 2016 according to agence bio which tracks the trade in the country the drive has also been bolstered by an increased awareness of the environmental and health benefits of consuming local products before they can set up shop however new entrants have to overcome a range of obstacles including navigating their way through a labyrinthine bureaucracy that oversees building permits and the distribution of land the duke of sully a minister of king henri iv of france in the early 17th century once described plow and pasture as the lifeblood of the french economy and farming has long been romanticized in a country that values gastronomic treasures like camembert cheeses and bordeaux wines but the reality is much bleaker for most farmers who say they feel constrained by european union regulations and who have been hit by global competition shrinking margins and poor harvests in recent years generous agricultural subsidies mostly benefit large farms in france a farmer commits suicide almost every other day a rate 20 percent higher than the national average according to a 2016 report by the national public health agency that dire outlook however has not deterred people like ms lavarde from taking up farming even if established farmers view their efforts with skepticism standing near a frozen wheat field near ms lavarde s farm bruno gilles 47 a farmer who grows cauliflowers tomatoes and other vegetables was skeptical about ms lavarde s chances of success citing narrow margins and competition from farms that produce vegetables it s going to be very hard mr gilles said his arms folded over a military sweater the first test for new entrants might be their hardest finding land i find myself to be extremely lucky ms lavarde said when i see other people around me access to land truly has been an obstacle for them since the 1960s that access has been tightly regulated through regional agencies that act as intermediaries between and those either selling or renting the agencies have traditionally favored established farmers over new entrants many of whom grow alternative products based on organic farming and have modest farming experience ms lavarde said that when a young farmer she worked with set out to find agrarian land in the area of she discovered that a tract had been allocated to a conventional farmer without anyone informing her that it was available ms lavarde found a plot to farm through les champs des possibles which translates roughly as realm of the possible a nonprofit that pairs new farmers with experienced farmers on test farms for two or three years we provide them with land if needed with a status with means of production with professional support said cavalier an agronomist at reneta a national network of 70 testing grounds of which les champs des possibles is a member at the end of their training period aspiring farmers have agrarian experience some money in the bank and mentors to vouch for them when they fill out papers to apply for land part of the problem with land allocations is the lack of farms on the market said françois purseigle a sociologist at an agronomy engineering faculty in toulouse in southern france we have guys in the fields that think i m keeping my farm my children are teachers or doctors so they re not going to take over i have a crummy pension i ll still keep that property because you never know it could gain in value mr purseigle said in a telephone interview vincent martin shielded his eyes from the sun on a recent morning at a farm near the village of st about a drive east of he said much of his future as a farmer relied on finding agrarian land land is key said mr martin 36 a single farmer who made a living selling health club memberships in paris until he left his job about five years ago eventually to take up farming to find agricultural land in the area he was counting on word of mouth rather than on the regional agencies despite having filled out piles of application forms his tutor philippe caron 58 who took up farming a few years ago said he and his wife anna would do all they could to help mr martin get started the other challenge facing new producers is distribution which for larger established farms usually involves dealing with middlemen selling products to supermarkets and stores around the country for small producers the system cuts deeply into meager profits the solution has been to find ways of selling directly to consumers mostly through nationwide networks like the association for the defense of agriculture known by its french acronym amap under one amap plan consumers sign up for a year and get a basket of vegetables meat cheese or fruits each week delivered by a local producer prices for a basket range from 12 to 24 and customers by paying in advance agree to take their share of the risks that come with climatic contingencies hélène rouet 43 a former logistics manager volunteering in one amap office quit her job to live in the country with a local producer she said customers who took the produce baskets had a unique link to the food the farmer tells us about the difficulties he s faced it s like he s bringing us his babies she said even when they ve found land and distribution some still find themselves having to commute to their land whereas older farmers often live on the edge of their fields new entrants often can t afford to buy the buildings on their farms if there are any some buy shabby trailers to stay in near their farms or sleep in their cars mr martin said it sometimes took him over two hours to commute to the farm he started work at dawn to plow sow or harvest depending on the season it s worth it mr martin said for now ',\n",

       " 'judith katherine dunning had been waiting anxiously for california to adopt legislation that would make it legal for her to end her life the cancer in her brain was progressing despite several rounds of treatment at 68 she spent most of her day asleep and needed an aide to help with basic tasks more centrally ms dunning who poignantly had worked as an oral historian in berkeley calif was losing her ability to speak even before the end of life option act became law in october 2015 she had recorded a video expressing her desire to hasten her death the video she hoped would make her wishes clear in case there were any doubts later on she felt she had completed all the important tasks of her life recalled her physician dr michael rabow director of the symptom management service at the university of california san francisco when she could no longer communicate life was no longer worth living in recent months this option has become available to a growing number of americans last june legislation took effect in california the most populous state in november colorado voters approved a ballot measure by nearly a majority the district of columbia council has passed a similar law and the mayor quietly signed it last month aid in dying was already legal in washington vermont montana and oregon so even if the district of columbia s law is blocked as a prominent republican representative has threatened to do the country has arrived at a remarkable moment close to 20 percent of americans live in jurisdictions where adults can legally end their lives if they are terminally ill and meet eligibility requirements the laws all based on the death with dignity act oregon adopted in 1997 allow physicians to write prescriptions for lethal drugs when patients qualify the somewhat complicated procedure involves two oral requests and a written one extensive discussions and approval by two physicians patients must have the mental capacity to make medical decisions while that process took shape in oregon two decades ago the cultural and political context surrounding it has changed considerably the states recently considering the issue differ from earlier adopters and as opposition from some longtime adversaries has softened new obstacles have arisen historically aid in dying has generated fierce resistance from the catholic church from certain activists and from others who cite religious or moral objections even the terminology aid in dying assisted suicide death with dignity creates controversy but the concept has long drawn broad support in public opinion polls polltakers for the general social survey done by norc at the university of chicago have asked a representative national sample this question since 1977 when a person has a disease that cannot be cured do you think doctors should be allowed by law to end the patient s life by some painless means if the patient and his family request it the proportion of americans responding affirmatively always a substantial majority has bounced between 66 and 69 percent for 15 years but support was not evenly distributed such laws initially were enacted in states with predominantly white populations like oregon and to date the vast majority of patients who have used them are white i hear people talk all the time about this being a rich white person s issue said donna smith legislative manager for the district of columbia at the group compassion and choices who is now we have proof on the ground that that is not true indeed aid in dying has expanded to more diverse locales whites represent a minority of californians colorado is more than 21 percent latino in the district of columbia nearly half of whose residents are five of six black council members voted in favor of the legislation state medical societies once active foes of initiatives also have begun shifting their positions citing deep divisions among their members the california medical association the colorado medical society and the medical society of the district of columbia all took officially neutral stances as legislators and voters debated depriving opponents of influential allies so has the state medical society in maryland where legislators plan to reintroduce a bill the third attempt this month the american medical association an opponent since 1993 has asked its council on ethical and judicial affairs to look at the issue and submit a report in june though without recommending any policy but even as the idea gains acceptance passage of a bill or ballot measure does not always make aid in dying broadly available to those who want it in addition to the safeguards the law requires its practice can be balky at least in the early stages state provisions allow any individual or institution to decline to provide prescriptions in california catholic health care systems have opted out predictably but so have a number of others including vitas the nation s largest hospice chain moreover california hospitals and hospices can forbid their affiliated physicians to write the necessary prescriptions even if they are acting privately some health systems with hundreds of doctors have done so vermont colorado and the district of columbia allow doctors to make individual decisions the shortage of participating providers has led to a lot of patient and family frustration said dr laura petrillo palliative care physician at the san francisco v a medical center in an email they had the expectation that it would be available and happen seamlessly once the law went into effect and then find themselves needing to do a lot of legwork to find doctors willing to prescribe lethal drugs and pharmacies to fill prescriptions she said sometimes when patients have waited until late in their illnesses they die before they can become eligible for assisted death or they become too physically or mentally incapacitated to take the drugs themselves as legally required even if they do qualify in areas where many providers opt out very sick patients may have to travel long distances to use the law and costs can also prove a barrier some private insurers pay for the necessary doctors visits and drugs in california most do said matt whitaker state director of compassion and choices the leading advocacy group but congress has long prohibited the use of federal dollars for aid in dying so medicare and the department of veterans affairs will not cover it states like california and oregon have agreed to cover the costs for medicaid recipients others do not cost mattered less years ago when a lethal dose of barbiturates ran a couple of hundred dollars but in 2015 as california legislators introduced their bill valeant pharmaceuticals acquired seconal the most commonly used drug the company known and condemned for a similar strategy with other medications spiked the price a move mr whitaker called ethically and morally bankrupt now patients whose insurers will not cover aid in dying face paying 3 000 to 4 000 for the drug valeant has denied the suggestion that it was exploiting the new law as a result physicians are turning to alternative and combinations of opioids and sedatives for those who cannot afford the standard medication despite such obstacles and disappointments an emboldened compassion and choices with a staff that has tripled since 2008 and an annual budget that has nearly quadrupled to 16 9 million is eyeing its next targets over several years its leaders think they can help legalize aid in dying in maryland hawaii and new york aid in dying it should be noted may be a vehemently debated issue with campaigns that can involve thousands of participants and millions of dollars but it ultimately has affected a tiny proportion of people the number of residents taking advantage of these laws in oregon and washington has climbed in the past two years still after nearly 20 years in oregon and eight in washington far fewer than 1 percent of annual deaths involve a lethal prescription of those residents who do receive one about a third do not use it it s not the way most americans choose to die even when they have the legal option yet the end of life care most people receive needs substantial improvement while partisans fight over aid in dying skeptics like dr rabow note the complicated and expensive measures that could improve care for the great majority overhauled medical education better staffed and operated nursing homes increased access to hospice and palliative care go largely unaddressed still ms dunning was dr rabow s longtime patient when california s act took effect she began the process of requesting lethal medication her speech had slurred further but not yet enough to render her unintelligible dr rabow did not want to see her die and he is no fan of the movement but ms dunning had been clear consistent and determined he wrote the prescription she was ready to have her life end and no amount of support or medication or counseling would change the situation he said in september she invited him to her home where she planned to swallow the fatal slurry of barbiturates on the appointed day dr rabow arrived to find a house full of people who didn t want her to end her life but were there to support her and respect her decision over the course of the day people said their goodbyes then withdrew to leave ms dunning with her closest relatives her hospice nurse and her doctor her son mixed her seconal solution and she swallowed it no simple task for someone with advanced cancer she lost consciousness almost immediately and died several hours later i wished she could have had a natural life span dr rabow said and i would have made a different choice but i was

price who has faced intense scrutiny and criticism from democrats over his stock trades while in congress found a defender in senator rand paul republican of kentucky to question your motives i think is insulting mr paul said to question whether you re honest is insulting democrats have made clear their deep discontent with mr price s nomination but one of them senator michael bennet of colorado found a silver lining with the nominee who happens to be an orthopedic surgeon i have never shown a knee my knee to any nominee before dr price came to my office mr bennet disclosed when it was his turn at wednesday s hearing but he gave me some free medical advice and i m grateful how you doing mr price chimed in showing a glimpse of his bedside manner it s terrible but i ll talk to you after it s over mr bennet said it s not because of you senator elizabeth warren democrat of massachusetts pressed mr price to address mr trump s pledge that he would not cut medicare or medicaid do you believe he was telling the truth she asked i believe so yes mr price said ms warren went on to ask mr price to guarantee that he would safeguard that pledge and not use his administrative power to carry out a single dollar of cuts to medicare or medicaid eligibility or benefits mr price did not provide such an assurance mr pruitt whose hearing attracted dozens of protesters to the capitol defended his position that excessive government regulation was hurting business and energy development mr pruitt said his first and primary goal as administrator of the environmental protection agency would be to return the agency to that core mission of protecting the american people through common sense and lawful regulations he said that farmers ranchers landowners and owners have recently felt hopeless subject to a torrent of new regulations that only a lawyer can understand they fear the e p a and that just shouldn t be the case he said if confirmed i will work tirelessly to ensure that the e p a acts lawfully sensibly and with those americans ever in mind but several senators challenged him lead came up repeatedly in the hearing and mr pruitt has come under fire for his answers in an one round of questioning senator benjamin l cardin democrat of maryland asked do you believe there is any safe level of lead that can be taken into the human body particularly a young person mr pruitt responded that s something i have not reviewed nor know about i would be very concerned about any level of lead going into the drinking water or obviously human consumption but i ve not looked at the scientific research on that as the writer susan matthews at slate noted the e p a says there is no safe level of lead in the bloodstream though its regulations still allow extremely small amounts of lead in plumbing systems mr pruitt s statement led to a strong reaction online there was also a forceful response among the democratic members of the senate in the hearing room senator tammy duckworth of illinois asked incredulously you are seeking to be the e p a administrator and you ve not looked into the issue of lead in our drinking water supply she called that in the aftermath of the water crisis in flint mich a serious oversight on your part mr pruitt responded that the e p a had power to address problems with lead in water and that the agency should have done more in flint the e p a has emergency order authority to respond to incidents of contamination he said and i think the e p a should step into these situations in a very meaningful way senator edward j markey democrat of massachusetts had a feisty exchange with mr pruitt over climate change and ethics mr markey started out by revealing a bit of daylight between the positions of mr trump and mr pruitt on climate change mr markey noted that mr trump has called climate change a hoax created by the chinese mr markey asked whether mr pruitt agreed with the president elect on that point i do not believe that climate change is a hoax mr pruitt replied o k that s important for the president to hear mr markey responded gov nikki haley of south carolina the nominee for united states ambassador to the united nations was the subject of rather mild questioning but that did not mean the hearing was i am concerned with your lack of foreign policy experience said senator benjamin l cardin democrat of maryland and the ranking democrat on the foreign relations committee but he then praised ms haley for leading the fight to take down a confederate battle flag from the south carolina statehouse property for her part ms haley pivoted to an issue of central concern to republicans and many democrats the united nations relationship with israel any honest assessment also finds an institution that is often at odds with u s interests ms haley said noting the body s 20 resolutions against israel more than against syria iran and north korea this cannot continue she said also criticizing the united states abstention from the latest such resolution against israel i will never abstain when the united nations takes any action that comes in direct conflict with the interests and values of the united states she said she also was asked whether she agreed with sanctions on russia i think that russia has to have positive actions before we lift any sanctions on russia what about a muslim registry nope ms haley said not going to happen mr ross kicked off his confirmation hearing by taking a tough stance on china describing the country as protectionist they talk much more about free trade than they actually practice he said mr ross s stance echoed mr trump s own approach the rankled many by accepting a congratulatory phone call from the president of taiwan challenging the one china principle and heightening tensions with the country before he even takes office in an unexpected revelation mr ross admitted he had unknowingly employed an undocumented household worker a fact he said he discovered while preparing for his senate confirmation process mr ross said the employee had presented a social security card and a valid driver s license both bearing that individual s name when hired in 2009 but during a check over the past month the employee had been unable to provide similar documentation he fired the employee immediately he said we did the best that we thought we could do in order to verify the legality of the employment and it turned out that was incorrect mr ross said during that roughly period mr ross said he paid all applicable taxes without incident on that employee using the social security number he had been given ',\n",
       " 'washington the obama administration has written 275 briefing papers for the incoming trump administration nearly 1 000 pages of classified material on north korea s nuclear program the military campaign against the islamic state tensions in the south china sea and every other kind of threat the new team could face in its first weeks in office nobody in the current administration knows whether anyone in the next has read any of it less than three days before president obama turns the keys to the white house and the nuclear codes over to donald j trump mr trump s transition staff has barely engaged with the national security council below the most senior levels his designated national security adviser lt gen michael t flynn has met four times with his obama counterpart susan e rice most recently on tuesday afternoon but the chronic upheaval in mr trump s transition a delay in appointing senior national security council staff members and a dearth of people with security clearances have deprived the trump team of weeks of prep work on some of the most complex national security issues facing the country we really wanted to make sure there was nothing a new team needed to know that we hadn t told them ms rice said in an interview it took them more time than we expected for them to be ready to engage with us now she added we re racing to make up lost time ms rice insisted that she was confident the trump administration would have the information it needed by the time mr trump was sworn in the process has settled down in recent days with the arrival of keith kellogg a retired army general whom mr trump named as chief of staff of the n s c last month and who is now running the transition in a statement mr flynn said members of our incoming team have held extensive meetings with their n s c counterparts he thanked ms rice for her cooperation and assistance last week the two engaged in a public display of harmony shaking hands at a pass the baton conference sponsored by the united states institute of peace still officials from both the obama and trump teams acknowledged that the transition had been rocky in no small part because mr trump s defeat of hillary clinton caught both the outgoing and incoming administrations so completely by surprise had mrs clinton won her staff planned to place a transition team in the n s c within a couple of days in mr trump s case the first contact with the national security council did not come until nov 22 two weeks after election day that delay was caused by the purge of the original transition team led by gov chris christie of new jersey among those swept out was matthew freedman who had been chosen to run the n s c transition but quickly came under scrutiny because of his foreign lobbying ties mr freedman s replacement marshall billingslea a former pentagon and state department official arrived in the west wing with six people only two of whom had security clearances the obama administration began meeting with that team after thanksgiving but its lack of clearances meant that mr trump s emissaries could not read the materials that the obama people had prepared for them the n s c began creating unclassified versions of the papers then in there was another when mr billingslea was replaced by general kellogg who began meeting with his obama counterparts this month by some accounts the situation is even more fluid in the state department and the pentagon where the trump team has devoted much of its attention to lining up cabinet secretaries and will now have to win senate confirmation for dozens of other senior officials officials in the state department s transition office said that they had had only intermittent contact with trump representatives and that those people often changed but the snags in the national security council transition may be more problematic current and former officials said because that is the organization that advises the president on the most urgent foreign policy issues drawing together recommendations from the state department the pentagon the central intelligence agency and other agencies this is the nerve center of the white house said david j rothkopf the chief executive and editor of the fp group who has written a history of the n s c running the world the inside story of the national security council and the architects of american power if your brain isn t functioning your arms and legs aren t going to function because none of the jobs on the national security council require senate confirmation it can in theory be staffed more quickly than other government agencies much of the organization s policy staff is composed of career civil servants who are lent by their agencies to the white house for a limited term of service the trump administration plans to keep on most of these people as the obama administration did but that still leaves a cadre of senior directors who run departments that develop policy on asia western europe russia nonproliferation and other areas while the trump team has chosen several senior directors an official said it has not yet announced them and the efforts have been complicated by outside distractions on monday monica crowley a fox news commentator and writer whom mr trump had named deputy national security adviser for strategic communications announced that she would not take the post after cnn disclosed that she had plagiarized passages of her 2012 book what the bleep just happened later politico reported that she had done the same in her doctoral dissertation mr trump s advisers initially defended ms crowley labeling the plagiarism charges a politically motivated attack but her position became untenable because part of her job would have involved writing speeches harpercollins ms crowley s publisher said it would withdraw the digital edition of her book until she revised the copied passages the monica crowley episode is a sign of failure on several levels mr rothkopf said she wasn t vetted enough and they waited too long after the plagiarism scandal broke to act ms rice said that ensuring a smooth transition had been one of her major priorities for 2016 and that she had set a goal to meet or exceed what the bush administration did for us n s c officials began drafting briefing papers last summer some focused on nuts and bolts how do you arrange meetings how do you circulate information to the agencies others discussed the evolution of administration policies or contingency planning for crises most were three to five pages to make them easy to digest a trump official said that members of the team had read some of the memos and praised their quality but there is an inherent tension in transitions particularly between two administrations with starkly different political views officials in the bush administration said they doubted that the incoming obama people read all the briefing papers they prepared it s difficult because you campaigned on how these guys drove the car into the ditch said peter d feaver who served on the bush n s c now here are memos from the guys who were driving the car and they

       " 'anyone inclined to find joy when a president s taste collides with yours had a lot to choose from with barack obama there was the time he dropped by the los angeles garage where the comedian marc maron records his podcast or when he sat between the two ferns where zach galifianakis pretends to be a boob hosting a talk show at the 2015 white house correspondents association dinner he did a bit with key as luther mr obama s fictional but legitimately irate anger translator from key peele he called kanye west a jackass invited miranda to the white house poetry jam to perform a song from hamilton before hamilton was even a thing and for two straight years dropped thoroughly convincing spotify playlists that doesn t even include the new york review of books conversation in two parts between him and the novelist marilynne robinson they talked about about well it s just sobering and oracular and you should read it but of all the culture barack obama has been a part of inspired commented on or cultivated of all the ways in which the culture seemed to evolve around and unconsciously respond to him the thing that says so much about his unprecedented relationship to art and popular culture is actually in the vast scheme of things just a footnote which is to say it s pretty small yet so illustrative of his sense of respect professionalism and awe it was the time he was emailed for a quote the occasion was the 2015 kennedy center honors the inductees included carole king who sat in the balcony between her fellow inductee george lucas and the first couple and during ms king s tribute out came aretha franklin who sat at a piano in a fur coat and sang you make me feel like a natural woman the classic ms king wrote and ms franklin released in 1967 her appearance was pretty much expected the shock was how powerfully good at 73 ms franklin sounded so good that you worried ecstasy would send ms king toppling off the balcony so good that mr obama wiped tears from his eyes for a critical profile of ms franklin in the new yorker its editor david remnick reached out to the president as a critic i feel a duty to point out that that s an unusual move mr remnick is also among other things a critic he knows ms franklin s worth as an american treasure and that it has no price he s more than equipped to sum her up but he outsourced that job to the president of the united states and if you got to that section of that story and considered rolling your eyes when i emailed president obama about aretha franklin and that night you immediately retreated when you read what mr obama wrote in response nobody embodies more fully the connection between the spiritual the blues r b rock and roll the way that hardship and sorrow were transformed into something full of beauty and vitality and hope he wrote back through his press secretary american history wells up when aretha sings that s why when she sits down at a piano and sings a natural woman she can move me to tears the same way that ray charles s version of america the beautiful will always be in my view the most patriotic piece of music ever performed because it captures the fullness of the american experience the view from the bottom as well as the top the good and the bad and the possibility of synthesis reconciliation transcendence mr remnick wrote to him because he knew that barack obama would deliver mr remnick asked for two cents the president gave him a dollar mr obama for nearly all of his tenure was fully aware of interested in and knowledgeable about popular culture even as it grew impossible to take it all in he tried sports movies television the internet music books he was protean and catholic he was thoughtful and cool and yet far from it he was a version of america s dad and the dad some kids wished theirs could be fit for world leadership fit for a sitcom lots of smart people are poring over mr obama s record to divine a legacy which policies will last how did he change the job how did he distinguish himself but this was a presidency whose few faint whiffs of scandal included being surreptitiously videoed last year by usher dancing listlessly to drake s hotline bling which was more than a year old so to be fair it s an addictive song and he moved like someone who had been dancing to it since it came out in other words mr obama s place in popular culture has always felt new alive and mostly underappreciated obviously other presidents have had a relationship with american culture television was in its creative infancy when dwight d eisenhower entered office in 1953 and he took quick advantage of the power of its immediacy when john f kennedy turned 45 he received american history s most famous happy birthday from marilyn monroe but it was tragedy and a glamorous wife that ensured kennedy s legacy in popular culture richard nixon disliked all in the family and was an avid moviegoer who according to mark feeney s surprising book nixon at the movies watched about 500 films during his presidency ronald reagan was a hollywood actor before he was a politician and as a candidate bill clinton made a lot of sense on mtv and arsenio hall s talk show but has any president been as conversant in the art and popular culture of this country as barack obama who has been as committed to opening up the white house to the sorts of artists he has lunches with the novelists zadie smith barbara kingsolver junot díaz dave eggers and colson whitehead one lunch actually that was one lunch initiative summits that included alicia keys nicki minaj j cole ludacris rick ross pusha t common and chance the rapper so many different rappers and rb singers have come through the white house in the last eight years that the bet awards could sue for copyright infringement last year barack and michelle obama hosted jazz at the white house which featured appearances by so many magnificent important people that to type out all the names chick corea dee dee bridgewater ms franklin for openers is to make a very fancy shopping list mr obama brought all kinds of art and culture into the white house and he sought culture out at the same time how we experience that art and culture changed as much as the culture itself when he entered office in 2009 netflix was a service now it s a major reason we no longer watch tv we scarf it down but that disruption from channels and networks to platforms and apps also unleashed tv that looked more like america more nonwhite characters more women more gays he presided over an era in which television and movies grappled with the meaning and meaninglessness of race whether to laugh at it or take it seriously or ignore it altogether whether the idea of a postracial america was ever possible as though electing a black man for eight years erases the traumas of 400 to that end 30 rock was the great situation comedy a workplace farce on and loosely about nbc that hit its stride in 2008 and ran until 2013 not so secretly it was about the insurmountable work of race and gender meanwhile the american movie industry went all in on franchises and sequels while leaving art and humanity for tv but the fast and furious movies did bounce off the assembly line the series started in 2001 essentially died in 2003 and came roaring back to life at the start of mr obama s first term and is ludicrously yet thankfully on the verge of an eighth installment the protagonists are car thieves turned action heroes who are mostly black asian latina or racially ambiguous these aren t great movies but they re great fun serious and without too much or any and they take an issue that hollywood has always struggled with what to do with all these talented interesting people of color and laughs at it what to do it s not that hard let em drive mr obama had his priorities straight of course pop culture and art aren t aspects of american life that should dominate a presidency they have little to do with the business of governance but mr obama has always seemed to understand the importance of culture as mirror window escape hatch and haven the obamas were catholic in their tastes not because they had to be but because that s what we should be open their minds were open their hearts were open their arms were open to the willie nelsons the beyoncés the junot díazes to all kinds of excellence one of the happiest cultural events i ve ever watched was the presidential medal of freedom ceremony in november the honor went to 21 men and women from robert de niro and tom hanks and michael jordan to cicely tyson and diana ross and ellen degeneres bill and melinda gates were honored so were maya lin and robert redford mr obama had good material for most of them philanthropists movies stars architect alike and as he so often does and gets nary enough credit for he delivered it with perfectly timed drollery he could easily enjoy a second career as a comedian these people meant something to him his joshing notwithstanding a few of them appeared to mean everything the knock on mr obama was that he was dry and aloof perhaps but not always he understood what laughter could do he knew the power of songs he knew the power of singers even if the only person doing the singing was at first only him in 2015 at the memorial service after the charleston massacre he takes a dramatic deliberative pause before intoning the lyrics to amazing grace he starts and the choir behind him rises out of surprise you can tell he s not singing because he thinks his baritone sounds good he s singing because something s come over him the way it does me the way it does lots of people what appears to have come over him at that memorial is both a sincere holiness and a rare powerfully particular recognition of the glory and tragic risk of being black and american he had to sing in that moment that song was all he seemed to have that s not a sensation you go looking for it finds you good historians tend to know the right moment to evaluate a president s place they wait until the office is behind him for the right mix of distance and scholarship in the meantime barack obama s performance as president meaning the performance he gave in the role of president of the united states was flawless culturally speaking he didn t use his office to lift up enlighten and entertain so much as share it he wrote to david remnick that he loved ray charles s version of america the beautiful because it captures the fullness of the american experience the view from the bottom as well as the top the good and the bad and the possibility of synthesis reconciliation transcendence the man knows his country and his ray but it s entirely possible to read that quote and catch a chill because mr obama could easily have been writing about himself ',\n",
       " 'annapolis md it was early fall and donald j trump behind in the polls seemed to be preparing a rationale in case a winner like him somehow managed to lose i m afraid the election is going to be rigged i have to be honest the republican nominee told a crowd in columbus ohio he was hearing more and more about evidence of rigging he added leaving the details to his supporters imagination a few weeks later cameron harris a new college graduate with a fervent interest in maryland republican politics and a need for cash sat down at the kitchen table in his apartment to fill in the details mr trump had left out in a dubious art just coming into its prime this bogus story would be his masterpiece mr harris started by crafting the headline breaking tens of thousands of fraudulent clinton votes found in ohio warehouse it made sense he figured to locate this shocking discovery in the very city and state where mr trump had highlighted his rigged meme i had a theory when i sat down to write it recalled mr harris a former college quarterback and fraternity leader given the severe distrust of the media among trump supporters anything that parroted trump s talking points people would click trump was saying rigged election rigged election people were predisposed to believe hillary clinton could not win except by cheating in a raucous election year defined by stories mr harris was a practitioner a boutique operator with no ties to russian spy agencies or macedonian fabrication factories as mr trump takes office this week the beneficiary of at least a modest electoral boost from a flood of fakery mr harris and his website christiantimesnewspaper com make for an illuminating tale contacted by a reporter who had discovered an electronic clue that revealed his secret authorship of christiantimesnewspaper com he was wary at first chagrined to be unmasked this topic is rather sensitive mr harris said noting that he was trying to build a political consulting business and needed to protect his reputation but eventually he agreed to tell the story of his foray into fake news a very gig that he calculated paid him about 1 000 an hour in web advertising revenue he seemed to regard his experience with a combination of guilt about having spread falsehoods and pride at doing it so skillfully at his kitchen table that night in september mr harris wondered who might have found these fraudulent clinton ballots so he invented randall prince a electrical worker this everyman a trump supporter whose name hinted at a sort of nobility had entered a back room at the warehouse and stumbled upon stacked boxes of ballots for mrs clinton mr harris decided no one really goes in this building it s mainly used for storage by a commercial plumber prince said in case anyone missed the significance of the find mr harris made it plain what he found could allegedly be evidence of a massive operation designed to deliver clinton the crucial swing state a photograph he thought would help erase doubts about his yarn with a quick google image search for ballot boxes he landed on a shot of a balding fellow standing behind black plastic boxes that helpfully had ballot box labels it was a photo from the birmingham mail showing a british election 3 700 miles from columbus but no matter in the caption the balding briton got a new name mr prince shown here poses with his find as election officials investigate the article explained that the clinton campaign s likely goal was to slip the fake ballot boxes in with the real ballot boxes when they went to official election judges on november 8th then mr harris added a touch of breathlessness this story is still developing he wrote and ctn will bring you more when we have it he pushed the button and the story was launched on sept 30 blazing across the web like some kind of counterfeit comet even before i posted it i knew it would take off mr harris recalled he was correct the ballot box story promoted by a facebook pages mr harris had created for the purpose flew around the web fueled by indignant comments from people who were certain that mrs clinton was going to cheat mr trump of victory and who welcomed the proof it was eventually shared with six million people according to crowdtangle which tracks web audiences the next day the franklin county ohio board of elections announced that it was investigating and that the fraud claims appeared to be untrue within days ohio s secretary of state jon husted issued a statement to deny the story a christian myself i take offense to reading such unbelievable lies from a publication alleging christian ties mr husted said there was nothing especially christian about his efforts mr harris admits he had simply bought the abandoned web address for 5 at expireddomains net within a few days the story which had taken him 15 minutes to concoct had earned him about 5 000 that was a sizable share of the 22 000 an accounting statement shows he made during the presidential campaign from ads for shoes hair gel and web design that google had placed on his site he had put in perhaps half an hour a week on the fake news site he said for a total of about 20 hours he would come close to a far bigger payday one that might have turned the 5 he had spent on the christian times domain into more than 100 000 the money not the politics was the point he insisted he had graduated from davidson college in north carolina in may and he needed to pay his living expenses i spent the money on student loans car payments and rent he said by the time he launched his fraudulent story on ballot fraud he had found minimal success with hillary clinton blames racism for cincinnati gorilla s death a reference to the sad tale of harambe the gorilla shot after he grabbed a little boy visiting the zoo he had done better with early morning explosion in dc allegedly leaves yet another dnc staffer dead spinning off conspiracy theories around the earlier shooting death of a democratic national committee staff member later he would tell gullible readers nypd looking to press charges against bill clinton for underage sex ring protesters beat homeless veteran to death in philadelphia and hillary clinton files for divorce in new york courts eight of his stories would merit explicit debunking by snopes com the site but none would top the performance of the ballot box fantasy president obama thought the fake news phenomenon significant enough to mention it as a threat to democracy in his farewell speech in chicago last week increasingly he said we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information whether it s true or not that fits our opinions instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there that was exactly the insight on which mr harris said he built his transient business that people wanted to be fed evidence however implausible to support their beliefs at first it kind of shocked me the response i was getting he said how easily people would believe it it was almost like a sociological experiment added mr harris who majored in political science and economics by his account though he voted for mr trump his early preference had been for senator marco rubio mr harris said he would have been willing to promote mrs clinton and smear mr trump had those tactics been lucrative but as other seekers of clicks discovered mr trump s supporters were far more fervent than mrs clinton s in late october with the inevitable end of his venture approaching mr harris sought an appraisal for the web domain that by then had vaulted into the web s top 20 000 sites an appraiser said that given the traffic he could probably sell it for between 115 000 and 125 000 but mr harris made a costly mistake he decided to wait days after the election denounced for making the peddling of fake news remunerative google announced that it would no longer place ads on sites promoting clearly fabricated stories a few days later when mr harris checked his site the ads were gone he checked with the appraiser and was told that the domain was now essentially worthless all was not lost however he had put a on the site inviting visitors to join the stop the steal team to find out how hillary plans to steal the election and what you can do to stop her and collected 24 000 email addresses he has not yet decided what to do with them he said asked whether he felt any guilt at having spread lies about a presidential candidate mr harris grew thoughtful but he took refuge in the notion that politics is by its nature replete with exaggerations and outright whoppers so he was hardly adding much to the sum total hardly anything a campaign or a candidate says is completely true he said lately he has picked up mr trump s refrain that mainstream news organizations are themselves regular purveyors of fake news last week when buzzfeed released what it called an explosive but unverified dossier suggesting that russia had planned to bribe and blackmail mr trump mr harris wrote on twitter he did not mention his own expertise in the field ',\n",

her well with generous pay and health insurance but in when management announced that the dancers would perform at the inauguration of donald j trump ms pearl did something that a rockette is never supposed to do she stepped out of line breaking with the silent smiling solidarity that defines the institution to denounce the idea of celebrating a man with a history of objectifying women in a rare collision of presidential politics and a venerable arts organization current and former rockettes find themselves in a new kind of spotlight a position both painful and empowering as they take sides over the inauguration a split illustrating the cultural divide that trump has cleaved through the country we are a group of women that is encouraging young girls to be strong independent women to fulfill their dreams to go for it ms pearl 27 said in her first interview since the inaugural uproar began it s about women s rights but patty decarlo grantham the president of the rockette alumnae

inauguration performance wrote by email the new york times has had an trump agenda for quite some time and now the rockettes are on the receiving end of their bias this article is based on interviews over the last three weeks with ms pearl who was a rockette until this month and nine former rockettes as well as others in the extended rockette organization several people spoke anonymously for fear that if they were to speak publicly the madison square garden company would take legal action against them the backlash over the inauguration performance began on twitter and facebook after ms pearl wrote a private instagram post i am speaking for just myself but please know that after we found out this news we have been performing with tears in our eyes and heavy hearts ms pearl wrote she believes a friend of hers shared her photo with the celebrity gossip blog perez hilton she and her fellow performers would later learn that their performance at the inauguration would not be mandatory as some feared but it was too late to stop criticism from strangers who took to social media to tell her to shut up and dance supporters wondered whether she and her fellow dancers were under a gag order a news crew ms pearl said showed up at her harlem apartment that sort of attention came as a shock within the world of the rockettes which is devoted to a particular kind of synchronicity where no one person dominates the stage a radio city rockette is a specialist in precision dance technique a rare regimented and intricate style that requires both athleticism and artistry rockettes must stand between and and uphold a standard of elegance along with an expertise in tap modern dance jazz and ballet they must hit positions with military exactitude it s a style that requires a dancer to step into a line not to take over and not to be left behind it takes fortitude and humility you don t realize how much individuality you have as a dancer until you re asked to dance like 35 other women said jessica mcroberts 39 a former rockette things down to your pinkie finger under the leadership of linda haberman who began directing and choreographing touring productions of the christmas spectacular in 1993 the rockettes gained artistic respect and became modernized with more challenging choreography ms haberman left the organization in 2014 and declined a request for comment despite requests the madison square garden company did not make the troupe s current director karen keeler available for interviews the rigors of performing and traveling as a company often allow dancers to form close and lasting bonds according to ms grantham the alumnae president who was a rockette from 1959 until 1970 ms grantham said that the rockettes have a long history of performing for presidents and at events in new york city hosted by both republicans and democrats one time we did benefits for both parties in one night she said one was at the sheraton and the other was at the hilton this wouldn t be the first time the rockettes performed for a controversial president but the volatile media climate surrounding mr trump s inauguration is unusual rhonda malkin a former rockette who worked as a personal trainer to ivanka trump and jared kushner for two years said that the trump and kushner families were supportive of her career as a rockette once they attended a performance to see her dance i think they would like to see the rockettes perform at the inauguration she said of the trump family whether or not that causes a rift throughout the brand is yet to be seen ms malkin 38 said that several of the current rockettes she knows are upset that a crew of 13 rockettes were initially told by their union the american guild of variety artists that they would be forced to perform there are some career rockettes who are very upset about this ms malkin said of the inauguration plans i ve also heard the women of color are very upset from what i have heard it has just caused a real rift in the company ms malkin who was a rockette for 12 years said ms pearl took a real risk for speaking out but she doubts that the controversy surrounding the inauguration has caused any lasting damage to the brand i would honestly say that the majority of our audience members are white christian conservative people ms malkin said and those folks probably supported trump of mr dolan the madison square garden chairman she added he knows those are the people who buy tickets to those shows while the rockettes are an american symbol as much as radio city music hall or mr trump and his branded buildings the group s individual dancers remain fairly anonymous they don t speak unless deemed by the madison square garden company which has fiercely protected them against criticism surrounding the inauguration for a while we weren t allowed to say i m going to be on the today show with the rockettes tomorrow morning said naomi kakuk 40 a former rockette you d say watch the today show tomorrow you might see a familiar face we couldn t even say we were on a show that was promoting the show mr dolan has been criticized for making the inauguration deal and guarding the rockettes from media requests but several former dancers praised his management style which include generous benefits being a rockette is among the most lucrative jobs a dancer can get in new york complete with health insurance even though the company performs on a seasonal basis ms kakuk who loved her time as a rockette said you get six months of pay for three months of work and it is six months worth of work in three months because it s so incredibly intense she added that some of the dancers live in new york during the christmas show and then go home to wisconsin or florida to teach you have insurance for the year you have a great paycheck you do all these fun gigs and side things and you re doing the show and dancing on the great stage ms kakuk said you re skinny as hell when you get out you re bikini ready in january it s amazing cheryl cutlip who danced as a rockette for 15 years and left the company in 2008 said that benefits were ushered in quickly after the tv company cablevision bought radio city music hall in 1997 ms cutlip 45 remembered mr dolan meeting with the rockettes to go over their basic needs she said he gave them his personal email address soon rockettes no longer had to rush out of the door to find coffee and a bagel in the space between performance preparations he started bringing food in ms cutlip said of mr dolan once he saw the practical needs of the rockettes he started meeting them for other former rockettes the current controversy reminded them of clashes between the dancers their union and their corporate employer lora pavilack a former rockette said she had been locked out of the building twice once for talking to the news media and another time during contentious negotiations over a union contract that s the culture she said and that s why they ve lined up with the ms malkin said that she was also locked out with ms pavilack during contract negotiations in 2005 madison square garden officials declined to comment for this article but they have said in the past that no one had been locked out during contract negotiations more than enough rockettes wanted to perform at the inaugural but ms kakuk also knows some who are not participating i think some of them are done anyway she said and they were like this is the last straw i m out ms pearl is one of them on a recent evening she ended weeks of silence by taking part in a toast to the first amendment presented by the bessies or the new york dance and performance awards people have been calling me courageous ms pearl said at the toast her voice cracking but i don t see it that way i m just standing up for human rights many in the dance world including yvonne rainer the postmodern giant who was part of the toast and several former rockettes including ms kakuk have voiced enthusiasm for ms pearl s action and her talent as a dancer when you see her onstage as a rockette you watch her ms kakuk said she s outspoken but less so than others it was a bit of a surprise with the latest holiday season behind her ms pearl has decided to leave the organization and forge a path in film and television she found inspiration in the actress meryl streep who spoke out against mr trump at the golden globes she can speak freely ms pearl said i wish to have the opportunity to speak as freely as i can without any repercussion but stepping out of the line is just not the rockettes way usually artists are more outspoken ms kakuk said but rockettes as a brand is not very outspoken you work for a giant corporation and a lot of girls don t realize that they just think they re dancing ',\n",

       " 'washington until tuesday the fight over betsy devos s nomination to be secretary of education revolved mostly around her support of contentious school choice programs but her confirmation hearing that night opened her up to new criticism that her long battle for school choice controversial as it has been is the sum total of her experience and understanding of education policy in questioning by senators she seemed either unaware or unsupportive of the longstanding policies and functions of the department she is in line to lead from special education rules to the policing of universities ms devos admitted that she might have been confused when she appeared not to know that the broad statute that has governed special education for more than four decades is federal law a billionaire investor education philanthropist and michigan republican activist ms devos acknowledged that she has no personal experience with student loans the federal government is the largest provider and said she would have to review the department s policies that try to prevent fraud by colleges she appeared blank on basic education terms asked how school performance should be assessed she did not know the difference between growth which measures how much students have learned over a given period and proficiency which measures how many students reach a targeted score ms devos even became something of an internet punch line when she suggested that some school officials should be allowed to carry guns on the premises to defend against grizzly bears but if she was sometimes rattled on the specifics ms devos was unshakable in her belief that education authority should devolve away from the federal government and toward state and local authorities whether the issue was allowing guns in schools how to investigate sexual assault on college campuses or how to measure learning her answer was always that states and what she called locales knew best those answers reflected the same instinct that has driven her advocacy of school choice primarily vouchers which take money from public schools to help families pay tuition at private schools and charter schools which are publicly funded but typically independent of school district or union rules as she said bluntly in a 2015 education speech government really sucks ms devos s supporters defended her performance at the hearing saying she showed herself to be a champion of innovation against democrats defending the status quo they tried their best to turn her into cruella de vil but america got to see the real betsy devos first hand said ed patru a spokesman for a group calling itself friends of betsy devos the country saw an authentic compassionate and eminently reasonable education leader who is committed to empowering parents and putting kids first with a senate ms devos is still likely to be confirmed but her statements on special education could make her vulnerable families of children with special needs are a vocal lobby one that republicans do not want to alienate the federal individuals with disabilities education act or idea has governed special education in the nation s public schools since the before the law states and local school districts had been excluding or essentially warehousing students with disabilities complaints from states and local school districts have been less about the law than about the federal government s failure to pay its promised share of the costs but at the hearing ms devos questioned the basic premise that the federal government has a role in ensuring that any school receiving taxpayer dollars whether a traditional public school a charter or a private school accepting vouchers comply with the law s requirements for students with special needs senator tim kaine of virginia last year s democratic nominee for vice president asked ms devos whether schools that receive tax dollars should be required to meet the requirements of idea i think that is a matter that s best left to the states ms devos replied mr kaine came back so some states might be good to kids with disabilities and other states might not be so good and then what people can just move around the country if they don t like how their kids are being treated ms devos repeated i think that is an issue that s best left to the states it s federal law an exasperated mr kaine replied mr kaine then asked if all elementary and secondary schools receiving tax dollars should be required to comply with reporting requirements on harassment discipline and bullying ms devos answered i would look forward to reviewing that provision senator maggie hassan democrat of new hampshire pressed ms devos about whether she really intended to say that states could ignore the law were you unaware that it was federal law ms hassan asked ms devos answered i may have confused it ms hassan who has a son with cerebral palsy expressed concerns about private schools that accept vouchers on the condition that students waive legal rights under federal education law do you think families should have recourse in the courts if schools don t meet their needs she asked senator i assure you that if confirmed i will be very sensitive to the needs of special needs students ms devos said it s not about sensitivity although that helps ms hassan countered it s about being willing to enforce the law to make sure that my child and every child has the same access to public education public education in her opening statement ms devos spoke of wanting to expand options for higher education beyond traditional brick and mortar and ivy senator elizabeth warren a massachusetts democrat asked ms devos whether she would enforce education policies intended to prevent fraud at colleges institutions like trump university which paid to settle federal class action lawsuits accusing it of using marketing tactics to enroll students i will review that rule and see that it is actually achieving what the intentions are ms devos said ms warren in apparent disbelief responded swindlers and crooks are out there doing back flips when they hear an answer like this she added if confirmed you will be the cop on the beat and if you can t commit to use the tools already available to you in the department of education then i don t see how you can be the secretary of education

       " 'davos switzerland you have perhaps noticed that in many countries numbers of people have grown enraged at the economic elite and their tendency to hog the spoils of globalization this wave of anger has delivered donald j trump to the white house sent britain toward the exit of the european union and threatened the future of global trade the people gathered here this week in the swiss alps for the annual world economic forum have noticed this too they are the elite heads of state billionaire hedge fund managers technology executives they are eager to talk about how to set things right soothing the populist fury by making globalization a more lucrative proposition for the masses myriad panel discussions are focused on finding the best way to reform capitalism make globalization work and revive the middle class what is striking is what generally is not discussed bolstering the power of workers to bargain for better wages and redistributing wealth from the top to the bottom that agenda is anathema to a lot of davos men and women said joseph e stiglitz a nobel laureate economist and author of numerous books on globalization and economic inequality more rights to bargain for workers that s the part where davos man is going to get stuck the stark reality is that globalization has reduced the bargaining power of workers and corporations have taken advantage of it davos is at least rhetorically consumed with worries about the shortcomings of globalization about the deepening anxieties of the middle class in many developed economies about the threat of trade protectionism and its attendant hit to economic growth about the fear that robots are on the verge of sowing mass unemployment it is a conversation fueled in part by fear if the world is indeed in the throes of a populist insurrection the pitchforks could do worse than to point here the davos elites have enjoyed outsize influence over economic policies in recent decades as a growing share of wealth has perhaps not coincidentally landed in the coffers of people with a need for bank accounts in the british virgin islands while poor and households have seen their earnings stagnate and decline yet the solutions that have currency seem calculated to spare corporations and the wealthiest people from having to make any sacrifices at all as if there is a way to be found to tilt the balance of inequality while those at the top hang on to everything they have more entrepreneurialism mindfulness training education focused on the modern ways of technology these are the sorts of items that tend to get discussed here as the response to the plight of those left behind by globalization that perhaps private equity overseers should not be paid 1 000 times as much as teachers while availing themselves of tax breaks is thinking that gets little airing here at a dinner on monday evening as the forum got underway ian goldin a professor of globalization and development at oxford university celebrated the connectedness of the global economy and the technological advancements that have liberated humans from disease poverty and the drudgery of manual labor there s never been a better time to be alive and yet we feel so glum mr goldin said so many people feel anxious so many people feel that this is one of the most dangerous times he denounced the frightened retreat from globalization manifest in mr trump s threats of a trade war with china and in britain s abandonment of europe commonly known as brexit you can t stop managing an entangled environment by disconnecting he said this is the fundamental mistake of brexit of trump and of so many others we are not simply connected we are entangled our lives our destinies are intertwined what happens in china what happens in indonesia what happens in india what happens across europe and what happens in north america across africa and latin america will affect all of us in dramatic new ways the idea that somehow we can forge our future in an insular way even for the biggest countries like the u s is a fantasy and yet mr goldin said if the benefits of globalization are not spread more equitably the world could be in for a replay of the renaissance an extraordinary period of scientific progress commercial growth and artistic creativity in europe that ultimately yielded popular resentment the gold leaf landing on cathedrals was not bettering the lot of the peasantry the spices coming in from asia were too expensive for most the medici family that ruled florence was sent packing by the mob intellectuals were persecuted and books burned we need to learn these historical lessons and realize that this is the most precious moment in human history mr goldin said we need to make the choices to ensure that globalization is sustainable that connectivity is sustainable that we deal with the intractable problems that are worrying people but mr goldin s comments were merely the prelude to a conversation that was supposed to be about how to pull that off the answers from the corporate executives who comprised a panel could be crudely boiled down to this the people who have not benefited from globalization need to try harder to emulate those who have succeeded abidali neemuchwala the chief executive officer of wipro the global information technology and consulting company that hosted the event along with the financial times and who last year earned some 1 8 million plus stock grants worth an additional 2 million or so said working people would have to pursue training for the jobs of the future people have to take more ownership of upgrading themselves on a continuous basis he said no one can reasonably argue against the merits of training or entrepreneurialism for that matter the jobs of the future have not yet been invented new skills will be required to seize them but nowhere in the discussion was there a mention of tax policy or addressing the soaring costs of gaining higher education or access to health care at a panel on wednesday morning christine lagarde managing director of the international monetary fund injected a rarely heard word into a conversation about the crisis for households redistribution there are things that can be done she said it probably means more redistribution than we have at the moment but then the conversation moved on to other subjects ray dalio founder of the american investment firm bridgewater associates who took home 1 4 billion in compensation in 2015 suggested the key to reinvigorating the middle class was to create a favorable environment for making money he touted in particular the animal spirits unleashed by stripping away regulations for years economic inequality has ranked as one of the most discussed issues at davos both in the formal conference agenda and in the conversations that fill hallways and the private parties and dinners held throughout town for years little to nothing has changed people talk about inequality how it s a major problem the greatest threat to globalization and the global economy mr stiglitz said you have to recognize that the way we have managed globalization has contributed significantly to inequality but i have not yet heard a good conversation about what changes in globalization would address inequality that is not an accident he surmised any sincere list would have to include items that involve transferring wealth and power from the sorts of people who come to davos to ordinary workers via more progressive taxation increased bargaining rights for labor unions and greater protections for labor in general same as every other year davos is again plastered with the slogan of the world economic forum committed to improving the state of the world but whatever improvements are supposed to be made one can safely assume they will not conflict with those in attendance continuing to enjoy the state of the world as it is now with canapés and aged bordeaux and

       " 'dresden germany at a beer hall on tuesday evening the lean blond man s voice boomed out over a crowd of hundreds some and but with a contingent of polished young professionals the afd is the last revolutionary the last peaceful chance for our fatherland declared the man björn höcke referring to the political party alternative for germany and employing a reverential term for germany one of several nationalist buzzwords usually shunned in the country s politics jawohl a few shouted yes when mr höcke pronounced lamented that german history is handled as rotten and made to look ridiculous a subtle but clear reference to guilt for the holocaust and other nazi war crimes the crowd responded by chanting deutschland deutschland his speech at the rally in dresden on tuesday touched off a wave of national alarm by challenging germany s national atonement for the holocaust and for its nazi crimes his comments drew broad criticism for their venom and because mr höcke a rising star in the afd has found growing success with his messages of extreme nationalism shouting to be heard over cheering supporters many of whom stood mr höcke challenged the collective national guilt over the war that has restrained german politics for three generations at times he used language that seemed to hint at lamenting nazi germany s defeat germans were the only people in the world to plant a monument of shame in the heart of its capital he said referring to a memorial to murdered jews in berlin he added that germans had the mentality of a totally vanquished people mr höcke who began his speech by triumphantly raising his arms over his head represents the rightward flank of alternative for germany an already party but his speech and the crowd s energetic reception of his words offer a glimpse of the relatively new party s threat to german politics he is on the fringe but that fringe is growing in numbers and in willingness to defy the usual restraints to the rising alarm of germany s establishment leaders who on wednesday denounced his comments sigmar gabriel leader of the social democrats and the country s vice chancellor shot back in a facebook post showing a banner splashed across an image of mr höcke standing at a lectern reading to remember the millions of victims of the nazis is no weakness baiting the helpless to promote yourself is weakness the chairman of the green party for the state of saxony jürgen kasek on twitter called for the speech to be checked for possible violations of laws he accused mr höcke of saying things that violated the spirit of the constitution in the style of national socialism the central council of jews in germany in a statement called the comments deeply deplorable and fully unacceptable charlotte knobloch a former president of the council told the newspaper stimme heilbronner that mr höcke s speech was unbearable agitation and she warned that the afd is poisoning the political culture and social debate in germany mr höcke s comments even drew a rebuke from the chairwoman of alternative for germany frauke petry who said they were out of line and straining the party ms petry and mr höcke have been locked in a power struggle for months over how far to the right to position the party which was originally founded on an platform the party is polling at nearly 15 percent ahead of some mainstream parties for this fall s national election its rapid rise demonstrates that german nationalist politics can find a foothold in unexpected places for example among educated young people like those at tuesday s rally those many in coat and tie looked and primly trendy most of the men wore their hair buzzed close on the sides and long and floppy on top separated by a severe side parting that seemed unmistakably evocative of hitler s mainstream parties in germany have long eschewed politics in the style of movements and have avoided shows of overt nationalism but that leaves an opening a populist party like alternative for germany can indulge those ideas just enough to excite its supporters without scaring off larger groups of voters the alternative for germany supporters who were gathered in dresden the capital of saxony seemed animated in a way that is unusual when it comes to modern politics in germany most germans rarely feel allowed to get excited about their political beliefs or just as sensitive an issue about their national identity the atmosphere lent the evening a feeling of thrilling transgression as if the act of cheering ideas was as important or perhaps more so than the ideas themselves julian m wälder a law student said he had initially joined the youth league of the christian democratic union the party to which chancellor angela merkel belongs but the party did not feel like real politics he said alternative for germany mr wälder said finally felt genuine this is a core part of the party s message while other parties are all the same only alternative for germany really expresses the popular will mr wälder and other young attendees seemed tense the location of the gathering was kept secret until that morning in a failed attempt to avoid the protesters who often gather outside the semiregular rallies but they were jovial the rally on tuesday felt if not like a watershed then a glimpse of a wider more gradual change calls for asserting a strong national identity are not pernicious on their own all nations have identities after all but they remain somewhat taboo in germany and that taboo is precisely the point only the fringes would be brazen enough to champion a nationalist identity but that risks letting those fringes define its contours mr höcke for instance disavowed a famous 1985 speech by richard von weizsacker then the president of germany that called for the allied victory to be seen as the liberation of the german people not as their defeat mr höcke called mr weizsacker s address a speech against his own people and not for his own people since 2015 when germany received nearly a million asylum seekers alternative for germany has sought to portray national identity as under threat from migration and multiculturalism establishment parties and other enemies mr höcke told the crowd are liquidating our beloved german fatherland like a piece of soap under warm running water but we we beloved friends we patriots we will close this open tap and we will win back our germany piece by piece yascha mounk a lecturer at harvard and a fellow at the transatlantic academy of the german marshall fund said germany had a style of government that could leave an especially wide opening for fringe parties because the german parties tend to govern in a grand coalition voters often see little change when parties shift in and out politics in germany usually play out in quiet polite negotiations among members of the coalition rather than in dramatic public clashes between competing parties the coalition blocks fringe parties like alternative for germany which can then paint mainstream politics as an elite conspiracy to impose unpopular policies and to shut down real debate the crowd at one point chanted a line mr wälder has also used we are the outsiders it was a jarring moment as many of the outsiders were young white and wore suits and ties seemingly the definition of an insider in germany because these young germans say that the political establishment has denied them sufficient pride in their national identity they feel as if they are being oppressed even though they have every right and live in a country that has one of europe s economies but young and old supporters of alternative for germany seemed to find something at tuesday s rally that is not common among politics a sense of impending victory not in the sense that they would oust ms merkel s government this fall she is likely to retain power but in the belief that their movement would quickly shape and perhaps one day overcome a system that they see as denying them their german pride mr mounk said that the rise of extremist voices may have been inevitable given the failure of mainstream parties to satisfy the desires for national and for charismatic politics that left an opening for mr höcke to deliver a message beyond the usual gripes about being too ashamed of being german mr mounk added implying though never quite stating outright that defeat in 1945 was a bad thing mr höcke concluded his speech on tuesday with a rallying call beloved friends we must do little less than make history so that there will be for us germans us europeans a future he said as the audience stood cheered and chanted his name he added we can make history and we are doing it ',\n",
       " 'marking another milestone for a changing planet scientists reported on wednesday that the earth reached its highest temperature on record in 2016 trouncing a record set only a year earlier which beat one set in 2014 it is the first time in the modern era of global warming data that temperatures have blown past the previous record three years in a row the findings come two days before the inauguration of an american president who has called global warming a chinese plot and vowed to roll back his predecessor s efforts to cut emissions of gases in reality the earth is heating up a point long beyond serious scientific dispute but one becoming more evident as the records keep falling temperatures are heading toward levels that many experts believe will pose a profound threat to both the natural world and to human civilization in 2015 and 2016 the planetary warming was intensified by the weather pattern known as el niño in which the pacific ocean released a huge burst of energy and water vapor into the atmosphere but the bigger factor in setting the records was the trend of rising temperatures which scientists say is being driven by increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases a single warm year is something of a curiosity said deke arndt chief of global climate monitoring for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration it s really the trend and the fact that we re punching at the ceiling every year now that is the real indicator that we re undergoing big changes the heat extremes were especially pervasive in the arctic with temperatures in the fall running 20 to 30 degrees fahrenheit above normal across large stretches of the arctic ocean sea ice in that region has been in precipitous decline for years and arctic communities are already wrestling with enormous problems such as rapid coastal erosion caused by the changing climate what s going on in the arctic is really very impressive this year was ridiculously off the chart said gavin a schmidt head of the goddard institute for space studies in manhattan a unit of the national aeronautics and space administration that tracks global temperatures but arctic people were hardly alone in feeling the heat drought and starvation afflicted africa on may 19 the people in the town of phalodi lived through the hottest day in the recorded history of india 123 8 degrees fahrenheit el niño has now ended and climate scientists almost universally expect 2017 to be cooler than the year before but the scale of the heat burst has been startling to many of the experts and some of them fear an accelerated era of global warming could be at hand over the next few years even at current temperatures billions of tons of land ice are melting or sliding into the ocean the sea is also absorbing most of the heat trapped by human emissions those factors are causing the ocean to rise at what appears to be an accelerating pace and coastal communities in the united states are beginning to spend billions to fight increased tidal flooding their pleas for help from congress have largely been ignored the finding that a record had been set for the third year in a row was released on wednesday by three government agencies two of them american and one british that track measurements made by ships buoys and weather stations they analyze the figures to correct for known problems producing an annual average temperature for the surface of the earth the national meteorological agency of japan confirmed the findings in a preliminary analysis in the british data set 2016 set a record by only a small amount the margin was larger in the noaa data set and larger still in nasa s nasa does more work than the other groups to take full account of arctic temperatures and several scientists said they believed the nasa record to be the most accurate for 2016 for that reason nasa s calculations suggested that the planet had warmed by well over a fahrenheit from 2013 to 2016 that is a huge change for the surface of an entire planet to undergo in just three years and it appears to be the largest temperature increase over a period in the nasa record which begins in 1880 the findings about a year were also confirmed by the berkeley earth surface temperature project a nonprofit california group set up to provide a temperature analysis independent of governments that group however did not find that three records had been set in a row in its analysis 2010 was slightly warmer than 2014 in addition to the surface measurements satellites are used to measure the temperature of the atmosphere within a few miles of the surface two groups that analyze these figures showed a 2016 in data going back to 1978 though in one data set it was a record by only a small margin since 1880 noaa s records show only one other instance when global temperature records were set three years in a row in 1939 1940 and 1941 the earth has warmed so much in recent decades however that 1941 now ranks as only the year on record the modern era of global warming began around 1970 after a long stretch of relatively flat temperatures and the past three years mark the first time in that period that three records were set in a row of the 17 hottest years on record 16 have now occurred since 2000 two of the agencies that issued wednesday s figures noaa and nasa will soon report to cabinet secretaries appointed by donald j trump who has expressed doubt about the findings of climate science in 2012 mr trump wrote on twitter the concept of global warming was created by and for the chinese in order to make u s manufacturing noncompetitive fear has erupted within the agencies about whether their data will now be subject to political manipulation mr trump and his cabinet nominees have given no detailed indication of what their broad climate policies are likely to be much less how they will manage the scientific enterprise of monitoring the climate since he was elected president mr trump has acknowledged there may be some connectivity between human activity and climate change and he promised to keep an open mind on the subject on wednesday in questioning before the senate environment and public works committee mr trump s nominee to lead the environmental protection agency scott pruitt said i do not believe that climate change is a hoax he did not however say whether he believed that mr trump was wrong on climate change the three years in a row undercut longstanding claims by a handful of contrarian scientists that global warming stopped after 1998 that argument was never backed by good statistical evidence but it was highlighted repeatedly in congress and on the presidential campaign trail in 2016 when the heat buildup in the ocean is taken into account global temperatures are rising relentlessly scientists have calculated that the heat accumulating throughout the earth because of human emissions is roughly equal to the energy that would be released by 400 000 hiroshima atomic bombs exploding across the planet every day it is true that at the earth s surface the warming seems to be proceeding in fits and starts the arc of global warming will be variously steep and less steep said richard seager a climate scientist at the earth observatory of columbia university it never stopped in fact the rate over time has been reasonably close to predictions that scientists first offered decades ago those same scientists have long warned that humanity is courting disaster by failing to bring emissions under control for example many experts on sea level believe that a rise of 15 or 20 feet has already become inevitable though they cannot say how fast it will happen a rise that large would drown most of the world s coastal cities without heroic efforts to fortify them ',\n",

have a parent who loved her unconditionally but those memories are now complicated by an extraordinary drama that has played out over the week since ms manigo 18 found out that she had been spirited away as a newborn from a hospital in jacksonville fla that her real name is kamiyah mobley and that the woman she still thinks of as her mother has been charged with her abduction she is still trying to make sense of it all she met with her birth parents craig aiken and shanara mobley last weekend but in her first newspaper interview since the case made headlines on friday she said she did not have a cross word for gloria williams the woman who now stands accused of lurking for more than a dozen hours around a jacksonville hospital on the july 1998 day ms manigo was born looking for a newborn to snatch i feel like i was blessed ms manigo said in a telephone interview i never had a reason to question a blessing like that someone loving you so much ms manigo said she never had cause to doubt her mother in the rural south carolina community where she grew up but the police say someone else clearly did at least two tips were called in late last year to the jacksonville sheriff s office some 200 miles away where the police still had an open case a woman posing as a health care worker approached a young mother then 16 with a newborn and walked out of what was then university medical center with a baby and disappeared sheriff mike williams recounted at a news conference on friday the woman wore flowered hospital scrubs and carried a purse which seemed odd what s she doing with a pocketbook the baby s grandmother velma aiken recalled thinking in a report on the 10th anniversary of the case that lady could be stealing your baby she thought i m picking up a bad spirit the woman spent hours with the family and then left with the baby saying the girl had a fever and needed some tests they never came back in the 18 years since that child s abduction we have received and followed up on more than 2 500 investigative leads sheriff williams said recalling an intense lengthy detailed multiagency investigation the family reached a legal settlement with the hospital two years later and every year the baby s mother would wrap a slice of birthday cake in tinfoil and freeze it the case also went cold late last year two fresh tips came in and they led detectives to walterboro s c a town of just 5 000 people an hour west of charleston there the investigators found a young woman who had been born on july 10 1998 just like kamiyah but with a different name her documents were fraudulent sheriff williams said and interviews with people supported the idea that the two women were one and the same the detectives asked ms manigo for a dna sample and of course like someone who understands their rights she said what is this about do you have a warrant said her lawyer justin bamberg the investigators returned with one ms manigo gave her dna and in short order found out the truth she was someone else s child conscious of the fact that the woman she knew as her mother will now face trial for kidnapping ms manigo is unwilling to discuss a lot about the case including how her family life finally unraveled she does not want to say which name she plans to use in the future and she insisted that she was never suspicious although the police said otherwise at a news conference on friday i never had any id or a driver s license but other than that everything was totally normal she said she did acknowledge being stymied a few months ago when she applied for work at shoney s but lacked the social security card she needed to get the job she took care of everything i ever needed ms manigo said i never wanted for anything i always trusted her with it she said that ms williams was not mentally ill and that she had not been overprotective ms williams worked at a navy yard handling medical records and was set to receive her master s degree this year she was a very smart woman ms manigo said ms manigo met her biological parents on saturday at a teary reunion followed by a trip to the mall she called them mom and dad because she figured those were words they had been waiting a long time to hear you can tell she has a lot of love for me as well ms manigo said about her biological mother who could not be reached for comment they don t feel like they feel like distant family she said she felt an innate trust toward them her father craig aiken told in jacksonville the meeting was beautiful it s a feeling that you can t explain he said mr bamberg ms manigo s lawyer said there were now practical matters to attend to she needs identification and a social security card a large financial settlement was won on her behalf and now that she is 18 it has to be determined whether any money was set aside for her you have incidents where people s lives were turned upside down and then you have this a life that was essentially erased he said among the few people who can really relate to what ms mobley is experiencing is sarah cecilie finkelstein waters when she was a preschooler living with her mother her father took her and it was not until she was a teenager and saw her picture on a milk carton that she realized that she had been abducted ms waters eventually reconnected with her mother distanced herself from her father and as an adult befriended other survivors of abduction it turns reality upside down and forces you to question every core thing you ever believed to be true said ms waters now 46 married and a mother herself living on long island you have to really struggle to come to terms with all these shades of gray make sense of them and hopefully some sort of peace with them what is reality who is wrong and who s right who really loves me who is telling the truth since ms mobley seems devoted to the woman she believed was her mother ms waters said she needs to feel like she can embrace her new family without giving up on her old one geoffrey greif a professor at the university of maryland school of social work who has studied abduction cases said some psychological effects were common as you connect the dots over a period of time it s a pretty normal reaction to become upset with the abductor and a child who was abducted may have trouble developing intimacy and trust with other people he said we often see a degree of anger at the parents who were left behind even if that s not really justified like why didn t you look harder for me but cases like ms mobley s are quite rare thousands of children are abducted each year but usually the abductor is a family member most often a parent and abduction by a stranger often has a tragic end sexual abuse death or both a spokesman for the hospital which is now called uf health jacksonville said the medical center was thrilled that the young woman had been found we share in the joy of this discovery with her family the northeast florida community and law enforcement as they celebrate this news the spokesman dan leveton said in a statement like most hospitals we currently have specialized security measures in place both and electronic to protect newborns and their mothers ms manigo somehow has taken it all in stride so far and for her mom still means ms williams who is being held at the jacksonville jail without bond when i close

for the oath mr trump s predecessor thomas barrack jr the chairman of mr trump s inaugural committee said in a statement earlier this week that the is humbled to place his hand on bibles that hold special meaning both to his family and to our country mr trump s personal bible was given to him by his mother in 1955 two days before his ninth birthday according to a statement from the inaugural committee he had just completed the sunday church primary school at the first presbyterian church in queens where he grew up to use the lincoln bible the inaugural committee has to borrow it from its permanent home at the library of congress lincoln swore the oath on it at his first inaugural in 1861 as the united states stood on the cusp of the civil war it was not used again at an inauguration until the election of barack obama who was sworn in on it in 2009 and again in 2013 conservationists at the library of congress said the book was ready for another big day though they have wary eyes turned toward a weather forecast that hints at the possibility of rain we always have it in the back of our mind that this might be happening said elmer eusman who is the head of conservation so we re prepared we already had made a protective box for it for obama s inauguration he said adding that the library is creating a mylar wraparound for the cover to protect it from rain mr eusman said the library would also have someone on standby who will be notified immediately if the bible has been damaged and will whisk it back to a conservation lab for immediate repair the steps are mostly precautionary the lincoln bible is in good shape and it can certainly sustain this kind of activity said mark dimunation the head of rare books and special collections the bible was given to the library by mary lincoln the widow of robert todd lincoln the president s son mr dimunation said the collection also included the contents of president lincoln s pocket from the night he was killed we ve used it from time to time in exhibitions and when we talk about lincoln it gives us the opportunity to bring out the bible and talk about the content of the first inaugural address mr dimunation said it does have a certain kind of electricity about it because of the nature of that inaugural event because his election had been so divisive between the election and the inauguration seven states had seceded from the union there was real concern that lincoln would be attacked and so he was smuggled into washington his household effects including his family bible were still being shipped from springfield ill mr dimunation said a clerk for the supreme court william thomas carroll was sent out to buy what became the lincoln bible the book is an 1853 oxford university press printing of the king james bible mr eusman said and it is bound in burgundy velvet with metal trim it is approximately six by four inches and about an inch and a quarter thick it s not very big he said the back holds a large blue paper seal on yellow paper where mr carroll recorded the events of the day it has an accretion of ceremonial use that really gives this object an emotional and historical weight at this point mr dimunation said while the constitution requires presidents to take an oath of office there is no rule requiring them to do so with their hands on a religious book or any book at all most have used a family bible the bible used by george washington at the first inauguration has been popular with his successors warren g harding dwight d eisenhower jimmy carter and george h w bush all used it and in 2001 george w bush had made preparations to be the sixth president to do so members of the new york masonic temple that cares for the bible carried it to the capitol but rain intervened mr bush used his father s family bible instead in 1825 john quincy adams was sworn in on a law book according to the joint congressional committee on inaugural ceremonies adams was also according to the

       " 'whether or not you eat what mcdonald s serves let s at least agree the giant has a knack for putting together unexpected ingredients in a way that no one had seen before the same could be said about the founder the biographical film about ray a kroc played by michael keaton the onetime salesman who helped transform mcdonald s from a roadside stand in san bernardino calif to an empire of golden arches the movie in wide release jan 20 also stars nick offerman and john carroll lynch as richard and maurice mcdonald the brothers known as dick and mac who created the namesake restaurants and invented the system then entered into an uneasy partnership with kroc who took over the company if kroc is the engine of the founder then the mcdonald brothers are its heart the loyal siblings whose ingenuity and traditional values are eventually overwhelmed by their new partner s relentless hustle the characters also represent a rare pairing for mr offerman a star of parks and recreation and mr lynch whose films include fargo zodiac and jackie two steadily working sturdily built actors known for quirky distinctive roles outdoorsmen lawyers presidents mass murderers that stick in your memory yet who had never acted together before mr offerman and mr lynch spoke recently by phone about family relationships onscreen and off and shared their innermost thoughts about the mcdonald s menu these are edited excerpts from the conversation you each own a very particular piece of turf in your individual careers did you ever cross paths in the industry before nick offerman thank you for accusing us of offering unique and individual work john carroll lynch or having a place in this industry i think we met the night before we started working offerman there had been a couple of indie movies where i almost got cast in a thing or two that you were working in and then they found out i had not worked at the guthrie theater and they moved on lynch you ll be happy to know that i read for ron swanson on parks and recreation i don t think we ever talked about that offerman oh no lynch absolutely yes that s true i read for ron swanson and they wisely chose nick offerman it must have been a height issue that s the only thing i can think of was there any time to develop your familial bond before you started playing the brothers lynch we had one day of rehearsal there were a couple of things that nick and i were given for biographical background there were recordings of dick mcdonald dictaphone audio memos to the company to listen to his voice and the way he regarded his brother i remember hearing such great love and esteem in his voice also the first day of our shoot was the day they tell the story of their long rise to success it was a lot of fun and set the groundwork for the remainder of the work offerman in the scene he s talking about john had several minutes of exposition monologue that was the first thing we shot in this restaurant with michael keaton john rattled the entire piece with enthusiasm and absolute vim and vigor he finished the take and everybody s jaw dropped and keaton was like well all right moving on did you ever work in the industry lynch i never worked at mcdonald s but i worked at burger king for a couple of minutes i was at a waiter at a pub near the catholic university of america where i went to college i waited on ed herrmann the actor once i screwed up his order he didn t want the ribs i also worked at the boston sea party in denver where he was raised shucking oysters i d never seen an oyster let alone knew how to shuck one after a series of shifts i was like i ve got to get a job at just to heal my hands offerman when i d just gotten my driver s license a friend of mine was a manager at a hardee s in joliet and i wanted to buy a used car for about 1 500 so i started working some shifts for her flipping burgers and i had just about amassed the sum that i desired when i got in a vehicular disagreement with an older lady at an intersection the long and the short of which is i was at fault and it cost me 1 500 i took that as a lesson that a career in was not for me what role did mcdonald s play in your lives growing up offerman when i was a kid we d go to swimming lessons on saturday in the other big town morris ill and as a reward for not perishing we would be taken to mcdonald s where we were allowed to purchase a sandwich that was the filet mignon of my youth more important we were crazy about the packaging because all of our star wars action figures fit neatly in the hash browns cardboard sleeve and you could make all kinds of vehicles out of those clamshell boxes lynch i had a mcdonald s at the end of my paper route when i was a kid i was young enough that my mother would say what kind of coke would you like and i would say orange because all sodas were coke over the course of my childhood it stopped being just hamburgers and cheeseburgers and they introduced things like the and the big mac i remember when the big mac came out it was a big deal for me offerman i forgot about that in my youth when they would release a new sandwich like the big mac it was like the new iphone lynch there were certainly times when there would be as much discussion in my elementary school class as anybody standing at an apple store today offerman let me get this straight there s a bun in the middle of the other bun get out of here isn t that a special piece of bread lynch i like the fact that you call it special i would call it utterly useless other than for its stated purpose which is to have enough special sauce on it to literally cause a heart attack offerman it s a propagandist s master stroke it literally says this sandwich is so monumental we had to add an extra level of bread lynch it becomes a sandwich before they just had sandwiches then there were two having now played these characters can you ever look at mcdonald s or fast food the same way again lynch i see how the mcdonald brothers transformed for good or for ill how america eats and frankly how the world eats it was in some ways more transforming to our bodies than the model a i think that s both a triumph and a bit chilling that transforms american capitalism from personal success based on hard work and quality of work to inventive dominant business models when the mcdonald brothers were developing the way to get you your sandwich in 30 seconds and not 30 minutes they didn t foresee that it would take the place of the family dinner every day it has ramifications around my own midsection that i didn t see coming offerman i m a big fan of the writing of people like eric schlosser and michael pollan so i was very much on board with the exposing of this worldwide system in which we re pretty much all complicit it s emblematic of how we ve grown disconnected from where our food comes from who makes and grows our food it s all related it allows us to elect people to office that perhaps don t have the healthiest ingredients perhaps they have an extra bun that is inexplicable is it difficult after playing such close brothers to part company and go your separate ways offerman every acting job is sort of like a family reunion sometimes you work with an actor and you think oh yes you are one of the drunks in the family or you re passive aggressive or you re just crazy you make a mental note at future family reunions to steer clear of that one but then there are family members where you say oh we ve got something similar we re terrific on the volleyball court together so every time there s a rumor of volleyball happening i m going to hope that john carroll lynch shows up and i will do my best to set up his sweet spike move lynch there was an opportunity that nick and i might work together again that became not possible i know i will look for another opportunity at any time to work with him offerman i don t feel the same lynch that s why i m just going to chase you man it s just going to be a stalker situation i ve got my goggles i m sitting on a tree right now just waiting for darkness ',\n",

floated like elton john and charlotte church only to have the artists publicly rebuke the invitation but when it all finally came together a beaming mr trump stood at the foot of the lincoln memorial

the inner cities that includes everybody just hours before he was to be sworn in mr trump still recalled grievances from the campaign the polls started going up up up but they didn t want to give us credit he said but he also turned his attention to the future promising to work hard and saying he was looking forward to friday a tableau of trumps including the incoming first lady melania trump mr

thursday night he greeted honored guests to jared kushner his and adviser he said if you can t produce peace in the middle east nobody can to his white house chief of staff reince priebus he commented nobody knew how to pronounce his name it s a crazy name the added reince was taking tremendous abuse because he went through hell then it was on to his campaign in 2020 the next time four years from now the next time we re going to win the way we re going to win because we did so well because it was so overwhelming the thing that we did because it was so beautiful on that last point it was not clear how he was implying he won in 2016 russian interference losing the popular tally by nearly three million votes as for inauguration day mr trump saw a silver lining in the forecast rain if it really pours tomorrow that s o k he said because people will realize it s my real hair the inaugural kickoff celebration on the national mall had been a subdued affair without protests but at least one of the inaugural balls organized by mr trump s supporters has drawn protesters the deploraball a cocktail party organized by supporters of mr trump and held at the national press club drew several hundred protesters crowded into a city block chanting and waving signs denouncing the incoming trump administration sarko sarkodie a washington resident was part of the crowd i m just part of the resistance efforts that have been happening this week ms sarkodie said and they ll be happening over the next four years trump supporters seemed to be staying away from the event but several people watched the scene from inside a nearby bar where a man wearing a trump flag and trump sweatpants could be seen embracing friends that s a brave dude right there a bystander said of the man several people wandered through the area in gowns seemingly dismayed when they turned the corner to encounter the protests but perennial presidential candidate and kid favorite vermin supreme made it to the show at the smithsonian s national museum of african american history and culture a throng of people in ball gowns dashikis tuxedos and silk headscarves flocked to the peace ball voices of hope and resistance i guess i was just looking for something to put my energy into and to give obama a really good said pavy bacon a maryland resident about why she bought a ticket to the ball if you really appreciate what obama has done you can t help but be fearful of the next administration the event which was in the works before election day was not envisioned as an affair anas andy shallal an artist and activist who owns the popular d c bookstore cafe chain busboys and poets dreamed up the party as the ultimate celebration of the progress made under president obama but as inauguration day drew closer peace ball became a place for liberals to converge and comfort themselves john osborne a lawyer from washington d c perused the exhibits with his wife and said he came because on the eve of the inauguration he wanted to surround himself with people from all races religions and backgrounds i wanted to be in a place that reflects the america that i see and live everyday he said i m hopeful that our country will remain that way expected guests included the actor danny glover the artist solange knowles grammy winning jazz musician esperanza spalding the author alice walker and cnn pundit van jones before the official festivities began mr trump appeared at a luncheon with supporters at the trump international hotel where he praised the collective i q of his cabinet members we have by far the highest i q of any cabinet ever assembled mr trump said in the remarks which reporters heard only the first several minutes of before being escorted out of course he put himself into the high i q category when he boasted this is a gorgeous room a total genius must have built this place as an aside it is impossible to do the math but president obama s starters did include a nobel laureate in physics at the energy department a former president of harvard heading the national economic council and the president of the new york federal reserve bank as treasury secretary mr trump also singled out specific supporters including woody johnson the owner of the new york jets football team and his pick for treasury secretary steven mnuchin mr mnuchin mr trump noted wasn t at the lunch because he was being grilled at his senate confirmation hearing several blocks away mr trump also faulted senators for not being nice to representative tom price of georgia his pick to be the health and human services secretary and speaking of mr johnson the jets owner is expected to get one of the plum jobs in diplomacy the united states ambassador to britain or as the brits call it ambassador of the united states to the court of st james s mr johnson is only the fourth ambassador to be announced by mr trump after nikki haley as ambassador to the united nations david friedman his longtime attorney as ambassador to israel and iowa gov terry branstad as ambassador to china given that both mr trump and his british counterpart prime minister theresa may are relatively new in their roles mr johnson s ability to get mr trump on the phone quickly could be helpful at this year the jets weren t the best the and vice laid a wreath at the tomb of the unknowns at arlington national cemetery then it was on to the lincoln memorial for the concert that opens the inaugural festivities eric huppert the leader of defenders of liberty motorcycle club and local organizer of bikers for trump stood beside a row of hulking harley davidsons and said he was not looking for violence sure chris cox the founder of bikers for trump had pledged that his members would act as a wall of meat to block protesters but mr huppert downplayed all that i don t anticipate any skirmishes at least i hope not he said but if the safety of mr trump s supporters or even the himself is jeopardized he added i think these folks will be willing to jump in if necessary a security force beholden to no one with no rules of engagement and no real marching orders is well not a great idea but bikers for trump stand by their man david nichols traveled from texarkana tex with seven others to attend the bikers for trump rally on inauguration day the group drove for 22 hours straight towing eight bikes on a trailer he ll be a fine president he just has to calm down his words mr nichols said just don t bash people s name too much a day before mr trump is to be sworn in as the 45th president of the united states he took to twitter to assert that he is not responsible for the nation s divisions his champion the rev franklin graham to some mr graham s good wishes may not hold much weight last month on

       " 'washington steven t mnuchin donald j trump s pick to be treasury secretary failed to disclose nearly 100 million of his assets on senate finance committee disclosure documents and forgot to mention his role as a director of an investment fund located in a tax haven an omission that democrats said made him unfit to serve in one of the government s most important positions the revelation came hours before mr mnuchin a former goldman sachs banker began testifying on thursday before the senate finance committee which has historically been bipartisan in its demands for transparency from nominees mr mnuchin was ready to outline his vision for the economy and defend himself against claims that he headed a bank that ran a foreclosure machine during the financial crisis the treasury secretary ought to be somebody who works on behalf of all americans including those who are still waiting for the economic recovery to show up in their communities said senator ron wyden the ranking democrat on the committee when i look at mr mnuchin s background it s a stretch to find evidence he d be that kind of treasury secretary in a hearing marked by sharp exchanges mr mnuchin struggled to answer questions about his use of tax havens as a hedge fund manager and whether he thought such loopholes should be closed senator debbie stabenow democrat of michigan pointedly asked mr mnuchin if he was using cayman islands corporations to avoid taxation he responded that he was working on behalf of his clients in accordance with the law let me just be clear again i did not use a cayman islands entity in any way to avoid paying taxes for myself mr mnuchin said i would love to work with the i r s to close these tax issues that make no sense he added i would support changing the tax laws to make sure they are simpler and more effective republicans came to mr mnuchin s defense suggesting that none of his omissions were willful and they gave strong indications that they would vote for him senator orrin g hatch republican of utah defended mr mnuchin s business record and described him as extremely qualified for the job objectively speaking i don t believe anyone can reasonably argue that mr mnuchin is unqualified for the position mr hatch said if the confirmation process focused mainly on the question of a nominee s qualifications there would be little if any opposition to mr mnuchin s nomination but the process was also focused on mr mnuchin s financial disclosure form and that prompted intense scrutiny in his revised questionnaire mr mnuchin disclosed several additional financial assets including 95 million worth of real estate a in new york city a residence in southampton new york a residence in los angeles california and 15 million in real estate holdings in mexico democratic staff members of the senate finance committee wrote in a memo on thursday mr mnuchin has claimed these omissions were due to a misunderstanding of the questionnaire according to the memo mr mnuchin also initially failed to disclose that he is the director of dune capital international an investment fund incorporated in the cayman islands along with management posts in seven other investment funds and he belatedly disclosed that his children own nearly 1 million in artwork asked about the omissions at the hearing mr mnuchin described them as a simple mistake made amid a mountain of bureaucracy i think as you all can appreciate filling out these government forms is quite complicated mr mnuchin said noting that he had handed over 5 000 pages of disclosures let me first say any oversight it was unintentional but democrats pounced and tied mr mnuchin to mr trump s campaign pledge to drain the swamp in washington pressed as to whether his failure to disclose the information was an ethical lapse mr mnuchin insisted that he was following the guidance of his lawyers and made an innocent error i assure you that these forms were very complicated he said explaining that he had pledged to be forthcoming to the best of my knowledge senator robert menendez democrat of new jersey was unsatisfied with the response and shot back it doesn t take a rocket scientist to understand the words list all positions to that senator chuck schumer of new york the democratic leader added never before has the senate considered such an ethically challenged slate of nominees for key cabinet positions mr mnuchin s failure to disclose his cayman islands holdings just reeks of the swamp that the promised to drain on the campaign trail and american bridge the democratic super pac said mr mnuchin s holdings were a sign that mr trump s government would not look out for working class americans by slamming through mnuchin senate republicans are becoming accessories to trump s future corruption helping him stack his cabinet with shady billionaires who like trump will rig the government to serve their own interests at the expense of the

kim shourds and susan perkins lovelady drove in from norfolk va to attend the evening s concerts they danced and sang along to god blessed texas but as they took a break they said the volatile

not fazed by the lack of entertainers i think if they don t want to perform they shouldn t perform mr dunham 60 said but at the same time my understanding is they weren t asked to toby keith is going to perform lee greenwood is going to perform some of the loudest cheers of the evening were for jon voight the only hollywood actor to lend his name to the event as he spoke to the crowd about the barrage of propaganda that mr trump had faced in his race to the presidency he certainly didn t need this job mr voight said of mr trump and yes god answered all of our prayers mr voight then

group featuring a cellist and pianist that is known for its eclectic covers of pop songs however it was mr keith the country star and the night s biggest draw who brought the national mall roaring back to life there has never been a president crossing over so directly from the world as mr trump who remains an executive producer of the celebrity apprentice and has cultivated big names in hollywood for decades even making a home alone 2 cameo yet those big names are shunning his inauguration including thursday s event unlike the lincoln memorial concert in 2009 for president obama that featured beyoncé and other stars the artists who are showing up are reflective of the of the united states that buoyed mr trump to victory in november while belying the opulence he is known for standing by the memorial s reflecting pool a few hours before the show john stephan a retired banker said he left california on tuesday to be part of the festivities and snagged a ticket to the concert at the last minute as for the various entertainers who had snubbed the concert or even said yes and then backpedaled mr stephan was dismissive i think it s sad when anybody says you know my opinion of a person s more important than let s just get the country going he said lines to get into the show began forming in the morning about 5 000 tickets were available and the crowd steadily filled the empty spots near the memorial and on the mall by the start of the show along the streets leading to the memorial people pulled wagons full of homemade trump merchandise including make

administration i didn t vote for him but i had hope mr trump s campaign as some of his supporters see it was never about fitting in with the hollywood crowd thursday s lineup suited them just fine

       " 'pity the poor billionaires who are about to take the oath of office for them everything is going to change in winning the presidency donald j trump proposed a grand hypothesis that the federal government can be managed like a business if we could run our country the way i ve run my company we would have a country that you would be so proud of he told voters in the final presidential debate it s a theory that has been suggested to various degrees by almost every president in the last century from calvin coolidge to barack obama what s different this time is the vigorousness of the experiment with his inauguration on friday and a cabinet that is likely to include three billionaires five former chief executives and some of the business world s most accomplished leaders mr trump is poised to test perhaps once and for all if good governance and crafty deal making are really similar skills but as anyone who has spent time in a laboratory can attest experiments are messy separating the signals from the noise takes diligence and in this case so much will depend on the savviness of those woeful billionaires who had it so good and now will be guinea pigs thrust into a maze that has overwhelmed so many test subjects before them running an agency is very very different from running a company said carlos m gutierrez who was commerce secretary under george w bush after serving as chief executive of kellogg s some of the skills do transfer but you have to be careful figuring out which ones in government you can t fire anyone your board of directors is 535 people in congress and half of them want to see you fail one of the first challenges will be figuring out what business leadership means when so many of capitalism s tools firing misbehaving employees giving raises to those who overperform aren t allowed by federal rules c e o s who come in saying i m going to show everyone how it s done are the ones most likely to fail mr gutierrez said one problem has always been that while the business world rewards leaders for an intense focus on a singular goal maximizing profits as efficiently as possible government yearns for the opposite pleasing the largest number of people with methods that offend the fewest and while competition is usually a good thing within business inside government it s often more corrosive as the partisanship of the past decade demonstrates you succeed in washington by collaborating said henry m paulson jr who was widely lauded as treasury secretary for mr bush and before that as chief executive of goldman sachs businesspeople tend to see competition as a means to find the best solutions a sorting device that pushes the smartest ideas ahead but many of the trickiest government issues like immigration or tax reform involve dozens of agencies as well as lawmakers and lobbyists who must be persuaded to cooperate intelligence in government is almost always a humble group activity you can t just think about your own agency or your own goals mr paulson said you have to please both sides of the aisle while making sure you re not outshining other officials and persuading employees who don t have to obey your orders and you have to adjust to having a boss the president instead of being the boss it takes a lot of humility some of mr trump s picks might have an easier time making the transition than others rex w tillerson the former chief executive of exxon mobil and the choice for secretary of state is among the nominees who have spent their careers involved in the operations of complicated firms that span continents tillerson has basically been a politician for the last 20 years he s just been doing it for the nation of exxon said paul h o neill who became treasury secretary during mr bush s first term after leading the aluminum company alcoa he s negotiated with foreign governments he s had more than 80 000 employees you don t run a company that size by telling people what to do you learn how to persuade them to follow your vision to accommodate all kinds of different agendas and personalities other cabinet secretaries have spent their careers mostly as investors not as direct managers hedge fund and private equity professionals like steven t mnuchin likely to be the next treasury secretary betsy devos who has been tapped as education secretary and wilbur l ross the expected commerce secretary have largely devoted their lives to buying and selling companies and so there are questions about how well they will make the shift to jobs that demand a focus on the smallest details of governance mr ross whose confirmation hearing was held on wednesday presents a fascinating test subject as an acquirer of steel mills coal mines and other heavy industries he has amassed a personal fortune worth billions over the years i ve had businesses that actually operated in some 23 countries mr ross said at the hearing we have been on the ground in all of the major trading partners of this country usually when mr ross buys a new company he follows a pretty successful script he shows up says a few words and then hands operations to professional managers who know how to run things and who know he will fire them if they fail however when mr ross takes the oath of office that script will change he will be whisked off to the executive wing of the commerce department and walked past long rows of barren offices the furniture of political appointees is removed during each presidential transition and spoiler alert it often takes weeks for new desks and bookcases to arrive if he can find enough chairs he might call a meeting of the few employees milling around his deputies and key department heads need senatorial approval which might take a few months he will be handed dozens of binders explaining how his department does everything from monitor weather satellites to administer patents and admonished to study up congress loves humiliating cabinet members who haven t done their homework and explaining that you are an excellent delegator alas fails to impress on capitol hill if mr ross hopes to fly to one of the department s satellite offices he will have to decide if he wants to complete the reams of paperwork needed to use his own jet or go coach as secretaries in previous administrations were encouraged perception matters a lot in washington said karen g mills who always flew in the cheap seats as administrator of the small business administration after a career in finance left her with more than 40 million i did however try to avoid the middle seat if mr ross is lucky by the end of his first day someone will have shown him where the bathrooms are there s a risk however that the agency s permanent staff s no 1 goal will be to find ways to sabotage each new cabinet secretary as soon as they walk through the door said newt gingrich a former house speaker who was a campaign adviser to mr trump all those bureaucrats overwhelmingly voted for clinton there won t be any real cooperation until we change federal law so we can fire them worst of all though is that at the end of his tenure no matter how hard mr ross works or how much he sacrifices a large part of his success as well as that of the other secretaries and this experiment as a whole will be outside his control ultimately the most important variable in testing this hypothesis will be mr trump himself what kind of management style will he adopt will he be an operator or a delegator will he change as president or simply relocate and remain c e o in chief how a president behaves filters into the cabinet and senior officials no matter how talented or powerful they once were become an appendage of their new boss a hard demotion for any former master of the universe if mr trump can t manage the presidency then no one working for him is likely to succeed and vice versa so as this experiment unfolds before a captivated nation pity mr ross and all the poor billionaires they are sacrificing themselves so that all of us might learn and in case they are wondering the bathrooms are down the hall and around the corner you re responsible for replacing the toilet paper if you ve used the last of the roll ',\n",
       " 'washington out with almonds in with doritos at the stroke of 12 01 p m on friday as soon as donald j trump is sworn in as president and barack obama relinquishes the office dozens of federal workers will swing into action at the white house to replace one commander in chief s creature comforts favorite snacks clothes toiletries artwork and furniture with those of his successor the process months in the planning but mere hours in its militarylike execution unfolds mostly away from public view as americans and the world focus on the pageantry of inauguration day the presidential oath and address at the capitol a parade down pennsylvania avenue the balls for the roughly 100 people who work in the white house and the employees on hand to help them with perhaps the world s moving day the official events double as useful distractions that keep the exiting president and his family and the incoming occupants during the work it s very busy you are on your feet constantly making sure things are going in the right place and in the right way and there is very little time to spare said betty monkman a white house curator for more than three decades who helped supervise the changeover in 2001 when bill clinton was moving out and george w bush was coming in the housekeeper and maids are all getting the clothes in the closet and cosmetics and toiletries in the bathrooms the kitchen staff is preparing the food there is a lot going on mr obama and his wife michelle who plan to move to a house less than two miles from the white house so they can remain in washington while their younger daughter sasha completes high school have already begun moving personal items to their new home moving trucks including one from a company specializing in storing and moving fine art have been parked outside the house in the district s upscale kalorama neighborhood and workers have been photographed carrying large cartons inside but much of the work at the white house cannot take place until the transfer of power occurs just after noon when two moving trucks pull into the driveway that circles the south lawn one to deliver the new president s possessions and the other one to cart off those belonging to the departing chief executive nostalgia mixes in with the frenzy it s an emotional time said anita mcbride who served as chief of staff to laura bush including during the 2009 handoff to the obamas on the morning of the inauguration before the departing president hosts his successor for a midmorning tea members of the white house residence staff butlers maids cooks groundskeepers and others typically gather in the east room to say goodbye to the couple they have served often for the better part of a decade it can be teary ms mcbride said the changes range from the mundane to the significant mr obama whose family s obsession with healthy eating has been well documented keeps a large bowl of apples on a table in the oval office and a supply of almonds for his nibbling over briefing books mr trump a aficionado is known to prefer not only doritos but also lays potato chips the chief usher is in charge of briefing the kitchen staff of any such requests in advance so the pantry on the ground floor of the white house can be appropriately stocked mr trump s team declined to comment on what requests he has made for stocking the kitchen or redecorating the house for his first days there and it is not clear how much time the incoming president who is most comfortable in the familiar confines of his lavish penthouse apartment at trump tower with its accents plans to spend there his wife melania who met jan 3 at the white house with the usher and curator plans to live in new york for the first months of mr trump s presidency so the couple s elementary son barron can finish the year at his private school in manhattan the white house empties of all but a skeleton crew of political appointees during the inauguration on capitol hill amy zantzinger a social secretary for ms bush recalls walking out the white house gate just before noon on that day in 2009 as michael smith the obamas decorator was coming in mrs obama s priority that day was getting the girls rooms settled in time for bedtime that night ms zantzinger said about the first daughters then 7 and 10 a transition official close to mrs trump speaking on the condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to talk about the process said she was working closely with an interior designer to redo parts of the white house residence the official also would not address reports that mrs trump a former model would install a glam room for makeup and hair preparations she has enlisted jessica boulanger a senior vice president of communications at the business roundtable who has an interest in fashion design on a volunteer basis to help her establish an east wing team mr trump is planning to swap the curtains in the oval office currently a deep shade of red for those used by a previous president according to a person familiar with the exchange at the white house aides have been plotting the move for weeks they compiled briefing books for the incoming first family with color photographs and architectural drawings of all the rooms in the residence including what furniture and artwork are available curators who keep computerized inventories of artifacts that are in the permanent collection of the white house and those that have been brought in as gifts or personal items police the process to ensure that exiting presidents do not leave with anything that does not belong to them it does not always go seamlessly bill and hillary clinton had to return nearly 50 000 worth of gifts they took with them when they left the white house in 2001 these were eventually determined to be the property of the national park service which oversees the white house the clintons were partying up until 3 a m the night before so it was much more of a frantic turnaround for the residence staff to move in the bushes stuff ms mcbride said when it came time for mrs bush a librarian to transition out of the white house she added she made sure the process was orderly starting in the summer of 2008 when she began gradually moving belongings to the family s ranch in crawford tex the newly president and first lady typically return to the white house after a lunch at the capitol and are greeted by the chief usher who makes sure they are comfortable for a few moments before they head out again to a viewing stand on pennsylvania avenue to watch the inaugural parade they ll come and go quickly which is just as well ms monkman said because there is still so much to do ',\n",
       " 'washington rick perry the former texas governor and donald j trump s nominee as energy secretary said in his senate confirmation hearing on thursday that he regretted having recommended the abolition of the energy department in the past he addressed his awkward history on the issue up front telling the senate energy and natural resources committee that after being briefed on so many of the vital functions of the department of energy he no longer believed as he said while running for president in 2011 that it should be eliminated mr perry also offered a reversal of his views on the science of climate change which he called a contrived phony mess in a 2010 book i believe the climate is changing he said i believe some of it is naturally occurring but some of it is also caused by activity the question is how do we address it in a thoughtful way that doesn t compromise economic growth the affordability of energy or american jobs mr trump by contrast has called climate change a hoax and has continued to express doubts about established climate science mr perry also appeared to signal a somewhat different position from mr trump on nuclear weapons policy the energy department s chief portfolio mr trump has said the united states must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability let it be an arms race he said but mr perry asked by senator bernie sanders the vermont independent whether he believed expanded testing of nuclear weapons was a dangerous idea replied i think anyone would be of the opinion that if we never have to test another nuclear weapon that would be a good thing for the world he added i think nonproliferation is a good thing asked if he would support the iran nuclear deal which mr trump has derided and which was largely negotiated by the current energy secretary ernest j moniz mr perry said he had not received classified briefings on it if d o e has a role to make sure that iranians are living up to the deal message delivered sir mr perry said to senator al franken democrat of minnesota last month when mr trump offered mr perry the job of energy secretary he accepted with the understanding that the role would be largely focused on promoting american energy development according to people who have briefed him only later did he learn that the agency s central portfolio is the oversight and management of the nation s nuclear weapons complex as well as 17 national scientific laboratories this confirmation process has been extremely informative and beneficial for me mr perry said citing his conversations with mr moniz a nuclear physicist he highlighted his experience as an air force pilot from 1972 to 1977 as among his qualifications to oversee the nuclear weapons complex mr perry is expected to be easily confirmed by the full senate but democrats pressed him sharply on his views on climate science noting that the energy department is a major science agency with thousands of research scientists across the country democrats expressed concern that his past views so at odds with established mainstream science could be a serious impediment they also pressed him on reports that mr trump s team is considering making cuts to the energy department s offices of energy efficiency renewable energy and fossil energy the last is focused on research to lower carbon emissions mr perry said he was unaware of such reports maybe they ll have the same experience i had and forget that they said that he said to laughter referring to the moment in a 2011 presidential debate when asked which agencies he wanted to eliminate he could not recall the name of the energy department what mr perry later called his oops moment was widely seen as sinking his campaign senator maria cantwell of washington the panel s top democrat said like many of my colleagues i am deeply concerned by some of the things that governor perry has said in the past about climate science she added the department of energy s scientific horsepower is key to understanding these trends i hope you can understand there is widespread anxiety about trump s intention to dismantle these scientific capabilities or simply just starve them for resources ms cantwell pushed mr perry on whether he would protect the agency s budget for climate science i m going to protect all the science whether it s related to climate and all other aspects of what we are doing he replied ms cantwell also asked mr perry about a questionnaire sent to energy department employees by mr trump s transition team that appeared to target the agency s climate science research mr perry disavowed the questionnaire saying it was sent out before he was selected as the nominee i didn t approve it i don t approve it i didn t need the information i don t want that information he said that s not how i manage the hearing was leavened with some humor asked by mr franken who had earlier pushed him sharply on nuclear weapons and climate change in his senate office did you enjoy meeting me mr perry responded i hope you are as much fun on the dais as you were on your couch before adding may i rephrase that sir please please mr franken replied oh my lord oh my lord well i think we ve found our saturday night live sound bite mr perry said ',\n",
       " 'washington in the final weeks of the obama administration the justice department won the first case involving a transgender victim and sued two cities for blocking mosques from opening prosecutors settled charges with two banks then sued a third they filed legal briefs on behalf of new york teenagers being held in solitary confinement and accused louisiana of forcing mentally ill patients into nursing homes and then with days remaining prosecutors announced a deal to overhaul baltimore s police department and accused chicago of unconstitutional police abuses the moves capped a historic and sometimes controversial span in which the justice department pushed the frontiers of civil rights laws inserting itself into private lawsuits and siding with transgender students juvenile prisoners the homeless the blind and people who videotape police officers on issues of gay rights policing criminal justice voting and more government lawyers argued for a broad interpretation of civil rights laws a view that they consistently said would put them on the right side of history few areas of federal policy are likely to change so definitively donald trump s nominee to be attorney general senator jeff sessions of alabama opposes not only the justice department s specific policies on civil rights but its entire approach while liberal democrats have criticized mr sessions s views on specific issues like gay marriage and voting the larger difference is how differently the trump administration will view the government s role in those areas vanita gupta the head of the civil rights division and the face of the obama administration s efforts over the past two years has spoken about the power to bend the arc of history itself not merely by serving your clients but by harnessing the law as a force for positive change the project of civil rights has always demanded creativity she said in an interview it requires being bold often that means going against the grain of popular thinking or it requires going to the more expansive reading of the law to ensure we are actually ensuring equal protection for everyone mr sessions a former federal prosecutor has spoken harshly about lawyers and judges who try to push the law in certain directions a postmodern philosophy that elevates outcomes over law he has called it congress makes laws he has said and he was outraged when eric h holder jr the former attorney general refused to defend a law banning gay marriage and told his state counterparts that they could ethically do the same regarding state bans it was shameful and disgraceful and an abandonment of the rule of law mr sessions said in 2015 i m not happy about what s happened to my department of justice at this confirmation hearing mr sessions harkened to the era of segregation in arguing that there was no need for the federal government to become involved in prosecuting crimes against women or gay people that were already being prosecuted locally i am not sure women or people with different sexual orientations face that kind of discrimination i just don t see it mr sessions said denying that he was or the obama administration saw its mandate much more broadly one of the clearest examples of this philosophy came last year when ms gupta wrote a letter to every public school district in the country and told them to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms that matched their gender identity the policy touched off a furious debate and became a touchstone for conservatives who saw the obama administration as out of touch and making its own laws courts have not settled the question of whether the federal laws apply in matters of gender identity but justice department lawyers who were fielding questions from school officials interpreted those protections broadly congress created the civil rights division as part of the civil rights act of 1957 and its mission and leadership have been the subject of frequent debate president reagan s civil rights chief william bradford reynolds faced criticism from advocacy groups who said he refused to enforce civil rights laws president clinton s choice to lead the division bill lann lee served his tenure in an acting capacity after the senate refused to confirm him largely over his support for affirmative action one of mr obama s nominees debo p adegbile was rejected by the senate over his prior representation of a man convicted of killing a philadelphia police officer in response mr obama never nominated ms gupta to the post like mr lee she has served her tenure in an acting capacity she started work amid unrest in ferguson mo where angry and sometimes violent demonstrators protested the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager and the way police officers treated african americans history simmers beneath the surface in more communities than just ferguson mr holder said at the time as he cast the justice department as a voice for those who have felt abused and ignored for years the justice department ultimately cleared the officer involved in the shooting but sued the city accusing its officers of longstanding abuses of force in encounters with black residents ferguson was the most target of the department s campaign to use civil rights laws to force changes in police policy congress gave the justice department that authority in 1994 after the police beating of rodney king in los angeles but no administration has used that power nearly as aggressively the obama administration has opened two dozen such investigations and sued cities to make policing changes police groups have criticized the administration s approach james o pasco jr executive director of the national fraternal order of police said officers were particularly concerned with the administration s early talk tom perez mr obama s first civil rights chief declared his division was once again open for business and promised more investigations into police departments during his entire tenure there we were never reached out to once not once mr pasco said he went out of his way to make police officers the villains mr pasco has said collaboration with officers has since improved and spoke glowingly of ms gupta but many officers still say the justice department has portrayed them unfairly and mr sessions shares that belief these lawsuits undermine the respect for police officers and create an impression that the entire department is not doing their work consistent with fidelity to law and fairness mr sessions said at his confirmation hearing he said civil rights lawsuits hurt morale and changed the way citizens viewed the police and we need to be careful before we do that in 2015 mr sessions sharply questioned ms gupta about her views on policing and her a c l u advocacy you come from a background that indicates an aggressiveness in these areas he said ms gupta said such questions reflect a double standard i don t think the same comment gets made of criminal prosecutors who ve obtained a lot of convictions she said in an interview that they re too aggressive to do their jobs effectively she added i was an aggressive civil rights chief and i m proud of that ms gupta will leave government with the administration but a team of career lawyers remains many view mr sessions nomination warily but senior officials have urged an open mind ms gupta said she hopes her successor will have one too this is not abstract work done for its own sake she said it is fundamentally about the people whose rights we protect ',\n",

she sold her house in cambridge and quit nursing to focus on an invention that involves beverages i was living in my camper in framingham in my friend s yard she says they were liberal stuff was happening san bernardino paris i d think i don t know if i agree with them when mr trump announced his candidacy in 2015 she felt no sudden spark she says but his message steadily seeped in like a realization about herself and her beliefs one she had always had but had never really considered people were lying down everywhere she says recalling protests about police violence they were lying down in harvard square they were lying down on route 93 they blocked traffic for three hours is a really congested road you want to pull your hair out anyway to shut it down what the hell is going on

allegiance every day that was important i started to pay attention not to what he was saying but to the effect that he had the freedom of speech things he said outrageous things but so what people

his daughters he keeps going he says he believes in this country dianna stops agreeing do you believe he believes in this country i ask her no she replies i don t believe that i ask her why for all these years people said all this stuff about him and i didn t believe them she said but he has done so much to harm america he basically tried to be robin hood his trade policies his willingness to try to take away from people who had more and give to those who had less the middle class shrunk more people ended up at the bottom that was as the result of him obamacare was a big part of this look

friends would attack him now she is glad to see him go part of that is because of policing the first thing he said that struck me was when he said the cambridge police acted stupidly she said referring to mr obama s remark about the arrest of henry louis gates jr a black harvard professor in 2009 as mr gates tried to enter his own home when that comment came out something in my head went huh then he said trayvon martin could have been my son maybe that s what he s thinking but when he says something like that as a leader people listen i had this like what i was confused by that what are you doing she added things have changed in terms of the criminality people will do anything they are going up to cops and executing them people are blowing themselves up they are ramming trucks into things if you alienate the police then we are going to have no law and order on mr obama she said when you are the leader there are times when you have to bite your tongue she added i feel the

since stopped they have latin american employees now another client who recently sold a company for millions said he wanted to cut scott s rate to 20 an hour from 30 and asked him if he could learn spanish to manage a work crew fundamentally it s not fair he says i m working seven days a week now so i can carry myself through the winter they say republicans want the cheaper labor and democrats want the votes but i think they both want cheaper labor people with money just want cheaper labor he says he does not blame the laborers but is angry with politicians who talk as if it were not a problem if i was a poor person south of the border i d probably do the same thing he says scott 58 who lives in beverly mass has led rafting trips in texas on the rio grande for years in 2010 he says he was at the end of a rafting trip when he saw five people trying to cross the river they appeared to be asking him to help them across he kept going several months later janet napolitano then the

going to change the tax rate for the middle class that s huge for me i bought a house five years ago and the taxes have gone up 200 every single year scott doesn t trusts the elites entrenched politicians with money i don t trust mccain i don t trust rubio i don t trust paul ryan he says i love trump for calling out the elites and the ruling class for who they are because they have forgotten about the working man and working woman he is also suspicious of the term comprehensive immigration reform dianna says anytime a politician uses the word comprehensive it makes you think they are lying it s just an empty word smoke and mirrors they throw big words around make it look like they are actually doing something makes people feel like almost like they are not smart enough to understand what they are doing she added i think trump will deliver our dinner comes two shrimp salads and a burger miles driven 319 miles to go 151 new castle del 9 51 p m we are getting sleepy

       " 'mexico city joaquín guzmán loera the notorious drug lord known as el chapo who twice slipped out of mexican prisons and into criminal legend was extradited to the united states on thursday night officials said drawing to a close a quest to prosecute the head of one of the world s largest narcotics organizations a federal court in mexico denied an appeal by mr guzmán s lawyers to block the extradition clearing the way for his transfer to the american authorities in new york where he faces numerous charges for his role as the chieftain of the sinaloa cartel mr guzmán was put on a plane on thursday in ciudad juárez near the border with texas and arrived in the united states on president obama s final night in office according to a justice department statement late thursday he was flown to long island macarthur airport in islip n y the decision to extradite mr guzmán was an for the mexican government which once claimed that he would serve his long sentence in mexico first however after his escape in 2015 when his associates tunneled him out of mexico s most secure prison officials began to reconsider when he was recaptured early last year after one of mexico s most exhaustive manhunts the government publicly said it would allow the extradition of mr guzmán thus relieving itself of the potential embarrassment of another escape and preventing further souring of its relationship with the united states mr guzmán s extradition came suddenly after nearly a year of appeals and legal procedures even his own lawyer was surprised in an interview after the announcement by the mexican government the lawyer josé refugio rodríguez said he had only just learned about the extradition indeed he was at the prison where mr guzmán was being held planning to see his client when it was locked down for two hours i was supposed to visit him today he said i know nothing of this an american law enforcement official said the united states authorities had not known that the mexicans were about to hand over mr guzmán until late thursday afternoon the official who requested anonymity to discuss the case said the guesstimate was that the timing of the extradition was politically motivated the official did not elaborate mr guzmán whose nickname el chapo means shorty was a major trophy for law enforcement officials in both countries over the years as the drug trade blossomed into a industry he became much more than a mere trafficker as a with a flair for the dramatic he became a symbol of mexico s broken rule of law america s narcotics obsession and the failure of both nations drug wars and yet amid the anguish caused by mr guzmán the trail of blood left by his henchmen across swaths of mexico the addiction crisis fueled by his networks in america his legend only seemed to grow in mexico he became a folk hero to the masses in sinaloa tales of mr guzmán s handing out freebies to the poor and covering checks for diners in the restaurants he frequented are commonplace but his daring escapes cemented his reputation as an outlaw mr guzmán first managed to break out of a prison in 2001 according to some accounts by hiding in a laundry cart in the ensuing years while on the run he seemed always just out of the grasp of the authorities slipping into secret passages beneath bathtubs or absconding seconds before federal raids the fascination with mr guzmán stemmed from the fact that one could never really count him out he perfected the escape hatch the underground tunnel and the trap door all tools he used to evade law enforcement during his years on the run which ended with an arrest in 2014 he sent his engineers to germany for training then dispatched them to his homes where they would outfit closets bathrooms and refrigerators with secret exits a pioneer of the tunnel used to shuttle tens of thousands of tons of drugs into america he ultimately adapted those feats of secret underground engineering for his escape from the altiplano prison a facility in the state of mexico where he lived in isolation under surveillance by a camera in his cell on the night of july 11 2015 shortly before 9 p m mr guzmán stepped into his shower and passed through a small hole in its floor positioned in the camera s one blind spot from there he descended into a tunnel equipped with a motorcycle on rails and raced to freedom his escape was a stinging embarrassment for the government of president enrique peña nieto which had trumpeted his capture as a crucial victory in its bloody campaign against the narcotics trade again a fugitive mr guzmán found the time to rendezvous with film stars including sean penn to discuss a biopic about his life but his freedom was after a manhunt that involved more than 2 500 people he was seized in the town of los mochis in early 2016 after crawling out of a sewer once he was back in prison many worried that he would escape once more prompting the authorities to rotate him from cell to cell and eventually to send him up north to the border with texas the general belief is that in the united states el chapo s antics will be much harder to pull off though his reputation may not diminish his chances of escape or acquittal are drastically lower there experts say mr guzmán faces charges stemming from six separate indictments in the united states in the eastern district of new york in brooklyn where he is expected to face prosecution he is charged with the manufacture and distribution of a range of drugs the use of firearms money laundering and running an ongoing criminal enterprise the indictment first filed in 2009 has been updated three times since then in a statement on thursday night the united states justice department said it extended its gratitude to the government of mexico for their extensive cooperation and assistance in securing the extradition of guzmán loera to the united states in ridding itself of mr guzmán the mexican government has lifted at least one giant weight from its shoulders that of keeping and successfully prosecuting the notorious escape artist he is departing however at a time of deep political unrest in the country as protests over an increase in gasoline prices continue and corruption scandals as well as rising crime nag at the nation s image the american donald j trump has made threatening mexico over trade and immigration a center of his platform it is unclear whether the decision to extradite mr guzmán the day before mr trump s inauguration was connected in any way with the hostile tone the has adopted toward mexico the fact that we delivered him to obama is a clear political message that says this is a government we have long collaborated and worked closely with said jorge chabat an expert on security at cide a mexico city research institution by not waiting to send him to trump after his inauguration it is a subtle statement saying we could do this for you too in the future if we have a good relationship if not there won t be any other powerful narco traffickers extradited he said ',\n",
       " 'when c i a interrogators in a thailand prison sent a cable to agency headquarters recounting that they had been slamming abu zubaydah a captured terrorism suspect against a wall they emphasized that they were obeying instructions to take steps to prevent his injury like putting a towel behind his neck and described the practice in detached terms subject was walled with the question what is it that you do not want us to know reported a cable from aug 5 2002 part of a trove of newly disclosed documents about the agency s enhanced interrogation program subject continued to deny that he had any information from the perspective of mr zubaydah whom interrogators eventually conceded had no additional information contrary to their suspicions at the time the experience felt far different he kept banging me against the wall mr zubaydah told his lawyer in 2008 in a narrative that has now been declassified given the intensity of the banging that was strongly hitting my head i fell down on the floor with each banging i felt for few instants that i was unable to see anything let alone the short chains that prevented me from standing tall and every time i fell he would drag me with the towel which caused bleeding in my neck batches of newly disclosed documents about the central intelligence agency s defunct torture program are providing new details about its practices of slamming terrorism suspects into walls confining them in coffinlike boxes and subjecting them to waterboarding as well as internal disputes over whether two psychologists who designed the program were competent the release of the newly available primary documents which include information not discussed in a executive summary of the senate intelligence committee s investigation into the c i a torture program that was released in 2014 comes at the same time as an urgent legal battle is unfolding over the potential fate of the full version of that report lawyers for two detainees who were subjected to the c i a s most extreme enhanced interrogation techniques mr zubaydah and abd the suspected mastermind of the deadly october 2000 attack on the american destroyer cole are asking federal judges to order the executive branch to deposit a copy of the full report with the judiciary to ensure that the trump administration and congressional republicans do not destroy it but the obama administration in its waning hours is fighting that idea on thursday the judge overseeing mr zubaydah s habeas corpus case emmet g sullivan ordered the united states government to immediately preserve a complete unredacted copy of the senate report and deposit it with the court for secure storage by feb 10 against that backdrop the two sets of newly available documents present a vivid contrast in perspectives as the c i a cables recount in bloodless bureaucratese the infliction of techniques that mr zubaydah recalled experiencing in harrowing terms for example when interrogators at a c i a black site prison in thailand confined mr zubaydah in a cramped box on aug 5 2002 they observed to headquarters that he showed signs of distress according to one of the cables from a group the government declassified as part of a lawsuit against the psychologists who designed the program the lawsuit is being brought by detainees represented by lawyers including from the american civil liberties union the a c l u provided the documents to the new york times mr zubaydah remembered the box experience in more vivid terms i felt i was going to explode from bending my legs and my back and from being unable to spread them not even for short instants he wrote to his lawyers in 2008 noting that the box was so short and tight he could not sit up or change positions the very strong pain made me scream unconsciously other c i a cables also clinically recount applying torture methods like the suffocation technique known as waterboarding previously disclosed documents and the senate report executive summary had already discussed mr zubaydah s waterboarding in extensive detail including that he was subjected to the treatment 83 times in one month the contemporaneous cables describe him crying but generally use bland descriptions like water treatment was applied for mr zubaydah it felt as if he was dying they kept pouring water and concentrating on my nose and my mouth until i really felt i was drowning and my chest was just about to explode from the lack of oxygen mr zubaydah also described experiencing what he thought were persistent health consequences of his torture including severe headaches and seizures many other detainees experienced lasting harm after harsh treatment in american custody including stress disorder a recent new york times investigation found another group of documents produced in discovery from that lawsuit first provided by the a c l u to the washington post showed that in about a year after the agency hired the two contract psychologists james mitchell and j bruce jessen to design a torture regimen for mr zubaydah unidentified c i a employees raised sharp questions about their ethics and competence to judge whether the techniques they had orchestrated were harmful or effective while other documents including the senate report summary have shown that there were internal concerns about relying so heavily on the two psychologists the newly available documents add texture to that history for example a june 2003 message that appears to have been sent by an official representing a renditions and detainees group at the c i a which had assumed control of mr mitchell s and mr jessen s activities criticized the psychologists arrogance and narcissism and blatant disregard for the ethics shared by almost all of their colleagues but the same message also recommended that the two psychologists be assigned to develop a code of ethics and standards for interrogators we have identified this as a major gap in our program the official wrote a lawyer for the psychologists henry f schuelke iii declined to comment the newly available files supplement the publicly available historical record about the torture program intensifying questions about whether the public will ever see the full fruits of the senate intelligence committee s investigation the result of years of combing and contextualizing millions of pages of government documents by committee staff members democrats raised fears last month that the incoming administration of donald j trump who has voiced support for the outlawed interrogation methods detailed in the senate select committee on intelligence report could cause all copies of the document to be hidden indefinitely or destroyed in 2015 after republicans took control of the senate and the intelligence committee they asked president obama to return all copies of the full report which former democratic senators have said contains volumes of new information that were not made public when a executive summary was disclosed in 2014 mr obama did not comply with that request and in december of last year he notified the senate that he was including a copy of the full report in his presidential records that would be deposited at the national archives but michel paradis a lawyer for mr nashiri argued that mr obama s decision about his presidential records was insufficient because mr trump might seek to withdraw the report from the archives and destroy it last week in response to a request by mr nashiri s lawyers to secure a copy of the full report in the hands of the judiciary judge royce c lamberth of the federal district court for the district of columbia ordered the obama administration to provide a copy to the court s security officer lawyers for mr zubaydah are separately making the same request but in court filings the obama administration asked judge lamberth to reconsider making two arguments preserving it would interfere with branch relations and giving a copy to the court was unnecessary in part because of mr obama s archived copy it also suggested that the executive branch would appeal if the judge did not change his mind on thursday afternoon judge lamberth refused saying in a terse order that the court was obliged to protect mr nashiri s possible right to access the report and saying that nothing had changed since he issued the original crystal clear order he threatened to hold the executive branch in contempt if it did not comply although he did not set a specific deadline the c i a cables revealed other potentially important new details for example detainees at c i a prisons have long claimed that they were injected with unknown drugs against their consent which had powerful effects on them something that medical experts have denounced as unethical while previously released documents from 2004 said that c i a prisoners could be sedated as a last resort a newly released cable describes a different practice in april 2002 c i a personnel at an interrogation site wrote that they planned to transport a detainee apparently mr zubaydah in a state of pharmaceutical unconsciousness to decrease potential security concerns as well as to maximize the intended effect of disorienting him it is unclear from the documents whether the c i a followed through the new information is consistent with the conclusion of the senate committee s torture report that the c i a s use of enhanced interrogation techniques was not effective in acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees on aug 18 2002 after 15 days during which mr zubaydah was repeatedly waterboarded kept for hours in small boxes pushed into walls and threatened the interrogators sent a cable to headquarters stating their conclusions the prisoner has not provided significant actionable info beyond previously provided details they wrote ',\n",
       " 'a man in boston rolled several student loans into one and his balance doubled overnight with no explanation near chicago a former graduate student who had a financial windfall sent in a 10 000 check to pay off his loans and the payment was promptly lost the same thing happened to a woman in maryland who uncovered the problem three years later after her loan had grown by 11 000 and in new york city a homeless man who should qualify for reduced monthly payments has been pleading for a break on his loan payments but says that no one is listening sound familiar state and federal lawsuits filed this week accused navient the largest collector of student loan payments in the nation of the kind of sloppiness and misleading tactics that emerged in the mortgage market in the years after the financial crisis the company which is fighting the lawsuits has denied wrongdoing navient has a superior track record of helping student loan borrowers succeed in repayment patricia nash christel a company spokeswoman said in a written statement we will vigorously defend against these false allegations the accusations against navient by the nation s consumer watchdog agency and attorneys general in two states are aggravating a student loan crisis that has swept the united states student loan debt has surged to 1 4 trillion eclipsing the totals for auto loans and credit cards and burdening a generation with a mountain of debt just as its members try to find their financial footing in recent years the obama administration has significantly expanded programs that allow people with federal student loans to cap their monthly payments at a fixed portion of their income more than 80 percent of america s outstanding student debt is in the form of federal loans and most of the borrowers carrying that debt are eligible for such payment plans but enrolling in the programs can be complicated navient which services the loans of roughly 12 million current and former students across the country is responsible for keeping track of monthly payments on more than 300 billion in loans it also has tremendous power and leeway in shepherding struggling borrowers through the process of either capping their monthly payments based on income or finding other ways of reducing those payments guiding these borrowers takes time and training navient the lawsuits say steered clients toward options that were simpler for the company anna nepomuceno 40 who lives in tacoma wash has been trying for years to get help from navient around a decade ago her partner andrew brittell 46 took out multiple loans totaling tens of thousands of dollars to attend devry a school mr brittell now works in the billing department of a telecommunications company and takes home around 3 000 a month after taxes barely covering the basic living expenses for their family of five mr brittell s federal loans would probably qualify him for an repayment plan and he has repeatedly applied to navient to participate in such a program the company has repeatedly lost his paperwork ms nepomuceno said and each time navient suggested that mr brittell instead apply for yet another loan forbearance a program that suspends payments while interest continues to accrue several of mr brittell s loans have been in forbearance for more than five years ms nepomuceno said he has made no payments on them and the balance due has ballooned to more than 90 000 mr brittel will put in the paperwork and then they ll tell us that it never went through or that they lost it and we should go on forbearance she said adding this has happened over and over again it s like a vicious cycle navient declined to comment on individual customers cases but mr brittell s story is not unique according to the suits filed this week including one by the consumer financial protection bureau a government agency created under the 2010 financial reform laws that increased regulation of the financial industry lina vitakauskas who lives in the chicago area thought that repayment was something that only younger students could take advantage of it s not most federal borrowers are eligible for a plan but navigating the thicket of different options that are available each with their own eligibility requirements can be daunting it took more than six years ms vitakauskas 43 said to get her monthly payments lowered in the meantime her loan balance money she took out to earn a graduate degree in english grew to more than 100 000 nearly double what she originally borrowed i just felt like i was treading water she said half of navient s borrowers who were struggling and met the criteria for repayment plans would qualify for a 0 monthly payment the consumer bureau found in its analysis but since 2010 navient has enrolled some 1 5 million borrowers in at least two consecutive forbearances lasting 12 months or longer many of those borrowers would have been better off with an plan the bureau said adam s minsky a lawyer in boston has worked with hundreds of clients trying to resolve problems with navient they re not providing blatant misinformation but they re not providing the borrower with the full spectrum of what their rights and options are mr minsky said that in itself is a form of misrepresentation more than half of navient s customers who did manage to enroll in plans fell out of them because they did not complete the annual renewal paperwork a key step that navient failed to prominently alert borrowers to the lawsuits say navient also routinely lost or misapplied its customers payments according to the suits in december 2012 rahat khan of rockville md tried to make a dent in the loans she had taken out to finance her daughter s education going online to pay 38 000 she had borrowed against her house relieved ms khan 62 thought she was done but in 2015 she started to get collection calls on the student loan that she thought had been paid what loan i remember asking she said swollen with interest and late fees the loan had grown by 11 419 i went through circles and circles said ms khan whose credit was tarnished because of the loan it took kathleen hyland a lawyer in baltimore to straighten it out scott kenemore 39 who lives in evanston ill had no such help mr kenemore a writer sent navient a check in august 2015 to pay off a balance of around 10 000 remaining on his graduate school student loans navient lost it so he made a payment by phone instead then navient apparently found the check and tried to deposit it repeatedly i had to close my bank account over it because navient would just not stop and their customer service was absolutely useless mr kenemore said the roots of suits filed against navient this week stretch back years from october 2012 to march 2013 the consumer bureau logged more than 600 complaints about sallie mae from which navient split off in 2014 accounting for nearly half of all the complaints about student lenders during that period that number grew rapidly the agency s database now holds more than 11 000 complaints against sallie mae and navient complaints reported to c f p b represent fewer than of 1 percent of navient customers and have been consistent with or below the market share of the loans we service said ms christel of navient unless navient agrees to settle the lawsuits are likely to take years the consumer bureau and the attorneys general said they were seeking restitution and a change in the company s practices every single one of the borrowers who is having their loan serviced by navient or one of navient s companies is a borrower that s impacted said lisa madigan the illinois attorney general who filed one of the state cases if you re looking to put a price tag on

       " 'berlin volkswagen s former chief executive martin winterkorn yielded no ground on thursday during a polite grilling by german lawmakers over the carmaker s deception but he astonished them by insisting that he had not heard the term defeat device before september 2015 when the scandal broke appearing in public for the first time since he resigned over the case mr winterkorn who worked at the company for more than 35 years contended as he has all along that he had not been aware of any wrongdoing but his assertions are increasingly difficult to defend after volkswagen pleaded guilty in the united states last week to criminal charges that included conspiracy to defraud the government violations of the clean air act and obstruction of justice the company is paying 20 billion to resolve civil and criminal charges related to the scandal mr winterkorn who has not been charged was chief executive throughout the decade when as volkswagen now admits employees devised software known as a defeat device that could hide excess pollutants during testing by regulators the employees including several managers covered up the wrongdoing for years but in his comments on thursday mr winterkorn reiterated that he had not known of the efforts to evade emissions rules how striving for perfection could end this way mystified and preoccupied him mr winterkorn told a parliamentary committee charged with investigating the scandal and with determining if the german government had been aware of it before the news broke the unthinkable has happened and we must all deal with it it was doubly difficult to imagine mr winterkorn said because he had been in daily contact with employees and never did i have the impression that anyone was afraid to speak an open word with me whether mr winterkorn knew of the emissions cheating and is a crucial question for volkswagen even though he no longer leads the company any culpability on his part would make the company more vulnerable to lawsuits by shareholders who accuse the leadership of failing to properly disclose the risks it was taking the lawsuits seek billions of dollars in damages volkswagen s plea agreement with the justice department in washington last week left no doubt that the fraud was the work of dozens if not hundreds of employees rather than the result of a handful of rogue engineers as the company had first claimed the settlement calls for the carmaker to pay 4 3 billion in civil and criminal penalties to the american government the company did not say in the plea agreement that a member of the management board had known of the emissions cheating and cover up but several people indicted by american authorities last week had reported directly to mr winterkorn raising questions of what he had known those indicted last week are among company employees suspected of a that included feeding reams of false data to federal and state regulators who in 2014 began asking questions about emissions by diesel cars made by volkswagen when it became clear in that accusations of fraud would soon be made public a company lawyer prompted at least 40 employees to destroy potentially incriminating documents according to the plea agreement in 90 minutes of questioning on thursday mr winterkorn provided details on a variety of issues related to volkswagen s business but he was vague when asked about the emissions scandal and whom he had informed about it in part he was doing the german equivalent of invoking the fifth amendment in the united states citing an investigation by state prosecutors in braunschweig a city close to the carmaker s headquarters in wolfsburg the authorities in braunschweig are considering pursuing a case against mr winterkorn but the former chief executive also repeatedly replied i am not aware or i don t know when asked about conversations with chancellor angela merkel of germany and ferdinand piëch the chairman of volkswagen s supervisory board until late april 2015 mr winterkorn said that he had informed mr piëch in march 2015 about a recall in the united states of up to 500 000 vehicles a move consistent with his reputation for staying close to the chairman of the supervisory board he added however that he had not known the exact reason for the recall and that he therefore could not have relayed it to mr piëch members of the parliamentary committee voiced surprise and disappointment over mr winterkorn s testimony he missed a really good chance to shed more light said ulrich lange a christian social union lawmaker herbert behrens the chairman of the parliamentary committee investigating the issue described being incredulous when mr winterkorn said he had not heard of the term defeat device before the scandal broke there is some reason to doubt mr winterkorn s assertion mr gottweis a volkswagen executive who specialized in solving technical emergencies around the world warned in a memo in may 2014 that american regulators were likely to investigate whether volkswagen implemented a test detection system in the engine control unit software defeat device the memo was included in a stack of weekend reading given to mr winterkorn at the time but volkswagen has said it was not clear if mr winterkorn had read it mr gottweis reported directly to mr winterkorn however and it is deemed unlikely that a warning from an executive known internally as the fireman would have been ignored ',\n",
       " 'rome as night fell in italy s apennine mountains on thursday prospects dimmed of finding survivors of an avalanche that had swept over a small resort hotel the previous night at least 30 people were missing according to the authorities the avalanche occurred after four earthquakes struck central italy which has been hit hard in recent months giampiero parete a cook at the rigopiano hotel and one of the two known survivors had gone out to get something from his car when the avalanche struck his wife and two young children remained inside and are among the missing quintino marcella a restaurateur told the italian newspaper corriere della sera that he had received a frantic call for help from mr parete on wednesday night mr parete told him that the hotel had been wiped out the hotel isn t here anymore it s not here mr marcella told the newspaper he said that the guests had been waiting for a snow plow to clear the roads all the guests had their bags packed and were waiting to leave he said mr marcella said that he called the prefecture in pescara and an official told him that they had spoken to the hotel a few hours earlier and that everything was under control i insisted mr marcella told corriere della sera he said that he called police the carabinieri until someone finally said maybe there s something there the authorities told the italian media that they responded as soon as they learned of the disaster the latest seismic activity which prompted officials to close schools and the subway system in rome as a precaution shifted the nation s attention back to areas in central italy that were devastated by last year s earthquakes leading to criticism that victims had been left to fend for themselves fabrizio curcio the chief of the civil protection department told rai news that teams had reached the hotel but that they faced an enormous challenge rescue workers including dog units were moving with caution he said and some teams reported no signs of survivors news channels in italy showed images of the roof collapsed on the rigopiano and photographs suggesting that much of the structure had been buried by the avalanche the last time fulvio vagnarelli heard from his brother marco who was staying at the hotel with his girlfriend paola tomassini it was via a social media message late on wednesday afternoon he told me that they were about to leave but that they were delayed because of the snow mr vagnarelli told the ansa news agency cars were blocking the road and they were waiting for it to be cleared the father of a woman who worked at the hotel told radio24 that the staff had asked to leave after the quake because it was felt very strongly up there and so they asked to come down but there were three meters of snow how were they supposed to leave prime minister paolo gentiloni said the rescue effort presented officials with unprecedented difficulties describing the area as caught in a vise after intense snowfall that hadn t been recorded for decades and the strong earthquakes on wednesday the epicenters of the four earthquakes were in central italy which has been hit by deadly quakes with increasing frequency in recent years officials registered more than 100 aftershocks on thursday emergency vehicles tried to assist mountain rescue teams in the region part of the gran sasso national park but their efforts were hampered by heavy snow francesco provolo the prefect of pescara the province that includes farindola told rai that rescuers had to travel more than five miles on skis and snowshoes to reach the hotel as billowing snow continued to fall throughout the night a spokesman for the civil protection department in pescara estimated that up to 30 people were in the hotel at the time of the avalanche the hotel has 43 rooms but it was not clear how many guests were staying there at the time of the avalanche rescue efforts continued at the hotel which officials said had been swept from its foundations by the avalanche walter milan a spokesman for a specialized mountain rescue team told rai that rescuers were examining the scene of the avalanche section by section to exclude that people remained trapped underneath in the nearby hamlet of ortolano which has been cut off by the snow 21 people were airlifted by helicopter to the airport in l aquila said a spokesman for the italian financial police which was involved in the rescue operations three quakes in central italy last year killed nearly 300 people in and around the medieval town of amatrice on wednesday the tower of one of that town s churches was destroyed by temblors in 2009 the town of l aquila was devastated by an earthquake that killed more than 300 people the latest earthquakes were a new setback for thousands of commercial industrial and agricultural enterprises in four central italian regions that have been struggling to recover from the natural disasters of the summer and fall mr gentiloni praised the courage of rescue workers trying to reach the hotel and he said the country s heart and mind were closely following their efforts everyone is doing as much as they can to reach people clear roads and bring electricity to areas that have been cut off for days the prime minister said but i ask all operators to increase their commitment they have shown that they exist are present and are working but i ask them if possible to do even more the avalanche had buried cars and nearly everything else in its path the national institute of geophysics and volcanology said that more than 47 000 temblors and aftershocks had rattled the region since august and that there was no sign the situation would change anytime soon after the earthquake in l aquila in 2009 the earth shook for four years even though it wasn t always perceptible to people said carlo meletti the director of the seismic hazard center at the institute we expect the sequence will last for many weeks he said after yesterday s quakes it is as though it has picked up in vigor we have always said that there were strong possibilities of new stronger earthquakes and now a new fault has opened he continued the one thing we don t know is when they will occur or where because the area that has been affected by the quakes is so vast mr meletti said in a telephone interview that it was unclear if the avalanche was a direct result of the earthquakes on wednesday but that a link was possible considering that a lot of snow had fallen in a very short time and it was very unstable echoing a refrain heard after the earthquakes last year

       " 'a of lead exploded from the barrel of a pistol at 1 300 feet per second the bullet sped toward carlos vasquez who ran just steps ahead of the gunman but it missed its mark just outside the melrose houses in the south bronx and kept whistling through the air it sailed for 150 yards along east 154th street down the slope between courtlandt and elton avenues staying airborne as the ground fell away maribel cavero 45 was crossing the street at the base of that hill unaware that a shot had been fired during a running fight between young men in the housing project she had just delivered a carton of sugar substitute to her diabetic grandmother on east 154th street and was on her way to pick up her niece from school the bullet slowed and tumbled as it dropped then with the last of its fading energy it tore into ms cavero alejandro almonte 45 a heard ms cavero yelp and saw her fall he later said he thought she must have had a seizure he ran to where she lay facedown on the blacktop by a small car s bumper she was dying the bullet having pierced her heart at about 12 50 p m on nov 2 a sunny wednesday the slug passed through her chest and rolled to a stop under a jeep parked near a house at 426 east 154th street the bullet was strangely pristine hardly deformed by its deadly work as investigators began to piece together how the woman had been shot sgt michael j lopuzzo the commander of the 40th precinct detective squad looked uphill where the bullet had been fired and downhill where it had come to rest and surveyed the maze of telephone poles streetlights wires cars and trees in between the bullet had improbably traveled nearly two city blocks to strike an unintended victim and log the precinct s 14th and final homicide of 2016 it couldn t have hit a tree he said shaking his head a light pole a sign it was grim news for detectives in the 40th precinct where the new york times has been examining every homicide logged in 2016 a succession of assassinations gang killings domestic murders and random slayings half the cases remained unsolved and sergeant lopuzzo s investigators were already struggling to find the person responsible for the fatal shooting of another innocent bystander jessica white cut down on a playground in june now less than a mile away and five months later the police had another mystery and another blameless bystander lying crumpled on the ground detectives were initially unable to explain what had happened the mayor s office called the chief of detectives and the chief of detectives called sergeant lopuzzo the message was simple do all you can the department flooded the streets with rookies who picked through trash and shined flashlights in alleyways and sewer grates searching for any potential evidence detectives checked ms cavero s background for clues the head of bronx detectives deputy chief jason wilcox stalked the streets between the projects and the businesses on third avenue the area around him abuzz with the police it was a striking show of force and a marked escalation from the police response after ms white was killed as she tried to shield her children from gunfire as the afternoon hours wore on sergeant lopuzzo and his detectives started getting breaks things lined up in ways they seldom do in this part of the bronx where witnesses rarely agree to testify and investigative staffing is one of the lowest in the city despite a rate that is the highest by late the next night orlando oquendo a who the police believed had fired the bullet was in handcuffs having been identified in a lineup by mr vasquez the man who said he was the target mr oquendo who still looked very much a teenager had been arrested several times including twice on gun possession charges according to court documents and his mother that kid was on a road sergeant lopuzzo said it was just a matter of time less than 48 hours elapsed from death to arrest and what detectives in this corner of the city say they hope for but rarely see came to pass the police and the people in the community had cooperated to solve a killing it s supposed to read like a book sergeant lopuzzo said weeks later explaining how he wished all cases went that way where you can read all the steps in the investigation and what they saw and what they found and what the video shows and what the evidence shows so it s all one big package it was a luxury the sergeant said his squad often did not have the day she died maribel cavero and her mother maria reyes had cooked crabs for an early lunch using a recipe from their native ecuador together with ms cavero s younger sister alexandra cavero 44 they sat at a small table in the family s apartment in the melrose houses only a block from the corner where the shot would be fired ms cavero regaled them with family gossip and news from their home country the sisters had joined their mother in the united states in 2008 about 12 years after she followed her own mother from guayaquil ecuador to the south bronx in hopes of more earnings and a better life when lunch was finished ms cavero s mother reminded her to drop off the box of sugar substitute to her grandmother marcela troncoso the family matriarch who lived in an apartment on east 154th street as she did most days ms cavero was headed to pick up her sister s daughter gabriela encalada from school because her sister had to leave for her job as a bus driver but ms cavero would make time for the delivery she said i m in a hurry but i ll do it ms reyes said in a recent interview i ll do it ms cavero had no husband no boyfriend and no children her relatives said she enjoyed certain solitary pursuits like romance novels and the online game farmville and aside from family her regular social activity was mass at immaculate conception church on east 150th street she lived in her own world her sister said she was still very naïve with what relatives called a tranquil focus she poured her energy into caring for her mother and helping to raise her niece whom she considered like a daughter she loved tragic poetry her sister said and the writings of pablo neruda and the novels of corín tellado a prolific romance writer at night she would watch elvis presley movies referring to the singer as her eternal love she watched james bond movies too but told friends she avoided real romantic entanglements because in her view they always brought pain in high school they used to say she seemed like she was in love because when she was into a book into a piece of literature she expressed it and the others would tell her you re in love and her answer would be yes i m in love with life her sister said in some ways you seem like a little girl and in some ways you re like an old lady i used to tell her ms cavero worked for a few years as a nanny her mother said but as the children she watched grew the job ended and she wound up working another job her stepfather found for her at a mcdonald s on sixth avenue and 28th street in manhattan the shifts began late in the day which gave her time to pick up gabriela but they often ended near midnight coming home that late she usually called her mother to tell her she was leaving work her mother said ms cavero was afraid of the neighborhood this is a bad place here ms reyes said sometimes gunfights are heard outside when the mcdonald s was being remodeled in the fall ms cavero seized the opportunity to go to ecuador she stayed for 45 days with her father luis cavero she wasn t thrilled to return to new york where she had been frustrated in finding meaningful work and she talked of moving home once her niece was older her sister said why did this happen her sister asked i don t understand she was a person who had no vices for the investigation into ms cavero s killing finding the small smooth slug under a jeep near the body was the case s first big break detectives who found it cordoned off the area with crime scene tape one hunched down unloaded the magazine of his own pistol and pulled out a bullet to compare the slugs were the same size another bystander told officers he had seen a man running wildly with something black in his hand through the melrose playground a block and a half away detectives traced a ballistic path westward along east 154th street and found a plumber who told them he had seen the shooting as he walked with his lunch from the twin deli grocery at east 154th and courtlandt the plumber told detectives he saw one young man chase another then stop and raise his arm he heard a gunshot and the tinkle of a brass shell hitting the sidewalk as the gunman turned back and sprinted into the melrose houses the shell was there under some scaffolding on the northeast corner and detectives placed a white foam cup over it to preserve it as evidence after detectives went looking for surveillance video they found footage from at least five nearby stores and buildings a bonanza in a neighborhood where security cameras are scarce and often out of order one video showed a teenager racking a gun dropping something then firing on the street besides the shell casing detectives discovered an object they believed had also fallen from the gunman s hands a silver cigarette lighter television satellite trucks began showing up a rare but welcome sight for investigators in this part of the city who hoped publicity might encourage witnesses to come forward the evening news broadcasts were soon underway and in a place where even horrific killings often draw only brief coverage the local stations were going big with the news of an innocent bystander shot dead for sergeant lopuzzo a steady diet of coffee and cigarettes does nothing to blunt his frustration over witnesses who will not speak in case after case as recently as a shooting on new year s day even seriously injured victims tell a similar story felt pain saw nothing but the cavero case was already going differently and then a call came from the 40th precinct station house on alexander avenue detectives told the sergeant who was still at the scene that a man had walked into the squad room claiming to have been in the gunman s cross hairs i said do not let him leave sergeant lopuzzo recalled within minutes the man carlos vasquez was putting his account in writing in front of a detective in his statement he said he saw the news of ms cavero s death on television and realized that a woman was shot and killed by the bullet that was intended for me i informed my family that i was going to the precinct so i can tell the detectives what happened and tell them i wanted this guy brought to justice he said in his statement which both he and a detective signed it s one of the rare things where he s got a conscience sergeant lopuzzo later said mr vasquez had been arrested more than a dozen times and had been convicted of drug dealing and illegal possession of a knife he was a if drug dealer he sold in the melrose houses near the corner of east 153rd street and courtlandt avenue where his mother lived according to court records and the police in implicating mr oquendo mr vasquez never explained how the fight had started in his own words he said he had left his building on nov 2 in search of marijuana and was waiting for a dealer near a flagpole at the neighboring jackson houses when two men assaulted him he ran but before he could make it to the safety of his mother s house one of the assailants closed the gap with a gun in hand as i m running i turn around to see him point a gun at me and fire it mr vasquez said in his statement though he did not know mr oquendo s name i ducked between cars even before mr vasquez came in detectives reviewing the recovered video images from the deli s cameras thought they had identified a suspect officers assigned to a plainclothes unit recognized the person in the surveillance footage as mr oquendo the teenager with a lengthy arrest record who was known to officers as gumby the case detective ivan monge also knew the gunman when he saw the video he had arrested mr oquendo s older sister on assault charges in october i told myself wait this is gumby this is oquendo he said detectives did not recover the gun but with the videos the witnesses the bullet the shell casing and the name of the suspect lining up sergeant lopuzzo s team made one more breakthrough detective david rodriguez remembered that the suspect s mother was an old neighbor of his from spanish harlem they had grown up together their families had attended the same church and they had spoken after one of mr oquendo s previous arrests the detective contacted the mother s relatives on facebook and eventually got her on the phone he told her he needed her to bring in her son safely like a mother she didn t believe it detective rodriguez said and she wanted the proof detective rodriguez went to her home and took her to the squad room where he showed her a wanted flier with an image of her son taken from the videos she came in only because she trusted him said detective john caruso another detective working on the case finally she broke down yeah she said according to detective rodriguez that s my son by the next night the detectives were packed in the lobby of the legal aid society s office on east 161st street in the bronx steven mechanic a veteran public defender who had represented mr oquendo against several criminal charges in the past surrendered him to the police there are no winners in this case mr mechanic said later declining to discuss the new charges or mr oquendo s previous convictions mr oquendo was led away his parents cried he told me he came over from cuba on a boat 20 years ago detective rodriguez said of the suspect s father i know the mother s side of the family personally i ve known them for years he comes from a good family but everyone takes their own path in life orlando oquendo s mother sat in her living room in the jackson houses one recent night with a stack of letters written by her son in jail piled on her lap she nodded toward the streets outside her window and spoke of her son s sorrow for ms cavero s death if he did do it it was not intentional it was not toward her she said of the shooting a person was lost so it s going to hurt she felt a kinship for ms cavero s family both were latino families she said one from puerto rico and cuba the other from ecuador both were churchgoing and both were living in a area they wanted to escape mr oquendo s mother said that taking the apartment in the jackson houses 11 years ago was the worst decision she had ever made mr oquendo the fourth of her six children was troubled and from a young age attended a special school for emotionally disturbed children it was hard to stay neutral in the project s gang feuds and he got into fights constantly he seemed unable to back down from a threat he would not stay shut when challenged said his mother who spoke on the condition that her name not be published he had good hands he could defend himself twice her son was accused of crimes involving guns according to court documents and law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential records in february 2014 a young woman told the police that mr oquendo who was 15 fired several shots at her one official said he was indicted on a gun possession charge in that case which was transferred to family court and sealed then in august 2015 he was arrested when a police officer saw him drop a revolver wrapped in a on courtlandt avenue near east 157th street a criminal complaint said he later pleaded guilty to a reduced charge and was given a conditional discharge the official said mr oquendo s mother said he was supposed to be graduating from high school this month and then going to work for his father s plumbing business her son had been coaching young basketball players at the local classic community center on the courts where chris mccullough of the brooklyn nets once reigned he had proposed to his longtime girlfriend telling her they could someday move to a safer neighborhood with their son o j born on aug 16 if this kid could relive this day i m sure he wouldn t do the same thing that he did sergeant lopuzzo said but once you pull that trigger you can t pull that back still the pressures were mounting said mr oquendo s mother who referred to him as her prayer baby for his constant comfort of her he watched her battle diabetes and heart disease and saw his maternal grandmother dying of colon cancer the streets enveloped him she said in october he had a dispute with mr vasquez outside a local barbershop on the day of the shooting mr vasquez s nephew a friend of the oquendo family sent messages to mr oquendo s sister to find out what had happened after speaking with detective rodriguez mr oquendo s mother reached her son and asked him to surrender i told him the best thing to do is to turn yourself in and let s see what happens she said i don t want my son out on the run now he is in a rikers island jail cell facing a indictment on murder and other charges he turned 18 there and spent thanksgiving and christmas alone but his letters and cards keep coming almost daily filled with apologies for letting his mother down and promising to come home in a letter on dec 30 he told her not to worry writing god has a plan and let s hope god gives us a short easy punishment ms cavero s relatives who are tracking the suspect s court appearances are afraid of just that a light sentence detectives said that mr oquendo s intended victim mr vasquez picked him out of a police lineup but that the plumber who witnessed the shooting had been too afraid to try the same dna tests on the silver lighter recovered near the shell casing were inconclusive in her living room two blocks from the oquendo family ms cavero s mother ms reyes also sat on a couch with a pile of envelopes these containing court papers and other official documents she thought back to the moment the police informed her of her daughter s killing detective monge the case detective had knocked on her door to deliver the news in spanish and she was grateful for his compassion but even after a wake in which her daughter was dressed all in white and a funeral in ecuador she said the randomness of the death in which a person with no enemies or vices was taken violently remained the abiding mystery it is a question the police cannot answer that is what i ask myself ms reyes said tears falling down her cheeks why did this happen this way ',\n",
       " 'davos switzerland for the investors and at the annual world economic forum here a threat lurks at cocktail parties where the champagne flows financiers have expressed bewilderment over the rise of populist groups that are feeding a backlash against globalization in the halls of the davos congress center where many of the meetings this week are taking place investors have tried to make sense of the political upheaval the world order has been upended as the united states retreats from the promise of free trade china is taking up the mantle the stark shift leaves investors trying to assess the new risk and opportunities in the global economy this is the first time there is absolutely no consensus said william f browder a of hermitage capital management who has been coming to davos for 21 years everyone is looking into the abyss the religion of the global elite free trade and open markets is under attack and there has been a lot of over what christine lagarde of the international monetary fund has declared a crisis but while all attendees in davos have a view on the state of the world there is little agreement on how to deal with it the biggest concern finding a way to make the people who are driving populist movements feel like they are part of the global economic pie that davos participants have created and largely own in a twitter post from the swiss resort ian bremmer the president of eurasia group a firm offered his advice elites won t be able to manage populism until they stop seeing it as a threat and start seeing it as a symptom if that is the case davos has so far made little progress i want to be loud and clear populism scares me ray dalio the billionaire hedge fund manager said during a panel on how to fix the crisis the no 1 issue economically as a market participant is how populism manifests itself over the next year or two but mr dalio offered little by way of a solution beyond opining on the positive aspects of loosening regulation and lowering taxes on the subject of rising populism mr dalio who runs the 150 billion investment firm bridgewater associates added it s an way of operating jack ma the founder of alibaba in china offered his view of the problem in the united states americans he said do not distribute the money properly if there was one thing that davos attendees agreed on last year it was that donald j trump would not win the united states presidential election and so this year with mr trump s inauguration on friday coinciding with the end of the world economic forum every conversation has drifted to one question what will the trump presidency look like and what will it mean for business to many american financiers who once opposed mr trump s candidacy the prospect of fewer regulations and a blank slate with a new leader has assuaged some of the fear about uncertainties at the forum some attendees have been thrust into a role of interpreting the to a befuddled global elite he s not necessarily communicating in a way that the people in this community would love said anthony scaramucci a hedge fund regular at davos and onetime critic of mr trump who is now set to join the administration as a public liaison and adviser but he is communicating very very effectively to a very large group of the population in europe and the u s that are feeling a common struggle right now mr scaramucci promised that mr trump had the utmost respect for angela merkel the german chancellor who was the subject of an attack by the this week that he was in fact a champion of free trade and that he wanted to have a phenomenal relationship with the chinese despite his fiery language soon after his appearance on a panel mr scaramucci was on a plane heading to washington to attend mr trump s inauguration but his words still resonated mainly because they were being broadcast on a giant screen behind a coffee bar where world economic forum participants congregated between meetings one davos regular the billionaire investor paul singer did not attend this year mr singer a vociferous critic of mr trump for most of the election campaign was instead making his way to washington for the inauguration having recently donated 1 million to the event one major investor has not changed his views about mr trump however george soros the investor and philanthropist who has called mr trump a con man hosted a dinner on thursday evening in davos during which he said that mr trump would be a dictator if he could get away with it this was unlikely to happen he added because of strong democratic institutions in the united states for those who have been puzzled over market euphoria since mr trump s election mr soros put it this way markets see trump dismantling regulations and reducing taxes and that has been their dream but mr soros who became known as the man who broke the bank of england with a bet against the british pound in 1992 added that he was convinced that mr trump would fail i don t think the markets are going to do very well he said when president xi jinping addressed the davos forum becoming the first chinese head of state to do so his message was clear china is ready for the world stage he championed free trade and open markets setting the tone for the week on the sidelines the country s business leaders echoed that sentiment among the delegation that arrived in davos with mr xi were some of china s biggest business leaders including mr ma wang jianlin of dalian wanda and top executives from baidu huawei technologies and china telecom through the week they have been meeting with investors and talking deals with erstwhile partners with mr xi s help china has fashioned itself here as a new leader of the world i wasn t sure if it was president xi or ronald reagan joked thomas w farley president of the new york stock exchange at a lunch with mr ma of alibaba mr xi was quoting abraham lincoln mr ma told a small group of participants on wednesday it was a message somewhat at odds with the roots of china s ruling communist party and back in washington wilbur ross mr trump s nominee for commerce secretary did not mince words calling china the most protectionist major economy setting the stage for a possible trade war but in davos there was a sense that change in the economic order was afoot alicia bárcena ibarra who heads the united nations economic commission for latin america and the caribbean told a small group that china could soon overtake the united states when it comes to importance in latin america she described how on the same day last year that mr trump told the world he would not sign the partnership mr xi arrived for a summit meeting in chile so can you imagine the impact when he came talking about free trade as he did this morning she said referring to mr xi s address on tuesday in davos china now is the important trade partner of latin america after the u s maybe this is going to change she added very soon ',\n",
       " 'roberta peters the coloratura soprano who at 20 was catapulted to stardom by a phone call a subway ride and a metropolitan opera debut her first public performance anywhere all in the space of five hours died on wednesday at her home in rye n y she was 86 the cause was parkinson s disease her son bruce fields said ms peters who would sing with the met 515 times over 35 vigorous years was internationally renowned for her high silvery voice in private she could hit a high a two and a half octaves above middle c her clarion diction in a flurry of languages her attractive stage presence and by virtue of the fact that she and television came to prominence at about the same time her wide popular appeal as a coloratura cue magazine wrote of ms peters in 1960 she has no peer in addition to the met with which she appeared regularly from 1950 to 1985 one of the longest associations of any singer with a major opera company ms peters was heard at the lyric opera of chicago cincinnati opera the vienna state opera covent garden and elsewhere her roles include the queen of the night in mozart s the magic flute rosina in rossini s the barber of seville gilda in verdi s rigoletto and oscar a pageboy played by a soprano in his un ballo in maschera but her most significant role was undoubtedly zerlina in mozart s don giovanni enlisted to sing that part in 1950 as a substitute ms peters was propelled with no rehearsal onto the met stage and into a stellar career known for taking meticulous care of her voice she continued to sing in recital until well into her 70s a good two decades past the de facto retirement age in her line of work at midcentury when it was more customary to encounter opera stars on television than it is today she was seen on a string of shows including the voice of firestone the mike douglas show and in particular the ed sullivan show on which she appeared scores of times in the 1950s and 60s later in her career she performed in operetta and musical theater one thing that allowed ms peters to sing so long was a prudent awareness of what her voice could and could not do possessed of a light fleet instrument she confined herself to coloratura and soubrette roles steering clear of heavier fare critics sometimes faulted ms peters s singing for a certain lack of intensity but her flageolet tones made an airy counterweight to the vocal heft of maria callas and joan sutherland whose style was becoming the norm for sopranos at midcentury i would love to sing tosca ms peters told the los angeles times in 1986 and salome those are my dream roles but i won t do them at least not in this life they would kill me vocally another thing that kept ms peters singing was her impeccable technique from the age of 13 she had trained for an operatic career as an athlete trains for the olympics for years her weekly regimen included not only voice and foreign language lessons but also instruction in ballet acting and fencing as well as a strength and conditioning program under the direct supervision of joseph pilates the originator of the pilates exercise method although ms peters s voice teacher william herman did not want her to sing in public until she was thoroughly groomed he insisted that she make a deep study of the operatic literature by the time she was 19 and auditioned for the met she knew the scores of 20 operas cold providentially as things fell out don giovanni was one of them roberta peterman an only child was born on may 4 1930 and grew up near jerome avenue and 170th street in the bronx her father solomon was a shoe salesman her mother the former ruth hirsch a milliner as a girl roberta in the words of her family had a real voice on her when she was 13 her grandfather the maître d hotel at grossinger s the redoubt of jewish life in the catskills asked the celebrated tenor jan peerce né jacob pincus perelmuth who was singing there to hear her impressed mr peerce arranged for roberta to study with mr herman whose students included the metropolitan opera coloratura patrice munsel who died last year leaving school permanently after she completed junior high roberta took six lessons a week from mr herman on a scholarship he also arranged for supplementary instruction in french italian german dance and drama mr pilates meanwhile did his part by standing regularly on roberta s abdomen he weighed 174 pounds she 119 to help her develop the musculature essential for breath control all this proved so effective that at 16 roberta was offered a role in street scene a musical with music by kurt weill and lyrics by langston hughes that would open on broadway in 1947 though the salary would have been welcome in a family of modest means roberta with the support of her parents turned it down she had set her sights on opera and would not be deterred in late 1949 ms peters she had shortened her surname at her teacher s suggestion was taken on by sol hurok the impresario he soon arranged an audition with the met s new general manager rudolf bing on jan 23 1950 the ms peters stood on the stage of the old metropolitan opera house on broadway and 39th street in manhattan there in the darkened hall she sang der hölle rache hell s vengeance the queen of the night s aria from the magic flute which with its fiendish series of high f s is among the canonical texts of the coloratura repertory somewhere out in the darkness was mr bing it was the first audition i had done for anyone and i was so scared ms peters told the chicago tribune in 1993 when it was over he asked if i would sing it again then he asked me to do it again well i sang it four times not knowing that he had silently brought in conductors fritz reiner fausto cleva and fritz stiedry to hear me signed to a met contract ms peters was scheduled to make her debut with the company as the queen of the night in january 1951 but on nov 17 the soprano nadine conner scheduled to sing zerlina in a met don giovanni that night fell ill at 3 p m mr bing telephoned ms peters and told her to report to the opera house in time for an 8 o clock curtain ms peters who had planned to watch the performance with her mother from the section that night informed her parents that they now had box seats the family then living at broadway and 71st street rushed to the street and hailed a taxi when the cab became stuck in traffic they jumped out and took the subway at the opera house there was no time for real rehearsal ms peters s only preparation to play zerlina the country girl who catches don giovanni s roving eye took the form of hurried consultations with the stage director herbert graf and the conductor mr reiner she was hustled into a costume the other singers would help her hit her marks onstage by gently propelling her wherever she needed to be are you nervous the baritone paul schöffler that night s don giovanni asked her before the curtain no numb ms peters replied and on she went the delightful surprise of last night s performance of don giovanni at the metropolitan was the emergency debut of little roberta peters in the part of zerlina the new york s review the next day said the voice came through the big house as clear as a bell the notes equally bright and focused and the phrasing that of a true musician and the girl she is all of 5 feet 2 turned in a very smooth job of acting too from then on ms peters was in great demand both at the met where she sang her planned queen of the night on jan 12 1951 and around the world as if her debut had foreordained as much she developed something of a specialty as an substitute for indisposed singers ms peters was by all accounts one of opera s least divalike divas she was exceptionally game not hesitating for instance to don a chicken suit for an episode of captain kangaroo in 1975 one is to picture maria callas in similar confines she appeared in several memorable tv commercials in one for chock full o nuts ms peters sang the company s signature jingle in mellifluous italian in another for american express part of its do you know me campaign she hailed a cab by singing out in a descending major third from g to e flat she had dramatic roles in several movies including tonight we sing 1953 based on mr hurok s life and on tv shows including medical center on which in 1975 she played a dying singer the closest thing to drama in ms peters s personal life was her very brief marriage to the great baritone robert merrill whom she wed on march 30 1952 and from whom she was divorced on june 26 1952 ms peters later said that she had fallen in love with the voice rather than the man but they remained friends and sometime partners ever after ms peters s second husband bertram fields a hotelier and investor whom she married in 1955 died in 2010 in addition to her son bruce she is survived by another son paul and four grandchildren her many recordings include works by mozart rossini verdi cole porter and gilbert and sullivan for all the acclaim that cloaked ms peters and for all the laurels heaped upon her including a national medal of arts in 1998 perhaps nothing could match the electricity of that november night when a from the bronx stepped onto the met stage an unknown and came back as roberta peters an ovation followed and flowers along with it afterward ms peters took a taxi all the way

       " 'our fellow primates are in trouble in a study of unprecedented scope a team of 31 primatologists has analyzed every known species of primate to judge how they are faring the news for man s closest animal relatives is not good of primate species are in decline the researchers found and about 60 percent are now threatened with extinction from gorillas to gibbons primates are in significantly worse shape now than in recent decades because of the devastation from agriculture hunting and mining i think we re going to get quite a number of extinctions within next 50 years if things go on the way they are said anthony b rylands a senior research scientist at conservation international and a of the new study which was published in science advances it s a landmark paper said anne d yoder the director of the duke lemur center who was not involved in the study it s alarming without being alarmist taking stock of every primate species on earth was a huge challenge in part because scientists keep finding new ones since 2000 85 new primate species have been identified bringing the total to 505 just last week a team of researchers described a new species of gibbon in china dr rylands said he knows of at least seven new primate species to be announced this year scientists are finding so many new primate species in part because the destruction of forests is making it easier to reach populations that were once remote there is a certain rush of people in a panic realizing that if they don t find and describe them they will be lost without us ever knowing them said dr rylands another reason for the burst of discovery is that scientists have started investigating the dna of primates finding that some populations had unique mutations there are distinct species that have been around for millions of years even though they look to our eyes very similar said dr yoder unfortunately she noted new species revealed by dna often turn out to exist in perilously low numbers the new research was not all bad news for primates some species are doing o k said katherine c mackinnon an anthropologist at saint louis university and a of the study the ones that are doing o k are the ones that aren t the ones that are most flexible but most species are not so flexible every species of ape including gorillas chimpanzees bonobos orangutans and 19 species of gibbons is threatened while 87 percent of lemur species are other species that are critically endangered include the spider monkey of ecuador the niger delta red colobus and the crested macaque an indonesian species famous for having taken a selfie with a photographer s camera it s worse than we thought 10 years ago dr mackinnon said she and her colleagues identified a number of human activities pushing primates to the edge such as hunting in west africa for example there is a strong demand in local markets for primate meat the forests are still standing but they ve shot everything out of it said dr rylands the incentives to kill primates are not only local though a lot of primate meat is making its way to china along with body parts falsely believed to have healing powers they ll import enormous amounts from around southeast asia said dr rylands they re a driving force through the whole region primates are also threatened by the wholesale destruction of forests to make way for agriculture in the amazon the jungle is being converted to cattle ranches and soybean fields while in madagascar rice paddies are taking the place of lemur forests western countries are also helping push primates toward extinction palm oil can be found in everything from doughnuts to lipstick to biodiesel fuel new palm oil plantations are completely replacing forests in southeast asia one of the most parts of the world even cellphones can add to the risks in central africa miners go into rain forests to dig for an ore called coltan that ends up in phone circuits those miners hunt for their meals they live on primates said dr rylands humans have already driven some primate species extinct but it s hard to say exactly how many madagascar was once home to giant lemurs that could weigh as much as 350 pounds while western scientists never laid eyes on these remarkable creatures the fossil record shows that 17 lemur species became extinct after humans arrived there 2 000 years ago more recently a monkey called miss waldron s red colobus has disappeared from its range in west africa it has not been spotted for over 25 years and is believed to be extinct in china a subspecies called the gibbon may have gone extinct as well some of the most endangered primate species are down to just a few dozen survivors their prospects are grim because many of them live in parts of the world where human populations are projected to grow the fastest in madagascar for example humans may have to move deeper into lemur habitats for new farmland it s a pressure cooker and there s no way to relieve the pressure said dr yoder the authors of the new study offer a number of reasons it is worth trying to halt the crisis recent research has shown that primates are extremely important to the ecosystems in which they live as they feed on leaves and fruit for example they move pollen between trees they pass seeds in their droppings allowing plants to spread across a healthy range people used to think of primates as icing on the cake as not being vital for ecosystems said dr mackinnon but now we know they are primates have also been invaluable for understanding ourselves the first primates evolved roughly 80 million years ago and then split into the living lineages over millions of years by comparing our biology to those of other primates we have learned about the evolution of our brains our vision and our vulnerability to diseases if those species become extinct we will lose the opportunity to learn more while the prospects are dire dr rylands said there were concrete steps that can be taken to help primates you have to stop hunting them and give them a place to live he said that is easier said than done he acknowledged since the local communities where primates live are often struggling to feed their families in some cases it may be possible to take the pressure off primates by building fish farms as an alternate source of protein in other cases communities may be able to make more money over the long term from tourist operations in intact forests than from agriculture dr rylands pointed to the golden lion tamarin as an example of how a primate species can be saved it once lived in huge numbers in the atlantic coastal forests of brazil after the forests were nearly wiped out to make way for sugar plantations and other forms of agriculture the species nearly vanished in 1983 the u s national zoo led an international effort to bring them back monkeys were bred in captivity forests were conserved and hunting was banned today the species has a small but stable population of some 3 500 individuals in the wild there are cases where you can bring them back from the brink said dr rylands but the immensity of the destruction of tropical forests makes it very difficult ',\n",
       " 'in the fall of 2012 a fisherman and carver named terry st germain decided to enroll his five young children as members of the nooksack a federally recognized native american tribe with some 2 000 members centered in the northwestern corner of washington state he d enrolled his two older daughters from a previous relationship when they were babies but hadn t yet filed the paperwork to make his younger children all of whom including a set of twins were under 7 official members he saw no reason to worry about a bureaucratic endorsement of what he knew to be true my kids they love being native he told me st germain was a teenager when he enrolled in the tribe for decades he used tribal fishing rights to harvest salmon and sea urchin and dungeness crab alongside his cousins he had dozens of family members who were also nooksack his mother according to family lore was directly descended from a nooksack chief known as matsqui george his brother rudy was the secretary of the nooksack tribal council which oversaw membership decisions the process he figured would be so straightforward that his kids would be certified nooksacks in time for christmas when the tribe gives parents a small stipend for buying gifts i thought it was a situation but after a few months the applications had still not gone through when rudy asked why at a tribal council meeting the chairman bob kelly called in the enrollment department they told rudy that they had found a problem with the paperwork there were missing documents ancestors seemed to be incorrectly identified they didn t think terry s children s claims to tribal membership could be substantiated at the time rudy and kelly were friends allies on the council at the long oval table where they met to discuss nooksack business rudy always sat at kelly s right but the debate over whether rudy s family qualified as nooksack tore them apart today more than four years later they no longer speak rudy and his extended family refer to kelly as a monster and a dictator he calls them pond scum and con artists they agree on almost nothing but both remember the day when things fell apart the same way if my nephew isn t nooksack rudy said in the council chambers then neither am i to rudy the words were an expression of shock it s fighting words he said to tell someone they re not really part of their tribe at stake were not just his family s jobs and homes and treaty rights but also who they were and where they belonged i ll still be who i am but i won t have proof rudy said i ll be labeled a so yeah i take this very personally to kelly the words were an admission of guilt implicating not just the st germains but also hundreds of tribal members to whom they were related as chairman he felt that he had a sacred duty to protect the tribe from invasion by a group of people that he would eventually argue weren t even native americans i m in a war he told me later sketching family trees on the back of a copy of the tribe s constitution this is our culture not a game the st germains rejected application proved to be a turning point for the nooksack separately the family and the council began combing through nooksack history which like that of many tribes in the united states is complicated by government efforts to extinguish assimilate and relocate the tribe and by a dearth of historical documents an international border drawn across historically nooksack lands only adds to the confusion there were some records and even some living memories of the ancestors whose nooksack heritage was being called into doubt but no one could agree on what the records meant in january 2013 kelly announced that after searching through files at the bureau of indian affairs office in nearby everett he had reason to doubt the legitimacy of more than 300 enrolled nooksacks related to the st germains all of whom claimed to descend from a woman named annie george born in 1875 in february he canceled the constitutionally required council meeting saying it would be improper to convene when rudy st germain and another council member rudy s cousin michelle roberts were not eligible to be part of the tribe they d been elected to lead a week later he called an executive session of the council but demanded that st germain and roberts remain outside while the rest of the council voted on whether to initiate involuntary disenrollment for them and 304 other nooksacks including 37 elders the resolution passed unanimously it hurt me terry st germain said later even harder was watching the effect on his brother rudy it took the wind right out of him two days after the meeting the tribal council began sending out letters notifying affected members that unless they could provide proof of their legitimacy they would be disenrolled in 30 days word and shock spread quickly through the small reservation the disenrollees now calling themselves the nooksack 306 hired a lawyer and vowed to contest their expulsion i told em i know where i belong no matter what you say u2009 an woman who in her youth had been punished for speaking indian at school said u2009 you can t make me believe that i m not u2009 the nooksacks who want the 306 out of the tribe say they are standing up for their very identity fighting for the integrity of a tribe taken over by outsiders we re ready to die for this kelly would later say and i think we will before this is over outside the lands legally known as indian country membership and enrollment are such blandly bureaucratic words that it s easy to lose sight of how much they matter there to the 566 federally recognized tribal nations the ability to determine who is and isn t part of a tribe is an essential element of what makes tribes sovereign entities to individuals membership means citizenship and all the emotional ties and treaty rights that come with it to be disenrolled is to lose that citizenship to become stateless it can also mean the loss of a broader identity because recognition by a tribe is the most accepted way to prove you are indian not just nooksack but native american at all efforts to define native american identity date from the earliest days of the colonies before the arrival of white settlers tribal boundaries were generally fluid intermarriages and alliances were common but as the new government s desire to expand into indian territory grew so too did the interest in defining who was and who wasn t a real indian those definitions shifted as the colonial government s goals did mixed blood indians for example were added to rolls in hopes that assimilated indians would be more likely to cede their land later after land claims were established more restrictive definitions were adopted in the 19th century the government began relying heavily on blood quantum or degree of indian blood wagering that over generations of intermarriage tribes would be diluted to the point that earlier treaties would not have to be honored u2009 as long as grass grows or water runs a phrase that was often used in treaties with american indians is a relatively permanent term for a contract the ojibwe author david treuer wrote in a 2011 for the times u2009 as long as the blood flows seemed measurably shorter even for those early rolls though determining blood quantum was tricky it was not a measure that tribal people used or something they kept track of government agents compiling base rolls in the 1800s sometimes simply guessed at the percentage of indian blood at the time anthropologists used feet and hair width as a scientific test of blood degree in indigenous tribes many traditionalist indians known as irreconcilables or blanket indians were so suspicious of the government that they refused to be enrolled at all making all their descendants unenrollable as well in 1988 the historian kent carter coined a term for the millions who claim indian ancestry but who for a variety of reasons don t sort neatly into today s official boxes people with mixed tribal heritage people whose ancestors were denied recognition by early government agents or died before registration was complete people whose tribes in the face of the federal government s attempts to extinguish them didn t maintain the cohesion that same government would later require for recognition carter called them the outalucks contemporary indian identity is refracted through a tangled accumulation of and understandings of biology and race as well as several centuries worth of conflicting federal policies the constitution uses the word indian twice but never bothers to define it a congressional survey in 1978 found that in addition to the different requirements used by tribes and individual states federal legislation defined native americans in at least 33 ways in 2005 one frustrated judge quoting an earlier decision described the legal definitions of as u2009 a complex patchwork of federal state and tribal law which is better explained by history than by logic given the web of criteria courts are sometimes called upon to decide whether individuals or even tribes are authentically indian this has led to weighing things like whether 128ths constitutes a significant degree of indian blood a federal court ruled in 2009 that it did whether someone who was indian in an anthropological or sense was also indian for the purposes of criminal jurisdiction if his tribe isn t federally recognized the ninth circuit court of appeals decided he was not and whether behaviors like eating fast food and driving cars show that a tribe s culture had been abandoned and its land rights extinguished in 1991 a canadian court said that they did the ruling was later overturned modern native americans who in 2017 are still issued cards by the federal government certifying their degree of indian blood are used to if not necessarily comfortable with the need to prove their identities in ways that may seem strange to people of other ethnicities tribes set their own membership requirements but in order to be recognized by the federal government they must also prove their historical continuity and have generally hewed to the methods it has established tribes have on occasion been warned that federal recognition and thus their rights can disappear if their membership becomes unclear when in 1994 the blackfeet nation considered doing away with its requirement a bureau of indian affairs official warned that a tribe that diluted its relationship with its members might find that it has its sovereignty away today most tribes use direct descent from tribal members listed on historical rolls and blood quantum for a 2003 book real indians identity and the survival of native america the cherokee scholar eva marie garroutte interviewed native people about what it felt like to be defined in this way many said they saw blood quantum as a helpful guidepost and a guard against fraud or against people who identify as indian without cultural understanding others regarded it as odd even offensive an ojibwe man joked that he is also part white but i don t have the papers to prove it a woman replied i don t like being talked about in a vocabulary usually reserved for dogs and horses lately though old debates about identity have taken a harsh new direction loss of tribal acceptance which was once rare and seldom permanent has become increasingly common over the last two decades david wilkins a professor of american indian studies at the university of minnesota who has followed the phenomenon since the says there has been a surge in disenrollment that involves between 5 000 and 9 000 people in 79 tribes across 20 states even the dead have been disenrolled and in some cases exhumed from their graves against tradition and taboo to have their dna tested the ejection of tribal members is most prevalent in small tribes with casinos on their land per capita profit shares go further when split fewer ways many of the most famous cases have been in california following the opening of a new tribal casino in 2003 the chukchansi in coarsegold disenrolled more than half of approximately 1 600 tribal members and battles among factions eventually led to an armed takeover of the casino but disenrollment also happens where casino money isn t a major factor the nooksack have one casino and another recently closed but don t make enough money from gaming to issue per capita payments or isn t a factor at all as in tribes where factions hope to consolidate political power or settle grudges or simply believe that people were mistakenly let in robert williams chairman of the indigenous peoples law and policy program at the university of arizona told me that some tribes have recently begun to hire membership consultants to help trim their rolls it s almost become an industry in some parts of indian country he said the national native american bar association issued a resolution in 2015 denouncing loss of membership without due process while the association of american indian physicians warned that such loss of identity could cause serious grief and depression in general though the voices against disenrollment have been few a 1978 supreme court decision santa clara pueblo v martinez held that due to its sovereignty a tribe cannot be sued for discrimination for accepting the children of male members who married outside the tribe but not those of female members who did it has been widely interpreted as giving tribes the right to determine their membership requirements even if individual rights are compromised the bureau of indian affairs out of respect for sovereignty has repeatedly declined to intervene in internal membership disputes native leaders leery of inviting scrutiny that could undermine tribal sovereignty have been reluctant to speak out they tend to view any interference in such matters as an intrusion of the thin end of an infinitely expandable wedge against which they must exercise constant vigilance writes garroutte ron allen the chairman of the jamestown s klallam a western washington tribe that disenrolled six members for insufficient blood quantum says that the topic is rising and eliciting strong emotions but it s not appropriate to tell other tribes what to do it would be like oregon saying to washington you re not managing your affairs properly u2009 of the sweeping lands that historically made up nooksack territory it once stretched from the glaciated heights of mt baker to the rocky shores of puget sound the tribe now owns about 2 500 acres bought from private owners in the last 50 years the reservation is centered in deming an unincorporated town of a few hundred people with pockets of tribal housing scattered beyond it most nooksack tribal members do not live on the reservation many of them or their ancestors followed opportunities in the more developed southern sound or in other parts of the country adelina 64 lives across the sound closer to the olympic mountains a of annie george the common ancestor who unites the nooksack disenrollees and a cousin of rudy and terry st germain s mother she was among the first of the 306 accepted as nooksack decades ago one afternoon as we sat on her porch watching ships come and go from seattle she showed me the letter the tribe sent her in 1983 announcing her new membership overhead a bald eagle wheeled inside her husband a painter made sketches for a portrait of annie george he was working from an old grainy photograph that he wasn t sure depicted george a relative found it in a shed and the features were indistinct once you title something he said laughing it is what you say it is after she got her letter of acceptance recalled she was quick to tell her family and then to write back to the enrollment director we were all jubilant laughing full of joy jumping screaming crying and the greatest overwhelming feeling of belonging somewhere she was proud she wrote to finally know where she came from and prouder still to be a nooksack indian didn t set out to be a member of the nooksack tribe she grew up well south of nooksack lands following her parents as they sought work in the fields orchards and canneries of washington state her father was filipino and her mother was indian raised on a shxway reserve in british columbia her mother always said she was part shxway a canadian band within the stolo nation through her grandfather and part nooksack through her grandmother annie george annie george s three daughters s grandmother and her two aunts all married filipino farmworkers the family spoke halkomelem a native language that was widely spoken in what is now british columbia but also in the nooksack river valley until the century it eventually largely replaced the original nooksack language lhechalosem as a child would sometimes drive north with her mother to visit family and they would stop off in nooksack territory to visit a man they called uncle louis in 1983 her mother and one of her decided they wanted to learn more about their heritage they went to the bureau of indian affairs office in everett wash and then to the nooksack enrollment office in deming to work on a family tree s mother told the enrollment director that her grandmother s name was annie george and that her grandmother s siblings had been named louis amanda frank and william annie george wasn t on the family trees the tribe had and she wasn t listed on any of the censuses it used but louis george was on a nooksack tribal census from 1942 in a probate document they found annie s name four interviewees described her as louis s half sister the enrollment director encouraged the women to apply for membership and they did within a month the council sent them word that they had been accepted was the 777th enrolled member of the nooksack tribe many of her relatives quickly followed some also enrolled separately as shxway as more houses became available more members of the three families moved to reservation lands before long the descendants of annie george became an influential voting bloc and their members were being elected to council seats and hired to run tribal offices while some elders welcomed them others were skeptical the sisters had never lived on nooksack land some elders had no memory of them others remembered them visiting but thought of them as shxway kelly heard indirectly that elders in british columbia didn t remember the sisters being born there but rather showing up suddenly as young children the beginning of his suspicions that though they had teachings the sisters weren t annie s real daughters at all but children she had taken in roberts showed me copies of two of the sisters birth certificates reissued later in their lives listing annie and her husband as their parents other members of the tribe remembered knowing some of the 306 further south in the 1950s when their families were doing agricultural work at the time they said the families identified as filipino they certainly hadn t been around in the 1960s or 70s when the tribe was writing its constitution when as kelly put it the council took a look around at who was here when they passed it and they wrote their criteria for that based on who was here this is who nooksack s going to be the debate continued into the 1990s when the tribe did an enrollment audit of one of the three families descended from annie s daughters the rabangs they were ultimately found to be enrollable but not before an ugly confrontation in 2000 after a number of rabangs were arrested for smuggling marijuana into the united states from canada some elders told the associated press that a clan of outsiders masquerading as nooksacks was controlling tribal government bob kelly now calls and the other first enrollees from her extended family trojan horses the nooksack as is the case with many tribes have not always been known by their modern name rather nooksack which is also rendered noxwsá7aq was the name of one of many villages scattered along what is now called the nooksack river when white settlers arrived in the century they applied the name of the village to all the people in the valley noxwsá7aq translates to always bracken fern roots on which people of the village are said to have subsisted during a time of famine one tribal member told me that she thinks the name captures something of what it means to be nooksack it makes her feel like a survivor that s a fair description of nooksack history especially in the last few hundred years for centuries the people fished their own river valley but also traveled regularly including to what is now canada s fraser river to fish for salmon or gather shellfish they intermarried and formed alliances with their neighbors on both sides of what is now an international border when white settlers arrived and introduced new diseases many of the nooksack died by some counts their numbers plummeted to 450 from perhaps 1 200 in the 1855 treaty of point elliot in which coast salish tribes ceded their lands to the federal government in exchange for small reservations and the right to continue fishing hunting and gathering the nooksack received no reservation instead as settlers moved onto their lands they were told to go live with the lummi in their new reservation by the coast most refused of those who remained some filed homestead claims on their own lands others scattered in search of a livelihood for the next hundred years as far as the federal government was concerned the tribe essentially ceased to exist this is not an unusual story the federal government used the law as a mighty pulverizing engine to break up the tribal mass as teddy roosevelt said to congress in 1901 he was referring to the general allotment act under which tribally owned land was carved into small parcels and handed out to individuals it was a huge blow to the stability and sovereignty of tribes within 20 years native people lost ownership of 90 million acres it was also the beginning of the government s reliance on blood quantum to determine indian status those deemed or less were regarded as more responsible and given more freedom to handle their land even many progressive reformers saw assimilation into white society as the best way to transform tribal members into citizens kill the indian in the student so we can save the man went the famous slogan of a superintendent at one of the 500 boarding schools that native children forcibly separated from their families were made to attend some nooksack people unrecognized by the federal government stayed on their lands and continued to operate as a tribe in the 1920s they joined other northwest tribes to sue the federal government for lands lost in the 1930s even though they weren t considered eligible to participate they voted to accept the indian reorganization act in which the government backed away from its assimilationist policies and instead encouraged tribes to be and a decade later the united states ended its relationships with tribes and returned to promoting assimilation before changing its policies and pushing again in the 1960s a committee of nooksacks opened a bid for federal recognition they gained title to one acre of land in deming the first nooksack reservation in 1970 and full federal recognition in 1973 like many tribes they adopted a constitution based on a model that the bureau of indian affairs developed during the reorganization period in the 1930s the new constitution restricted nooksack membership to recipients of early land allotments recipients of a 1965 government settlement or people who appeared on a 1942 tribal census their direct descendants could also be enrolled provided they had at least degree indian blood the nooksack weren t alone in seeing applicants turn up after the tribe was officially recognized ron allen the tribal chairman of the jamestown s klallam told me it was common in the last decades of the 20th century for the communities of northwestern tribes to be surprised by a wave of people who started coming back to places their families once left he credits the political advancement of tribes which made members of the broader society feel that it was o k to be indian tribes generally welcomed the new arrivals he said but still it was like where are all these indians coming from u2009 the most outspoken critics of disenrollment call it a form of genocide others don t go quite so far but still view the practice as an outgrowth of policies designed to suppress native american identity to control us to assimilate us and ultimately to extinguish us as john mccoy a washington state senator and member of the tulalip tribes neighbors to the nooksack wrote in an for the indian country media network earlier this year robert williams of the university of arizona argues that disenrollment is a remnant of colonialism and good american racism with indians left to deal with the mess in a 2015 tweet sherman alexie the spokane and coeur d alene author put it even more emphatically dear indian tribes who disenroll members you should be ashamed of your colonial and capitalistic bullshit the first person to reply to alexie s tweet thanking him for speaking out when others were silent was gabe galanda a member of the round valley indian tribes in california and the lawyer whom the nooksack 306 hired to represent them the next replies came from some of galanda s other clients former members of the confederated tribes of grand ronde who were disenrolled in 2014 grand ronde was formed in 1857 when the federal government forced at least 27 tribes and bands to leave their homelands which ranged from california to washington and move to a reservation in oregon the 86 grand ronde disenrollees descend from a man known as chief tumulth who signed one of the treaties that created the reservation decades after they enrolled tribal officials noted that chief tumulth failed to appear on the official base roll made the year it was founded it was true he was hanged the year before by a lieutenant of the u s army i thought of this last spring as i watched leaf through old letters and family trees newspaper clippings and documents we didn t make the laws she said we just got stuck in the middle after the first disenrollment letters went out to nooksack members galanda appealed to tribal courts and the department of the interior and managed to delay the disenrollment hearings meanwhile the 306 tried to make sense of what documents they could find to illuminate their past they had no birth certificate for annie so they turned to old censuses and to church records kept by the archdiocese of vancouver marking the sacraments of birth marriage and death they found that annie s birth mother marie siamat was buried in december 1875 two days after giving birth to annie and that her father variously recorded as chief matsqui george kot kro itmentwh george roelkwemeldon george tekwomclko george matsqui and so on remarried a woman named madeline jobe indian censuses taken during annie s childhood repeatedly recorded her living with george and madeline michelle robert s grandmother remembers her mother annie referring to madeline as the woman who raised her and as mother the 306 think this is compelling evidence madeline adopted annie the council remains unconvinced kelly says that citing madeline as an ancestor their only tie to recognized base rolls was a blatant lie if madeline didn t count the family responded they should still qualify for membership under section h of the nooksack constitution which allows the enrollment of persons who possess at least ¼ indian blood and who can prove nooksack ancestry to any degree records indicate that matsqui was considered a nooksack village even after the canadian border was established to the south and matsqui george was a chief of the village in a u s census from 1910 louis george indicated that both his parents madeline and matsqui george were nooksacks from washington and that he was a nooksack besides the 306 like to point out kelly s own family was adopted by the nooksacks it is originally from a different canadian tribe kelly suggested that the 306 disenroll themselves and reapply under section h but he soon called for a referendum to remove section h from the nooksack constitution he said later that this change was unrelated to the 306 and was instead a tightening of loose enrollment laws that could have let almost anybody in the amendment passed with 61 percent support as part of their defense the 306 produced letters from anthropologists one cited not just the requirements for nooksack membership provided in tribal code but historical documents family oral history and concepts of identity affiliation and membership within anthropology regarding the social organization of the coast salish peoples but for some tribal members this only served to undermine his case it s not a club a woman named mary brewer who recently gave up her membership in the lummi tribe to enroll as a nooksack told me my mom has about 10 different tribes in her ancestry and she meets the requirements for only two their family lost title to 80 acres on the yakima reservation because they didn t have high enough blood quantum to be enrolled there they were sorry to lose the land she said but respected the rules by which modern tribes operate brewer s mother diane said she had two grandchildren whose blood quantum is we ve been telling them better marry native or else it ll die out she said the 306 say disenrollment isn t traditional u2009 mary said well enrollment was never traditional it is however the way things work now it s not this guy took care of me and that s how we did it in the olden days u2009 brewer continued if you don t have documentation then you re not indian in more than 30 years of membership annie s descendants became interwoven in the life of the tribe they married other nooksacks and had kids those kids had kids but once the disenrollment process began people chose sides it was just like a light switch elizabeth oshiro one of the 306 told me people she knew for years all of a sudden had a different heart with the hearings repeatedly delayed as lawsuits made their way through the tribal court system both sides formed facebook groups to argue their cases and regularly debated or taunted each other online their competing slogans were we belong and we are nooksack while some people challenge the idea of tribal enrollment referring to it as western thinking and an imposed system on american indians posted katrice romero the tribe s housing director that tribal enrollment number is what holds the united states government accountable to the american indian people and its trust responsibility to tribes a responsibility that my ancestors fought struggled and sacrificed for on the reservation michelle roberts found that people who babysat for her as a child or attended her wedding would no longer make eye contact with her the most important thing isn t friendship says diane brewer who no longer speaks to her former best friend one of the 306 the most important thing is the tribe in the summer of 2013 roberts was fired from her job as the manager at the nooksack river casino later when she tried to count the number of disenrollees and their allies who lost tribal jobs she got to 58 at first kelly told me he wouldn t comment on personnel decisions but later said we got rid of all them a long time ago rudy st germain was fired from his job as the casino s landscaping manager and had to move his two boys into a relative s house when he couldn t make rent those were dark days he told me today he works in a plant roberts and st germain couldn t find resolution in the council kelly began insisting that meetings be held over the phone he d received threats he said and it wasn t safe to meet in person when st germain and roberts spoke no one seemed to be able to hear them i asked kelly whether he muted them he shrugged and said probably i muted a lot of people he says they weren t supposed to be on the call in the first place the following winter kelly scheduled the first council meetings in months on the friday saturday and monday of martin luther king jr day weekend the nooksack constitution allows for council members to be removed from office if they miss three monthly council meetings in a row st germain and roberts who were out of town tried to reach the council by phone or email at the third meeting the council declared their seats empty and appointed two new members to replace them it was the only way we could get them off council kelly told me later rudy said i was lost for words by that time kelly was calling the 306 scam artists nobody stepped forward and claimed them he told me repeatedly you don t show up and just insert yourself into someone else s family tree with an election looming and four of eight council seats expiring the council asked the tribal court judge to keep pending disenrollees from voting after the judge refused the council declined to schedule the elections the incumbents remained in office but some argued that without an elected quorum the tribe had no viable government several lawsuits including one called kelly v kelly brought by a group that included the chairman s sons were filed to force elections but amid litigation the council abruptly fired the tribe s judge the council also barred galanda from practicing in the tribe s courts saying he d behaved unethically by citing an opinion he wrote while serving as a judge for another tribe the court began to return all of his filings unopened an appellate court directed the chief of police to arrest and imprison the court clerk if she continued to reject filings when the chief of police refused the appellate court held him in contempt began levying a fine of 1 000 a day and wondered in its ruling if at nooksack the rule of law is dead the council contends that because the courts are under the jurisdiction of the council these fines and rulings are meaningless two of the remaining council members whose seats did not expire and who have resisted disenrollment one is the mother of kelly s sons and is now married to one of the 306 were targeted with petitions calling for their recall one of the recalls succeeded the charge was treason in july some of the disenrollees and their allies scheduled what they called a general council meeting to avoid the tribal police they met on the grounds of an old logging show several people showed me text messages they received from tribal employees who said they d been warned that they would be fired if they attended later thinking kelly might consider the meeting a kind of coup i asked him what he thought of it he shrugged it was meaningless he said it s not real it s george adams who taught lhechalosem language classes for the tribe until he was fired early last year he s such a fervent supporter of the 306 that he likes to call himself 307 called the meeting to order he spoke in lhechalosem though he is considered the only remaining fluent speaker he learned the language by studying old recordings a quarter century after the last native speaker died adams charged four witnesses with committing the proceedings to memory in order to later share what happened remember these names he told the crowd because this is how we survived for thousands of years people rose to speak my enrollment number is six so there you go said one man by way of introduction another said i m 71 years old and i m kind of ashamed to call myself a nooksack right now years ago our people never asked where you from they welcomed you to their table a woman asked how the decisions of this council could be considered valid when there were so few people around 200 present people began to speak of shutting down the tribe altogether to force the bureau of indian affairs which had consistently declined to intervene to call new elections adams asked for a vote the crowd decided that the four expired seats on the tribal council were vacant that everything the government had done since the canceled elections was invalid and that they should vote in four new officers none of them disenrollees from their own ranks this has to do with 10 generations from now one of the newly elected officers said he described the scenario for lots of people to be cut off from the tribal community to be just a person roaming around trying to figure it out for themselves the new treasurer bernadine roberts a short woman stand up please adams told her oh you are standing who enrolled three years after the tribe was officially recognized told me that until she moved to the reservation from seattle she was one of those urban indians that didn t know much she gave a brief acceptance speech about what it meant to her to reconnect to her family s past my grandmother said we were going home and i didn t know what she was talking about she said but i know now in july after the meeting at the logging show some of the nooksack 306 joined in the intertribal canoe journey an annual event in which hundreds of members from dozens of northwest tribes spend weeks paddling the coast to and from one another s lands for meals dancing and ceremonies they named their canoes with seating for 15 for annie s daughters and shared them with people of the shxway band some nooksacks told me this was ridiculous the sharing with the shxway the names participating at all the nooksack they said are known for racing narrow fast war canoes not paddling wide traveling canoes near the end of the journey the canoes crossed puget sound and came to shore on a sandy beach in seattle george adams in the center canoe stood and addressed two elders from the muckleshoot tribe which was hosting that day we are all one he said carrying on the tradition of knowing who you are and where you come from the following month the 306 celebrated what they saw as a hopeful precedent when the grand ronde tribal court of appeals overturned the disenrollment of chief tumulth s descendants holding that it was unfair to subject tribal members to such an extreme sanction after accepting them for nearly three decades elsewhere a few tribes have rejected disenrollment altogether the federated indians of graton rancheria in california amended their constitution to ban disenrollment in 2013 the spokane tribe of washington did the same in 2015 as part of more than two dozen constitutional changes meant to better reflect the historical complexity of the tribe but the nooksack dispute dragged on in october the bureau of indian affairs informed kelly that it would not recognize any actions of the tribal council because it failed to hold elections in march 2016 stressing that it wasn t telling the tribe who counted as a member but simply responding to the exceedingly rare situation of a council s lacking a quorum the tribe scheduled new elections and certified the results of a referendum to disenroll the 306 but the bureau would not recognize the results by excluding pending disenrollees from voting the tribe had violated its constitution and the rulings of its court of appeals so when the 306 received letters informing them that their disenrollment hearings had finally been scheduled to take place on the phone in november they weren t sure what to do some including rudy st germain refused to participate on the grounds that the hearings were illegitimate others scheduled their appointments then called in to tell the council they didn t recognize its authority michelle roberts called from canada where she was staying with shxway friends annie george was nooksack because her father was matsqui george and he was nooksack she said we are all nooksack i am nooksack i can t say that more and mean it more a voice came on the line it was bob solomon who holds one of the expired council seats and is a descendant of madeline jobe i have never heard anybody say that you were adopted by madeline jobe you are not my relative through madeline yes we are roberts said her voice rising the document proves it my grandmother proves it the oral history proves it that s your story he said that s not mine a week later the day before thanksgiving kelly announced that the tribe had removed the names of who had been erroneously enrolled in the tribe from its membership list those who called and those who didn t all were gone it s finally over he wrote but of course it wasn t over the departments of housing and urban development and health and human services which enforce the government s treaty responsibilities to provide housing and health care to the tribe did not recognize the disenrollment of the 306 and maintained they were still entitled to their services in late december the bureau of indian affairs warned that the tribe s failure to hold valid elections put all its federal funding at risk there were now two sides offering two competing realities each telling the other it was illegitimate the 306 would be another chapter in the long strange history of who decides who is and who isn t an indian ',\n",
       " 'with its grasslands and oppressive heat the middle of the namib desert may seem like a strange place to go fishing yet there jennifer guyton and tyler coverdale were standing in a sea of orange sand and brittle yellow grass with their carp pole but the two princeton graduate students weren t trying to catch some sort of dogfish or a literal sand shark that would be absurd instead they had swapped the hook with a camera so they could investigate the scenery around something much more scientifically sensible fairy circles that is what scientists call the mysterious bald spots speckled across namibia s grasslands the rings are six feet to 115 feet wide and are regularly spaced out in a hexagon or honeycomb pattern as their ethereal name would imply fairy circles have long bewildered researchers as to their origins but a new study published on wednesday in the journal nature that ms guyton and mr coverdale were involved in seeks to offer some insights into how the enchanting landscapes may have formed although the name fairy circles sounds sweet and peaceful there is passionate scientific disagreement over how they arise and the two prevailing hypotheses have become adversaries in the dispute one side suggests that termites locked in competition with neighboring colonies create the circles as they fight for dominance and resources the other says that perpetually thirsty plants simultaneously assist and compete with their neighbors roots causing the vegetation to into the patterns the new study suggests that termites and plants may be jointly responsible for forming fairy circle landscapes in namibia and it has received mixed reviews from scientists entrenched in the dispute we thought both sides of the debate bring in compelling arguments for each of these mechanisms so why should it be one or the other said corina tarnita an ecologist from princeton university and the study s author dr tarnita worked with juan bonachela a mathematician from the university of strathclyde in scotland to test the termite and plant explanations in a computer model they found that either hypothesis could generate the fairy circle features but when they tested both mechanisms together the model revealed a second smaller pattern hidden within the clumps of grass between the fairy circles everyone was focusing on the circles and not what was happening in between them said robert m pringle an ecologist at princeton and another author on the paper the next step for the team was to confirm that this second vegetation pattern existed in nature so they sent ms guyton and mr coverdale to namibia in 2015 with their camera and fishing pole ms guyton said that each of the grassy patterns was as different as fingerprints but were mathematically similar by comparing the photos with their model the team verified that the second pattern did exist in the grass surrounding the namibian fairy circles that finding they said confirmed that their mathematics reflected reality and suggested that only by interacting together could insects and plants create the landscape that characterizes namibian fairy circles some fairy circle experts firmly placed in either team termite or team plant had strong doubts about the paper s findings while others welcomed it norbert juergens a biologist from the university of hamburg in germany who published the study that said termites engineer fairy circles agreed with the overall findings and said that he hoped they would be an for all those who since 2013 questioned the termite hypothesis stephan getzin an ecologist at the helmholtz centre for environmental research in leipzig germany was not persuaded saying in an email that the paper was unable to account for the presence of fairy circles where sand termites were completely absent as in australia logically if there are fairy circles without the presence of termites the termite theory cannot be considered as a strong explanation for the phenomenon he said dr tarnita responded that their model showed that both termites and plants could make the fairy circles but that the entire system which includes the vegetation and the patterns seen in the namibian fairy circles needed both walter r tschinkel a retired entomologist from florida state university who was not involved in the study said in an email that the assumptions the team made about termites in their computer model were untested there is no evidence that the real termite psammotermes allocerus does what the computer termite does he said but max rietkerk an environmental scientist from utrecht university in the netherlands said that the authors showed that the two hypotheses could have worked together in namibia s fairy circles he also agreed however that the argument could use more empirical evidence dr pringle defended the use of their model pointing out that it drove the team to discover new empirical evidence that no one had found before the grass patterns despite the team s attempt to solve the mystery it seems the fairy circle scuffle flutters on ',\n",

       " 'how much do inaugural addresses matter many are memorable and continue to be quoted while most others are forgotten almost immediately donald j trump will get his chance shortly after noon friday they are a touching almost naïve attempt to set a tone for what is to come jon meacham the presidential biographer said but as we know and as is often remarked events are in the saddle we are not some of history s most notable inaugural speeches including the first of abraham lincoln in 1861 demonstrated that presidents cannot control the tides of history but even so the most memorable ones stand as worthy introductions to the presidents who delivered them their values and their goals george washington thursday april 30 1789 the first inaugural address was characterized by the first president s impressive humility professing himself to feel unworthy of the task and praising god george washington used the speech which james madison helped him to draft to declare his faith in congress s ability to govern the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications could not but overwhelm with despondence one who inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies he said essentially announcing his skepticism and fear at not living up to the task but while he declined to offer any specific legislation to congress as was his right under the new constitution he did subtly remind the legislative body of its duty toward the new country asking that the foundation of our national policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality and the of free government be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the affections of its citizens and command the respect of the world then before praising god at length for a final time washington announced that he would decline any financial compensation for taking on the role of president andrew jackson wednesday march 4 1829 president jackson was one of the originators of american populism and fittingly his inaugural address paid tribute to his supporters the people while the magnitude of their interests convinces me that no thanks can be adequate to the honor they have conferred it admonishes me that the best return i can make is the zealous dedication of my humble abilities to their service and their good he said jackson s speech stands as a notable example of the gulf that can exist between rhetoric and action he pledged to respect the limits of executive power which he ended up expanding and expressed his sincere and constant desire to be humane and considerate regarding native american rights he signed the indian removal act which expelled tens of thousands of native americans from their native homes into law the following may jackson who had been elected during a time of economic anxiety had far more to say about policy than did washington he discussed the extinguishment of the national debt and devoted many words to the maintenance of military might but he too ended his speech on a humble note looking to god and his fellow elected officials for support as well as his fellow citizens abraham lincoln monday march 4 1861 though he promised at the outset that it would be brief abraham lincoln used his first inaugural address one of the more momentous and memorable of all such speeches to speak at length about the grievances between north and south that would erupt into civil war a month later lincoln attempted to soothe southern states saying that he had no intention of interfering with the institution of slavery and that he believed not only that states should be in charge of their own institutions but also that it is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend that they do so after addressing the question of fugitive slaves at length he went on to prosecute those who would see the country split saying that the south had no right to rend the country in half and cautioning patience before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric with all its benefits its memories and its hopes would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence of course his plea was futile and the country plunged into war in april when confederate troops fired on fort sumter in south carolina four years later about a month before the confederate general robert e lee surrendered lincoln gave his second inaugural it was far shorter john f kennedy friday jan 20 1961 john f kennedy s inaugural address contains his most memorable spoken sentence my fellow americans ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country but the speech is more than a simple call to duty as the united states was facing a rival superpower in the soviet union kennedy used the speech to address a newly interconnected global community pledging that his country was committed to human rights today at home and around the world and seeming to address the soviet union and its allies directly kennedy delivered a call for harmony and a warning against nuclear apocalypse to those nations who would make themselves our adversary we offer not a pledge but a request he said that both sides begin anew the quest for peace before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental ronald reagan tuesday jan 20 1981 in contrast to kennedy ronald reagan was firmly fixated on the domestic problems plaguing the nation after acknowledging the routine transfer of power as nothing less than a miracle he went on to bemoan the economic ills affecting the united states saying that government is the problem and announcing his aim to curb the size and influence of the federal establishment government can and must provide opportunity not smother it foster productivity not stifle it he said only after declaiming the steps he sought to take to to reduce government did he look outward saying that once america regained strength at home it could project that strength abroad and then toward the end of his speech reagan continued a tradition that stretched back to washington he said he believed that god intended for us to be free and declared that inauguration days in the future should be observed as days of prayer he ended his speech uniting the themes of economic ills and providential help saying that the crisis the united states faced required americans best effort he said that what was required was belief our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in our capacity to perform great deeds to believe that together with god s help we can and will resolve the problems which now confront us ',\n",
       " 'janet l yellen the federal reserve chairwoman made it clear wednesday that she believes that the american economy is pretty much back on track and that in turn sets the stage for a potential conflict with the incoming trump administration in the months and years ahead congress assigns the fed two goals seek maximum employment and maintain stable prices ms yellen in a speech in san francisco rather explicitly made clear that the nation isn t far from attaining those goals now it s fair to say the economy is near maximum employment and inflation is moving toward our goal she said the unemployment rate 4 7 percent is back near where it was before the 2008 recession and although inflation has been running below our 2 percent objective for quite some time we have seen it start inching back toward 2 percent last year it is ms yellen s clearest indication to date that the era of extraordinary efforts by the central bank to get the economy back in shape is nearing its end the fed has raised interest rates in each of the last two decembers and it is looking likely that there will be more than one rate increase this year she said in her speech that she and her colleagues were expecting to increase the federal funds rate a few times a year as central bankers are wont to do ms yellen emphasized that those plans were contingent on the economy s behaving as the fed expected if inflation starts to slip again or improvements in the job market recede the fed will presumably hold off but she spoke clearly of the risks of moving too slowly toward the neutral interest rate that neither stimulates nor slows the economy waiting too long to begin moving toward the neutral rate could risk a nasty surprise down the road she said either too much inflation financial instability or both but if things go as planned there is a clear risk that the fed s goals could be on a collision course with the trump administration s goals the and his advisers have often spoken of seeking stronger economic growth than the united states has experienced the last several years perhaps seeking 3 5 percent to 4 percent instead of the percent growth that has been the standard since 2009 a white paper by advisers to mr trump released in the fall assessed the view that this lower growth rate reflected demographics and that it amounted to a new normal and declared it incomplete and unnecessarily defeatist that view is at odds with both ms yellen s comments wednesday and economic projects that fed officials have released for example the median fed policy maker viewed the economy s rate of g d p growth as only 1 8 percent a year very much in the ballpark that trump advisers would view as unnecessarily defeatist so here s one way things could go the fed steadily raises rates to the degree that employment and inflation data cooperate with their forecasts with faster rate increases the higher growth rises it s possible that what people in mr trump s orbit view as a desirable boom will look to ms yellen and her colleagues as overheating and prompt equal and opposite interest rate increases there are a couple of potential twists in this story the first would involve potential trump appointments to the fed the second could involve big moves in the dollar ms yellen s term as chairwoman expires in about a year mr trump could appoint a new leader to the fed who is more hospitable to his view though she would have the option of continuing her time as a fed governor one of seven policy makers who are appointed to terms there are two governor vacancies available now so mr trump could quickly influence the direction of the fed with new appointees but it s not clear whether any new trump appointees would steer the bank toward higher interest rates and greater concern about inflation or let a potential trump boom advance unconstrained big fluctuations in the dollar could also shape a potential tension between trumponomics and fed policy economists believe a key element of a corporate income tax overhaul advanced by house republicans known as a border adjustment tax would have the effect of creating a huge rally in the value of the dollar compared with other major currencies perhaps 20 percent or more the fed has been more focused than ever in the last few years on how its decisions ripple through the global economy it held off on rate increases in 2015 and early 2016 in significant part because a rally in the dollar seemed to be destabilizing many emerging markets and fueling risks of a global slowdown a stronger dollar also reduces inflation in the united states which in turn makes the fed more inclined toward caution on rate increases mr trump has sent mixed messages on his views of a border adjustment tax seeming to slap down the idea in a wall street journal interview published this week but if it looks as if policies on capitol hill are going to push the dollar up significantly of course that too could cut in the other direction a stronger dollar doesn t help with mr trump s goals of reducing the trade deficit and just this week he has seemed to try to talk the dollar down add up a week of new signals from incoming trump administration officials and now ms yellen s speech and it is looking like a distinct possibility that ms yellen could wake up one morning in the year ahead to tweets directed her way originating from 1600 pennsylvania avenue ',\n",

described by the contemporary poet susan howe in the catalog for an exhibition i m nobody who are you the life and poetry of emily dickinson opening on friday at the morgan library museum the show is one of the largest gatherings ever of prime dickinson relics and it comes with an aura the size of a city block it instantly turns the morgan into a pilgrimage site a literary lourdes a place to come in contact with one aspect of american culture that truly can claim greatness which we sure can use in an political moment the show has a mission to give audiences a fresh take on dickinson gone is the puritan nun and that infantilized charmer the belle of amherst at the morgan we get a different dickinson a person among people a member of a household a a citizen she was born in 1830 to rural gentry in western massachusetts and one of the earliest items in the show gives an impression of modest yankee privilege it s a portrait of dickinson at around age 10 with her older brother austin and young sister lavinia done by a local artist otis allen it s sort of a big deal to have it here this is the first time it has left houghton library at harvard since it arrived there in 1950 and the morgan displays it well against wallpaper that replicates the original only recently uncovered in emily s amherst bedroom in a sweet coincidence the roses on the paper echo the flower the holds in her portrait as the daughter of a her father edward was elected to the united states congress in 1853 and a lifelong consumer of newspapers and periodicals dickinson had a good sense of what was happening in the world she went to grammar school and was a bookworm but had friends and a poised dry sense of humor as some teasing early letters to her brother suggests in 1847 she spent a year as a boarding student at mount holyoke female seminary her one stint in higher education and from that time came what many devotees will consider the exhibition s star attraction the daguerreotype of the dickinson with her pale skin and eyes it s another rare visitant it last left home at amherst college in 1986 and it s almost a shock to see how small it is like a holy card or a talisman dickinson said that she liked mount holyoke but i don t know it had its stresses part of the curriculum was religious with students expected to make a profession of faith before graduating the school informally divided potential candidates into three categories those who would readily comply those who would need some persuasion and to whom they paid special attention dickinson who had developed an allergy to orthodoxy was a and proud it s important in presenting a revisionist view of her especially a normalizing one to note that from the start resistance was her natural mode and one that grew increasingly pronounced and eventually acute the end of her schooling signaled the start of a new phase of her life she was again at home and beginning to work in a serious way on poetry which required concentration and a degree of isolation a commitment the willingness i guess you could say to make a vow i think it wasn t easy the 1850s were a period of personal tumult her school friends had dispersed several had married among them was susan gilbert with whom she had forged a tight emotional and intellectual bond and whom she relied on as a first reader and editor of her poetry in 1856 gilbert there s a picture of her here married austin and lived with him in the house next door to the family homestead by 1858 dickinson had accumulated enough poems to begin collecting them in handwritten booklets known as fascicles and from around this time comes what is thought to be another portrait a daguerreotype that surfaced in 2012 and is on public view at the morgan it s a portrait of two seated women the one on the left tentatively identified as dickinson the other one as her friend and possible romantic partner kate scott turner in the show it s placed side by side with the earlier authenticated photograph the dickinsons in each with their candid unguarded gaze share a clear if inconclusive resemblance and her pose in the dual portrait is extremely moving far from being the timid removed figure of myth she looks directly at the camera and reaches in a to touch the back of her friend much of dickinson s poetry from this time has an experimental incendiary flair images of combat and violence occur it s as if she were experiencing the civil war before it happened and when it did happen her production soared oddly in the midst of the conflict war was rarely her active theme but like walt whitman who began working as the equivalent of a psychiatric nurse in a military hospital in washington dickinson seems to have been caught up in the atmosphere that gripped the nation a mood probably not entirely different from the one found in a divided america now whitman was permanently shaped by the war and its waste whether dickinson was i don t know but when it was over her life changed she began to withdraw communication was through writing letters as intricately composed as puzzles notes as brief as tweets poems sent out like gifts the primary relics from this time forward are her manuscripts of poems nearly 1 800 survive 24 examples are in the show organized by mike kelly head of archives and special collections at amherst college and carolyn vega assistant curator in the morgan s department of literary and historical manuscripts the manuscripts come with questions of legibility dickinson s penmanship grew eccentric over time as did her compositional methods transcribing her work has become a complex science particularly in the matter of rendering the alternative phrases and words she included in drafts it was as if she were deliberately creating poems that demanded reader participation poems that could be endlessly rewritten and maybe as her conviction grew that she would always be her own best audience she turned poems into art objects sculptures and pictures a draft of a poem that begins the way hope builds his house is composed on a bit of paper an envelope flap shaped like a house in the show s catalog aptly titled the networked recluse the connected world of emily dickinson the art historian marta werner analyzes the visual nature of the manuscripts yet what matters most in dickinson is the element most easily passed over in an exhibition words and they warn us whenever we focus on them against trying to normalize dickinson against trying to make her acceptable and explicable she was an outsider and as such a disrupter was she a feminist not in the modern sense though an idea of female power as a protean force was central to her thinking as it was to the writers she loved emily brontë elizabeth barrett browning george eliot central too was her disdain for the false power of churches fathers governments god ego even her most poems like the one for which the show is named slice away at that power this little anthem to outsider solidarity delivered with a lift is both cute and furious a joke and a call to arms some of its references translate neatly into the present of ethical bogs pepe the frog a new its paranoia is of the moment too for many with a grain of otherness in their makeup dickinson did as a woman who said no to a culture that wanted her to be a wife a mother a social creature on its terms when she had other plans and to pursue them she assumed the guise of a nobody invisible independent ignoring the knock on the door the fringe for her was a position of strength not deprivation this truth should not be lost in the rebranding campaigns periodically conducted on her behalf nor should it be forgotten that defending difference took a lifelong fight one which she was willing and able supremely able to wage that s a revolutionary talking and her voice carries subaudibly explosive through this show ',\n",
       " 'washington donald john trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the united states on friday ushering in a new era that he vowed would shatter the established order and reverse a national decline that he called this american carnage in a ceremony that capped a remarkable rise to power mr trump presented himself as the leader of a populist uprising to restore lost greatness he outlined a dark vision of an america afflicted by the ravages of economic dislocation and foreign exploitation requiring his approach to turn around i will fight for you with every breath in my body and i will never ever let you down mr trump told hundreds of thousands of admirers and onlookers in a forceful inaugural address from the west front of the capitol america will start winning again winning like never before we will bring back our jobs we will bring back our borders we will bring back our wealth and we will bring back our dreams mr trump s ascension amounted to a hostile takeover of a capital facing its most significant disruption in generations while officially a republican he has taken on leaders of both parties and with no prior political career of his own made clear that he saw himself as the ultimate outsider not beholden to the current system we will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action constantly complaining but never doing anything about it he said the time for empty talk is over now arrives the hour of action do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done mr trump s view of the united states was strikingly grim for an inaugural address a country where mothers and children are trapped in poverty in our inner cities where factories are scattered like tombstones across the landscape and where drugs and crime have stolen too many lives this american carnage he declared stops right here and stops right now he got started right away with rolling back the policies of his predecessor former president barack obama by issuing orders freezing new regulations from recent weeks and ordering agencies to ease the burden of the affordable care act during the transition from repealing to replacing the law more orders are planned for next week wearing a dark suit and red tie and accompanied by his wife melania in a suit and matching gloves mr trump took the oath administered by chief justice john g roberts jr precisely at noon michael richard pence a former governor and congressman from indiana was sworn in minutes before as vice president by justice clarence thomas mr trump assumed the presidency of a country still unsettled after a polarizing election and entered office with less support in polls than any other president in recent history it was clear from the day that there would be no grace period either for or by the new president the senate confirmed two cabinet nominations james n mattis as defense secretary and john f kelly as secretary of homeland security but democrats temporarily held up mike pompeo s confirmation as c i a director throughout the day there were mostly peaceful protests against the new president sporadic violence broke out as demonstrators smashed shop windows and burned a limousine while police officers in riot helmets responded with tear gas more than 200 people were arrested liberal groups prepared for a women s march on saturday that they said could draw hundreds of thousands mr trump made only passing efforts to reach out to democrats beyond thanking mr obama and his wife michelle for their handling of the transition they have been magnificent he said in his speech he later praised his defeated opponent hillary clinton at a luncheon with congressional leaders asking her and former president bill clinton to stand for applause i have a lot of respect for these two people he said democrats were not impressed i was pretty shocked by how dark it was senator sherrod brown democrat of ohio said of mr trump s inaugural address i love this country and i don t understand how a president of the united states that loves his country could paint a picture of its failures he added it was interesting sitting up onstage with a bunch of billionaires hearing him say how bad the country was the national mall was filled with supporters many wearing make america great again hats and chanting trump trump trump but the lingering animosity from the presidential campaign was on display too when mrs clinton arrived some in the crowd chanted lock her up mimicking mr trump s campaign rallies as he took the oath a cluster of people blew whistles and screamed not my president before being escorted out while large the crowds on a soggy day did not rival the energetic throngs at mr obama s first inauguration eight years ago according to aerial photographs the washington metrorail system recorded fewer than half as many rides on friday morning as in 2009 and knots of bystanders along the inaugural parade route were not as thick in a city that gave just 4 percent of its vote to mr trump many residents left town and about 60 house democrats boycotted the event mr obama made his exit after the ceremony flying by helicopter to joint base andrews in the maryland suburbs where he thanked former aides and members of his administration before boarding the presidential jet no longer designated air force one to fly to palm springs calif for vacation he will return to washington to a rental house while his daughter sasha finishes high school the first president to stay in the capital since woodrow wilson hours before his departure mr obama posted on twitter to thank followers and hint that he would not fade away i won t stop he said i ll be right there with you as a citizen inspired by your voices of truth and justice good humor and love former vice president joseph r biden jr and his wife jill rode an amtrak train to delaware and the home they have there but they too planned to return at least part time to washington where mrs biden teaches at a community college in the virginia suburbs the united states has never seen a president quite like mr trump the son and grandson of immigrants who grew up to become a real estate magnate casino owner beauty pageant operator and reality television star whose tumultuous love life played out in the tabloids never has the oath been administered to a president who had never served either in public office or as a general in the military at age 70 mr trump became the oldest president sworn in for the first time and the first born in new york since franklin d roosevelt he was also one of the wealthiest presidents ever to enter the white house with business connections that have already raised questions about where his interests end and the country s begin he arrived in the oval office dogged by reports about russian interference in the election on his behalf but mr trump overcame skeptics when he embarked on what seemed like a quixotic bid for the presidency an ivy mogul who lives in a new york tower named after himself with an living room he transformed himself into the unlikely leader of a movement anchored in rural areas far removed from the coasts his bracing candor disregard for convention and willingness to offend whole sections of the population to make a point came across as refreshing to many americans disenchanted with washington elites for the nation s 58th inauguration though the untraditional president opted to follow tradition he and mrs trump a former model from slovenia who became the first first lady since john quincy adams s wife louisa started the day with a service at st john s episcopal church adjacent to lafayette square then joined the obamas bidens and pences for coffee at the white house from there the two presidents shared a limousine to the capitol where three other presidents waited mr clinton jimmy carter and george w bush all of whom opposed mr trump s election former president george bush remained hospitalized in houston recovering from pneumonia but a spokesman said he watched the ceremony on television mr pence 57 was sworn in at 11 54 a m placing his hand on ronald reagan s bible which was held by his wife karen as their three adult children michael charlotte and audrey watched for his oath mr trump placed his hand on two bibles held by his wife one given him by his mother in 1955 just before his ninth birthday and another used by abraham lincoln in 1861 and again by mr obama in 2009 and 2013 standing nearby were his adult children from two previous marriages donald jr eric ivanka and tiffany also there was barron his son with the first lady joining them was ivanka s husband jared kushner who will serve as an unpaid senior adviser as mr trump approached the podium rain began to fall it was not a conventionally republican speech with nothing about tax cuts or restraining government instead he laid out a protectionist agenda saying his rule will be buy american and hire american he did pledge to eradicate from the face of the earth islamic terrorism responding to charges that he demonized mexicans and muslims mr trump said there is no room for prejudice mr trump said the inauguration was not merely the transfer of power from one president to another we are transferring power from washington d c and giving it back to you the people he said for too long he continued a small group in our nation s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost washington flourished but the people did not share in the wealth he added that all changes starting right here and right now ',\n",
       " 'washington america and the world just found out what america first means president trump could have used his inaugural address to define one of the touchstone phrases of his campaign in the most inclusive way arguing as did many of his predecessors that as the world s greatest superpower rises its partners will also prosper instead he chose a dark alternative one that appeared to herald the end of a american experiment to shape a world that would be eager to follow its lead in mr trump s vision america s new strategy is to win every transaction and confrontation gone are the days he said when america extended its defensive umbrella without compensation or spent billions to try to lift the fortune of foreign nations with no strategic benefits for the united states from this day forward it s going to be only america first he said in a line that resonated around the world as soon as he uttered it from the steps of the capitol we must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products stealing our companies and destroying our jobs the united states he said will no longer subsidize the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military while all american presidents pledge to defend america s interests first that is the core of the presidential oath presidents of both parties since the end of world war ii have wrapped that effort in an expansion of the liberal democratic order until today american policy has been a complete rejection of the america first rallying cry that the famed flier charles lindbergh championed when in the late 1930s he became one of the most prominent voices to keep the united states out of europe s wars even if it meant abandoning the country s closest allies mr trump has rejected comparisons with the earlier movement with its taint of nazism and after world war ii the united states buried the lindbergh vision of america first the united nations was born in san francisco and raised on the east river of manhattan an ambitious if still unfulfilled experiment in shaping a liberal order lifting the vanquished nations of world war ii into democratic allies was the idea behind the marshall plan the creation of the world bank and institutions to spread american aid technology and expertise around the world and nato was created to instill a commitment to common defense though mr trump has accurately observed that nearly seven decades later many of its member nations do not pull their weight mr trump s defiant address made abundantly clear that his threat to pull out of those institutions if they continue to take advantage of the united states willingness to subsidize them could soon be translated into policy all those decades of generosity he said punching the air for emphasis had turned america into a loser we ve made other countries rich he said while the wealth strength and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon the american middle class has suffered the most he said finding its slice of the american dream redistributed across the entire world to those who helped build that global order mr trump s vow was at best shortsighted truman and acheson and everyone who followed based our policy on a not an basis said richard n haass whose new book a world in disarray argues that a more granular view of american interests will ultimately fail a narrow america first posture will prompt other countries to pursue an equally narrow independent foreign policy he said after mr trump s speech which will diminish u s influence and detract from global prosperity to mr trump and his supporters it is just that view that put america on the slippery slope to obsolescence as a builder of buildings mr trump s return on investment has been easily measurable so it is unsurprising that he would grade america s performance on a scorecard in which he totals up wins and losses curiously among the skeptics are his own appointees his nominee for defense secretary gen james n mattis strongly defended the importance of nato during his confirmation hearing both rex w tillerson the nominee for secretary of state and nikki r haley the choice for ambassador to the united nations offered up paeans to the need for robust american alliances though mr tillerson periodically tacked back to concepts echoing mr trump s and there is a question about whether the exact meaning of america first will continue to evolve in mr trump s mind he first talked about it in a march interview with the new york times when asked whether that phrase was a good summation of his views he thought for a moment then he agreed with this reporter s summation of mr trump s message that the world had been freeloading off of us for many years and that he fundamentally mistrusted many foreigners both adversaries and some allies correct he responded then he added in his staccato style not isolationist i m not isolationist but i am america first so i like the expression he soon began using it at almost every rally in another interview with the times on the eve of the republican national convention he offered a refinement he said he did not mean for the slogan to be taken the way lindbergh meant it it was used as a very modern term he said meaning we are going to take care of this country first before we worry about everybody else in the world as walter russell mead a professor at bard college and a scholar at the conservative hudson institute put it the other day the fact that he doesn t have a grounding in the prior use of the term is liberating if you said to the average american voter do you think it s the job of the president to put america first they say yes that s the job but mr mead said that formulation disregarded the reality that sometimes to achieve american interests you have to work cooperatively with other countries and any such acknowledgment was missing from mr trump s speech on friday mr trump cast america s new role in the world as one of an aggrieved superpower not a power intent on changing the globe there was no condemnation of authoritarianism or fascism no clarion call to defend human rights around the world one of the commitments that john f kennedy made in his famed address delivered 56 years ago to the day to protect human rights at home and around the world that was of course the prelude to kennedy s most famous line that america would bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty but the america that elected mr trump had concluded that it was no longer willing to bear that burden or even to make the spread of democracy the mission of the nation as george w bush who was sitting behind mr trump vowed 12 years ago mr trump views american democracy as a fine import for those who like it we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone he said but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow ',\n",

on friday he is less popular than any new president in modern american history according to a series of surveys published in recent days the numbers suggest that rather than unifying a divided electorate his transition to power has continued the polarization from the campaign polls released on tuesday by cnn and orc and by the washington post and abc news found that just 40 percent of americans approved of the job mr trump has been doing during the transition mr trump s aides say they have had that atmosphere in mind while planning the week s festivities more than 60 democrats in the house of representatives said they would not attend the ceremony many of them citing mr trump s recent criticism of representative john lewis a civil rights icon a security bubble has encircled much of downtown washington as almost 30 000 local state and federal officials work to ensure that the transfer of power goes off without a hitch the authorities began enforcing a soft and a hard perimeter in central washington in the early hours of friday morning and other road closings around the region followed only local vehicles were allowed within the soft perimeter no civilian vehicles could pass inside the hard perimeter where federal security forces were screening anyone hoping to enter by foot to assure security many items including backpacks and posters are prohibited on the capitol grounds along the parade route and at the inaugural balls the national park service decided on thursday to allow small umbrellas onto the national mall and parade route because of rain in the

around the country more than 8 000 people will march behind the president and vice president according to the presidential inaugural committee including representatives of each branch of the american armed services as well as high school college and police bands that have volunteered to perform this year s parade is expected to be considerably shorter about 90 minutes than those celebrating mr trump s recent predecessors it will also pass a certain conspicuous building that bears the name of the 45th president come nightfall many of the inaugural revelers will dress in their best evening

       " 'in an interview with cnn on wednesday night thomas barrack jr who heads the presidential inaugural committee was asked whether kanye west who vocally supported donald j trump s candidacy last year and who visited him in trump tower in december following his victory would be performing at any of the inaugural events we haven t asked him mr barrack replied rather than stop there he continued it s not the venue the venue we have for entertainment is filled out it s perfect it s going to be typically and traditionally american following a political season in which quarrels over inclusion and exclusion in the united states in senses literal metaphorical and philosophical were central and heated the make america great again welcome celebration was an opportunity to make a loud case the stage was a potent one the national mall in washington just beneath the lincoln memorial the concert was broadcast live on cnn and online what was presented as typically and traditionally american however veered between jingoism and vaudevillian fluff and largely ignored the contribution of to popular music which is to say almost all of popular music instead it focused heavily on country and rock by white southerners including the country superstar toby keith who has been the nation s loudest musical cheerleader for a decade and a half the mississippi band 3 doors down which was a favorite in the 2000s and the frontmen of country an amalgam of singers made famous in other bands it was a spotty lineup though not a wholly ineffective one 3 doors down s songs remain sturdy and the frontman brad arnold s voice was strong though denuded of its sleazy edges and mr keith the headliner in a heavy overcoat and a scruffy beard delivered potent patriotism via strong narratives mr keith isn t as uncomplicated a choice as he might appear from a distance in the past he s been a registered democrat and here he thanked president obama for his service before offering a salute to mr trump mr keith s career soared after when his music took an aggressive turn at this show he played the pugnacious and proud courtesy of the red white and blue the angry american and also american soldier a meditative embrace of patriotic dedication he also played beer for my horses with its endorsement of vigilante justice take all the rope in texas find a tall oak up all them bad boys hang them high in the all the people to see mr keith s songs about america are very conscious of place and at this show that proved an effective strategy the frontmen of country leaned heavily on songs that mentioned bucolic southern settings god blessed texas amy s back in austin walking in memphis and lee greenwood joined them for god bless the u s a a dour march of national pride in total the concert s message was that america is a defined geographical and ideological space with borders worth defending even at the price of excluding those who could make the place immeasurably more fun this concert ended up being as notable for who did not show up as for who did the only featured nonwhite performers were sam moore of the 1960s soul duo sam dave who sang a restrained america the beautiful backed by an choir and dj ravidrums who delivered his dim caffeinated percussive interstitials from inside a spherical drum kit but both of those acts got just a couple of minutes the united states army old guard fife and drum corps got much more time for their songs when mr trump first appeared onstage at the show accompanied by his wife melania it was to the rolling stones s heart of stone a song about a man who can t be swayed at the end of the concert mr trump addressed the crowd briefly thanked the performers and suggested that hosting this event in front of the lincoln memorial might have been an unprecedented choice that was not true in 2009 mr obama held a concert here we are one the obama inaugural celebration at the lincoln memorial it included athletes actors and musicians from across genres mary j blige singing bill withers s lean on me pete seeger and bruce springsteen singing this land is your land a song of acceptance and respect for the nation it was a show of cosmopolitanism and inclusion that portrayed america not as a fixed idea but as an sum ',\n",
       " 'after eluding prosecution in the united states for decades and escaping from prison twice in mexico the crime lord joaquín guzmán loera better known as el chapo appeared on friday in federal court in brooklyn and pleaded not guilty to charges that he had overseen a drug empire prosecutors said the operation had moved at least 200 tons of cocaine into the united states had earned 14 billion in profits and had been protected by an army of assassins who killed thousands of people mr guzmán s arraignment in federal district court was both a news media spectacle and a pro forma counterpoint to his sudden extradition from mexico on thursday afternoon when a police jet flew him from the border to macarthur airport in islip on long island the brief court proceeding took place under tight security with police vehicles heavily armed guards and dogs patrolling the grounds outside the courthouse dressed for his arraignment in a blue blue pajama pants and blue sneakers mr guzmán 59 stood with his lawyers in front of magistrate judge james orenstein in a courtroom packed with prosecutors federal agents and reporters are you mr guzmán judge orenstein asked the defendant sí señor mr guzmán said the judge then asked mr guzmán if he understood the charges he was facing sí señor he said again those charges had been detailed earlier on friday at a news conference at the briefing robert l capers the united states attorney in brooklyn called the extradition of mr guzmán whose nickname means shorty a milestone in the pursuit of a trafficker who achieved mythic status in his homeland as a robin outlaw and a serial prison escapee saying that mr guzmán now faced life in prison on a charge of running a continuing criminal enterprise mr capers sought to play down mr guzmán s role as a folk hero and promised that he would not escape his american jailers who is chapo guzmán mr capers said flanked by a phalanx of officials from local state and federal agencies in short he is a man who has known no other life than one of crime violence death and destruction even at a courthouse that has seen the prosecution of mafia dons like john j gotti the onetime gambino family boss and corrupt public officials like meade esposito the former brooklyn democratic leader the arrival of mr guzmán sent a charge through the building where scores of international reporters were on hand in an extraordinary confluence of events mr guzmán was taken from mexico by plane on the eve of the inauguration of donald j trump and was arraigned in brooklyn only hours after mr trump was sworn in after the hearing he was returned to the metropolitan correctional center in manhattan a federal jail that has housed some of new york s federal defendants including many facing terrorism charges as the day began prosecutors in brooklyn issued a memo laying out their arguments for keeping mr guzmán in custody they noted his vast wealth and asserted his propensity for violence and his penchant for escaping mexican prisons most notably the altiplano prison where he lived in isolation under surveillance nonetheless he managed to flee after his associates dug a tunnel directly into his shower speaking at the news conference angel m melendez the special agent in charge of homeland security investigations in new york said he had been at the airport thursday night when mr guzmán arrived mr melendez said he looked into mr guzmán s eyes and saw surprise shock and even a bit of fear now that he was facing american justice mr guzmán s escapes in mexico came while he was serving a long sentence on offenses although officials at the gathering refused to discuss details about security measures mr melendez said i can assure you no tunnel will be built to his bathroom mr guzmán is facing charges in six federal districts and mr capers said the decision had been made to prosecute him in brooklyn with the assistance of federal prosecutors in miami because the two offices working together could bring the most forceful punch to the case against the leader of the sinaloa cartel mr capers added that cases in texas in california in illinois and elsewhere would for the moment remain open the investigation into mr guzmán s crimes was conducted by a host of agencies including the drug enforcement administration and the federal bureau of investigation in its memo filed friday mr capers s office said it would seek a criminal forfeiture of 14 billion against mr guzmán and announced that it planned to call dozens of witnesses to testify about the staggering scope of mr guzmán s criminal enterprise its shipments of drugs in trucks planes yachts fishing vessels container ships and submersibles as well as its numerous killings of witnesses law enforcement agents public officials and rival cartel members the memo also said the government had a vast array of physical evidence including seized drug stashes and electronic surveillance recordings the memorandum of law supplemented with photographs of seized drugs and the planes boats and submersibles used to smuggle them reads like a history of the modern narcotics business prosecutors contend that mr guzmán transformed the drug trade with unchecked brutality remarkable efficiency and brazen corruption the document tracks his progression from the 1980s as a smuggler who transported colombian cocaine to the united states and returned the profits to traffickers there so efficiently that he earned the nickname el rápido through the 90s when he began consolidating his control in mexico as colombian traffickers faced increased enforcement of extradition laws and thus greater threat of prosecution in the united states they ceded elements of the distribution networks in the united states to mexican cartels according to the memo as mr guzmán s operations grew prosecutors say they became increasingly sophisticated mr guzmán also established a complex communications network to allow him to speak covertly with his growing empire without detection by law enforcement according to the memo this included the use of encrypted networks multiple insulating layers of and methods of communicating with his workers mr guzmán also established distribution networks in new york new jersey georgia illinois texas and california and created massive efforts that delivered billions of dollars in illegal profits generated from the cocaine sales in the united states to the mexican traffickers and their colombian partners the memo said these changes it added enabled guzmán to exponentially increase his profits to staggering levels ',\n",
       " 'the legal record shows that jerry hartfield s first murder conviction was thrown out on appeal and for the next 32 years he was not officially guilty of anything not sentenced to anything yet he spent that time in texas prisons in what an appellate court now calls a criminal justice nightmare he was finally tried and convicted again in 2015 but on thursday mr hartfield moved closer to freedom than he has been in decades a state court of appeals ruled that he was not only denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial but to a degree the court had neither seen nor imagined before it noted that the important precedents dealt with delays of three years six years eight years not 32 the panel dismissed the indictment against mr hartfield who is developmentally disabled in effect erasing the recent conviction but it is still not clear whether or when he will get out of prison prosecutors could appeal thursday s ruling to the court of criminal appeals texas highest criminal tribunal the state attorney general s office which has argued against mr hartfield referred questions to the matagorda county district attorney s office which did not reply to requests for comment we are deeply mindful that our conclusion today means that a defendant who may be guilty of murder may go free judge gina m benavides wrote for the court of appeals however based on the united states constitution it is the only possible remedy all told mr hartfield now 60 has spent more than 40 years behind bars for the murder of a bus station ticket clerk his case can seem like something out of absurdist fiction a court ruling ignored or forgotten an appeal dismissed by a court that agreed with the substance but said it had been filed under the wrong statute a retrial after most of the evidence had been lost and witnesses had died and an argument by prosecutors that mr hartfield himself was to blame for the delays and caused them intentionally once you call this kafkaesque you can t really call anything else kafkaesque because there s nothing else remotely like this said david r dow of the university of houston law center one of the lawyers who represented mr hartfield on appeal this was the perfect storm of everything that could go wrong with the criminal justice system on sept 17 1976 eunice lowe a white woman was killed where she worked the continental trailways station in bay city southwest of houston the killer bashed in her head with a pickax stole money from the station and took her car and there was evidence of sexual assault after death mr hartfield a black man signed a confession that he later disavowed and crucially investigators said he told them where to find ms lowe s car experts placed his i q in the 50s or 60s which his lawyers contend made him easily coerced by detectives and unable to understand his rights or his confession a jury convicted him and he was sentenced to death but the court of criminal appeals later overturned that verdict ruling that a potential juror had been improperly dismissed for having doubts about the death penalty and ordered a new trial after years of legal wrangling the high court ruling took effect in march 1983 under texas law at the time prosecutors had a way to avoid a retrial and preserve the conviction but only if they acted within a time frame set by the court because the trial error had to do with capital punishment if the governor commuted the sentence to life in prison then it would be as if the appellate court had never ruled and the guilty verdict would remain in effect that was apparently never communicated to the prison system mr dow said that mr hartfield thought he was awaiting a new trial but did not have the capacity to understand the delay or what to do about it whether the district attorney s office understood what had happened at the time is unclear but it never took steps to retry him and the case lay dormant for the next 23 years prosecutors have argued that mr hartfield had legal representation all along because his original defense team remained his lawyers of record until a court formally dismissed them in 2013 but mr hartfield s new lawyers say he had no legal counsel from 1983 when the original team thought they were done with the case until a federal court appointed a lawyer in 2008 starting in 2006 a fellow inmate helped mr hartfield file motions in various courts some were rejected outright and at least one apparently went to the wrong office one federal judge ruled in his favor but another said he had to keep trying in state court finally in 2013 texas court of criminal appeals ruled that mr hartfield s conviction and life sentence were void but his motions were also void the motions were filed under a law applying to people who have been convicted the court said and there was no valid conviction on record in his case he refiled under a different provision and prosecutors finally sought a new trial mr hartfield s lawyers said the charges should be dismissed because he was denied a speedy trial prosecutors argued that while the government was negligent the defendant was partly to blame for the delays for more than two decades they said he acquiesced in his imprisonment without trial as a ploy to avoid the death penalty and to make it harder to mount a case against him the supreme court ruled in 2002 that intellectually disabled people cannot be executed the district attorney s office was able to locate just one of the 16 evidence exhibits used at the original trial several witnesses had died and at least one had dementia the murder weapon was lost along with blood and semen samples that could have yielded dna ms lowe s car no longer existed but the trial court ruled that the case could proceed and in 2015 38 years after his first trial mr hartfield was convicted again and sentenced to life in prison if that sentence were counted from the start of his time in prison he would have been eligible for parole long ago if he is released based on thursday s ruling he would probably live with one of his two sisters mr dow said i m not sure if he knows about this ruling yet mr dow said i think it s unlikely he really understands it very well ',\n",
       " 'one night nearly 140 years ago samuel clemens told his young daughters clara and susie a bedtime story about a poor boy who eats a magic flower that gives him the ability to talk to animals storytelling was a nightly ritual in the clemens home but something about this particular tale must have stuck with clemens better known as mark twain because he decided to jot down some notes about it the story might have ended there lost to history but decades later the scholar john bird was searching the twain archives at the university of california berkeley when he came across the notes for the story which twain titled oleomargarine mr bird was astonished to find a richly imagined fable in twain s inimitable voice he and other scholars believe it may be the only written remnant of a children s fairy tale from twain though he told his daughters stories constantly it s impossible to know why twain did not finish the tale or if he ever intended it for a wider audience now more than a century after twain dreamed it up oleomargarine has taken on a strange new afterlife after consulting a few other scholars mr bird brought the text to the attention of the mark twain house and museum in hartford which sold it to doubleday books for young readers this fall doubleday will release the purloining of prince oleomargarine an expanded version of the story that was fleshed out and reimagined by the children s book team of philip and erin stead from twain s spare the steads created a illustrated story featuring talking animals giants dragons a kidnapped prince and a wicked king while the original work has a timeless quality the steads added a postmodern twist twain himself makes an appearance in the book to argue with the author philip stead about the direction the story takes finishing a partial manuscript by one of the country s most revered writers was terrifying at times the steads said we said yes before our brains could tell us it was a terrible idea and we would never be able to do it mr stead said in a telephone interview from the couple s home studio in northern michigan erin stead who did the illustrations said they were very aware of the creative risks involved in taking on the work of such a towering literary figure we both just tried to approach the text respectfully and with as much reverence as possible she said no one s qualified to write for mark twain oleomargarine is the latest abandoned children s tale to resurface decades after a revered writer s death in recent years publishers and estates have dug deep into the archives of beloved children s book authors in search of partial manuscripts and castoff gems and have released previously unpublished works by dr seuss beatrix potter and margaret wise brown twain s story may hold even greater literary significance for scholars and fans because it represents a new genre for him while he wrote fiction essays journalism travelogues short stories and satire he never published fiction for very young children apart from his translation of a german fable it certainly wasn t for a lack of ideas as twain describes in his journals his daughters constantly demanded he make up stories on the spot they often gave him an image from a magazine or another visual prompt to use as inspiration sometimes they would insist that his stories mention every knickknack on their living room mantel beginning with a painting of a cat and ending with a portrait of a young girl they were a difficult and exacting audience those little creatures he wrote of his daughters in his journal the stories had to be absolutely original and fresh like an artifact from a lost civilization oleomargarine gives a tantalizing glimpse of the wild ephemeral tales that twain spontaneously created for his daughters each night in the period when he was working on adventures of huckleberry finn scholars haven t found any written remnants of those stories apart from oleomargarine which suggests twain thought it might hold lasting appeal for a wider audience he had at least some inkling that it might be publishable said robert hirst the editor of who is mark twain and the curator of twain s papers at berkeley a vast archive of more than 500 manuscripts mr bird stumbled on the manuscript in 2011 when he was searching the twain archives for food references for a mark twain cookbook the word oleomargarine sounded as if it could be part of a recipe what i found is what seems to be the only remaining record of these bedtime stories that he told his kids mr bird said the manuscript was just 16 handwritten pages long and unfinished it opens as a poor starving boy named johnny is given a magic seed which grows into a flower he eats it and discovers he can understand animals johnny and the animals go on a quest to rescue prince oleomargarine who has been kidnapped by giants and taken to a cave guarded by dragons at one point twain scribbled down a suggestion that his daughter susie made when she asked if the kangaroo was the hostess after finding references to bedtime stories about a boy named johnny in twain s journals mr bird theorized that twain had probably told this story to his daughters while the family was in paris in 1879 johnny was a recurring character in the nightly tales for the clemens girls at least for a while in a diary that twain kept about his daughters he described how they lost interest in johnny after the character told a lie johnny s days of usefulness were over he was up a stump i had to leave him there twain wrote at first mr bird was unsure what to do with the fragmentary text after talking to mr hirst and a few other scholars he decided that the story offered a significant new perspective on twain s domestic life and work and that it should be published it s a testament to his incredible powers of invention said mr bird a professor of english at winthrop university in south carolina he wrote his own version which closely followed twain s blueprint and incorporated his language and took the idea of publishing it to cindy lovell who was then the executive director of the mark twain house and museum but mr bird s version which hewed to the original was never published doubleday which acquired rights to the story from the twain house decided to hire the steads who are stars in children s publishing to finish the story what we ended up with is this wonderful story inspired by twain s unfinished manuscript which makes any twain purist uneasy ms lovell said mr stead secluded himself in a cabin on beaver island in the middle of lake michigan and wrote the first draft of the story in a feverish nine days he often found himself arguing with twain about the changes he wanted to make and found the imagined conversations so compelling that he put them in the book to capture a rhythm that mirrored twain s natural speaking voice mr stead read the first and second volume of twain s autobiography which twain had dictated i tried to approach the project as a piece of oral history mr stead said this was a story that twain told his daughters and now he s going to tell it to me and now i m going to tell it ',\n",
       " 'i repeated it to myself as if it were a mantra stay on the left stay on the left but the thoughts continued that s not the turn signal dummy the turn signal is on the side you just turned the wipers on remember the transmission is on your left careful here comes a roundabout stay on the left stay on the left it was an first 45 minutes to say the least from the time i picked up my rental car outside melbourne airport to when i settled in and relaxed at least slightly driving in australia like driving in london or hong kong means driving on the side of the road and if you ve never done it before it can take a little bit of adjusting i was determined to make the effort as this road trip had a particularly appealing payoff i had just finished a whirlwind tour of melbourne s street art scene and had another day in town and i was resolved to spend it on the great ocean road considered by many to be one of the world s most beautiful scenic drives beginning in torquay a seaside town about 60 miles southwest of melbourne and ending in the town of allansford to the west the road is 150 miles of winding coastline towering cliffs lush forests fascinating wildlife and incredible views of southern victoria the construction of the great ocean road dates back to the end of world war i when returning soldiers set to work on the project the mayor of geelong about 14 miles north of torquay had set money aside for the project which was intended to employ veterans and also commemorate those who had died in the war over a decade later the route was finally completed both a practical civic improvement and what may be the world s largest world war i memorial indelibly carved into the rocky coastline after leaving torquay the first contact with the ocean comes in the small town of anglesea a stiff wind and a small cloudburst caught my little suzuki as i entered town setting off my shaky nerves i took a deep breath and reminded myself that i d at least gotten the insurance on the rental car the strong sun had but the breeze took the edge off the heat and the ocean air was sharp in my nose i grabbed a snack at the oaks bakery cafe a chunky prawn and scallop hand pie with a hot flaky crust for 6 50 australian dollars about 4 85 in the parking lot some friendly wild cockatoos were hanging around scavenging for dropped food i parked on a dirt road near seventh avenue a little ways from the center of anglesea and from a cliff slightly above sea level was treated to a beautiful view of the beach and ocean cobalt blue in patches sea foam green in others i hiked down the hill through the bush a small forested patch called the lorne queenscliff coastal reserve past native trees and shrubs of common heath soft and manna gum trees oh and flies everywhere the flies in australia are relentless they re far more brazen than the meek little house flies in the united states australian flies will land on your face again and again requiring you to constantly wave them off this continual shooing motion is sometimes called the aussie salute at one point i thought i was rid of my companions but when i turned around and peeked at the back of my shirt i saw about a dozen of them hitching a ride you get used to it but i recommend investing in some bug spray the flies eased up once i emerged from the shade of the trees and reached the beach a long swath of sand greeted me along with limpid ocean water and the sound of lapping waves i was the only person on the beach i was already satisfied with this and i d barely gotten started i was satisfied too with how i had started the trip an important decision there is a local airport outside avalon closer than melbourne to the start of the great ocean road that i could have flown into on jetstar an australian airline and rented a car i also considered flying into warrnambool airport sharp airlines services this airport regularly near allansford and driving east instead of west which would have meant renting a car one way and driving it to melbourne but the rental would have cost around 200 dollars more i knew i had to come back to melbourne airport since i was flying out of there early the next morning so i rented a car near the airport through sixt rent a car for 44 australian dollars the insurance policy purely elective but reassuring for those who have never driven on the side of the road not purposely anyway brought the total to around 70 dollars i ended up driving most of the great ocean road in the suzuki then doubling back near lavers hill when it got dark and heading back to melbourne warned by periodic road signs reminding me to drive on the left in australia i continued from anglesea down to aireys inlet stopping to see the split point lighthouse a beautiful massive white pillar against the blue sea the lighthouse was constructed in 1891 after a slew of shipwrecks along the rocky coast i passed on the tour but there are guided 14 dollars and 10 dollars ones available i was feeling more comfortable behind the wheel by the time i arrived in lorne one of the towns to which the great ocean road was intended to ease access i had set off the windshield wipers just once or twice in the previous hour or so and had managed to parallel park with moderate success the drive was even becoming dare i say enjoyable the constant twists and hairpin turns in the road made for a lot of fun i approached a bend in the road in lorne near three majestic conifers and stopped at the imposing grand pacific hotel an 1870s landmark that was originally accessible only by sea i had a cup of tea 4 dollars and a white chocolate macadamia nut cookie 3 dollars i recommend you do what i did take your tea up to the second floor and sit on the balcony the panoramic views even in an area with an embarrassment of visual riches are fantastic a friend had tipped me off about the location of some wild koalas so i made a beeline out of lorne toward kennett river where there is a small park an access road near the appropriately named kafe koala took me into a eucalyptus forest just as a downpour began i had to move fast i trudged up the muddy road looking in the branches of the trees nothing after a bit more walking i heard something a frenetic grunt a noise i imagined a warthog would make i looked up rain pelting my face and saw two fuzzy gray shapes chasing each other up the trunk of a tree with bark koalas and they seemed mad they were spitting and hissing at each other and making incredibly well noises once i noticed these koalas i saw others everywhere perched in tree branches snoozing munching on eucalyptus leaves or chasing one another in playful and ways koalas incidentally are suffering a horrible chlamydia outbreak i still found them adorable but it was time to get out of the rain i zigzagged through a large group of cockatoos and brightly colored crimson rosella parrots and hopped back into the car i was on high alert again on the road and of course when i tried to turn the windshield wipers on i promptly turned on the turn signal i had to pull over to let by a big truck that was riding my tail on the way toward great otway national park i recommend checking out a few of the many places to turn off and enjoy the scenery cape patton lookout point is particularly and bucolic with sweeping views of both the ocean and the surrounding bush and it s not just views access points to the beach are plentiful i spent some quality time on the beach in apollo bay approaching it from gambier street much of what the great ocean road has to offer is simply handed to travelers even just driving it i couldn t help but take in its beauty a few things though are a bit more difficult to get to lighthouses abound in victoria and the cape otway lightstation the oldest working lighthouse in australia and the most important according to the website is worth going the extra mile the lighthouse is far south on the tip of victoria a detour from the main road through the national park the environs changed quickly i was chugging along amid beautiful ocean scenery when suddenly i was in a lush forest just as quickly i was in dry barren bush that looked almost apocalyptic about seven miles after i turned off the main road i made it to the cape and after a moderate hike i was staring at the tiny perfect lighthouse in the distance the area is particularly remote and isolated i encountered only two other people on my detour there s a sense of immense calm about the place and while it s not the southernmost point in australia it feels just as distant from that point on for the rest of my drive along the great ocean road and back to melbourne i felt pretty much at ease no more no more mistakes with the windshield wipers driving on the left wasn t second nature but i had definitely gotten the hang of it ',\n",

foreign military intervention at least 26 000 gambians worried about violence have fled the country the united nations says and several senior officials in mr jammeh s government have resigned in protest or have left the nation as well as the invasion began the winner of the election adama barrow was being sworn into office in a brief ceremony about 150 miles outside of gambia the inauguration took place in a nondescript room at the gambian embassy in dakar senegal because mr barrow has so little control over his country that he did not go home for the funeral of his son who had been killed by a dog over the weekend mr barrow s team ultimately decided that the embassy in dakar was the closest they could safely get to gambian soil to start the new administration plans for an elaborate ceremony in a soccer stadium in gambia s capital had to be scrapped amid the standoff it s not necessarily the kind of ceremony to be jubilant about but the situation is dangerous said halifa sallah a spokesman for mr barrow but late on thursday it appeared the situation could still be resolved without a fight state television broadcast news that the presidents of liberia mauritania and guinea would arrive friday to negotiate a resolution a senegalese military official said troops would stand by for talks during the inauguration in senegal mr barrow arrived to enthusiastic whoops from hundreds of supporters and emerged from a motorcade beaming he was sworn in just before 5 p m his hand on a quran pledging to serve his country without fear or favor several people who had gathered outside to watch on a large television screen shouted no more dictatorship in a brief speech the mr barrow called on the gambian security forces to pledge their loyalty to him asking that the military stay in their barracks we are one gambia one people he said gambia has suffered high unemployment and political repression for years under mr jammeh with many citizens abandoning the country to risk perilous and often deadly journeys to europe by sea minutes after mr barrow was sworn in celebrations erupted across gambia with thousands gathering in some areas lamin demba a welder said he felt like a free man joining others in celebration in front of his welding shop with piles of metal he took out his phone and called a relative in italy come back home boy we are free now he shouted into the phone now gambia is free but while mr barrow has popular support in gambia it has not been enough to dislodge the erratic mr jammeh after initially accepting defeat in the election he suddenly cited voting irregularities and called for a new vote he is still the president said seedy njie gambia s minister of information communication and technology so yes he is here this week gambia s parliament voted to extend mr jammeh s term for three months though international officials denounced the move and many analysts consider it unconstitutional the united nations security council unanimously adopted a resolution on thursday supporting the efforts of the economic community of west african states to ensure a peaceful transfer of power to mr barrow the resolution presented by senegal which has a rotating seat on the council offers its full support to the ecowas in its commitment to ensure by political means first the respect of the will of the people of gambia in the election that ousted mr jammeh from office the speed with which the council has taken action shows how little support mr jammeh has among world powers he has overseen a legacy of human rights abuses including imprisoning opponents and declaring that gay people should be beheaded he has claimed to have the ability to cure aids with little more than an herbal concoction mr barrow by contrast is an unassuming real estate agent who fell into the candidate s position after mr jammeh jailed other opposition party members he left the country last week to meet with west african leaders to discuss how to resolve the matter of taking over the presidency fearing for his safety at home he wound up in senegal which surrounds gambia on three sides and has a huge stake in gambia s stability mr jammeh s circle of friends has been shrinking considerably in recent days the african union said it would fail to recognize him as president as of thursday the presidents of liberia and mauritania met with him to urge him to step down to no avail his chief spokesman and longtime mouthpiece fled the country many of his ministers resigned mr jammeh has tried numerous channels to cling to power he appealed to the supreme court but because he had fired most of the judges and failed to replace them a full panel could not be assembled in time to hear his case this week mr jammeh declared a state of emergency in the country he shut three independent radio stations and his officers arrested people selling gambiahasdecided for now it appears members of the security forces are staying loyal to him but with mr jammeh lacking a broad support base his ability to provide for supporters who have lived off his good graces for years will be challenged he has nothing left really said mr sallah mr barrow s spokesman in the end i don t see how he can stay mariam sakho a gambian waitress in banjul said she was confident that mr jammeh would step down especially now that many of his ministers were deserting him yesterday my boss say i should not come to work because it is not safe she said but for me i believe nothing will happen so i told him i will come everybody is tired with yahya jammeh i believe he will go people stayed glued to radios for news while many barrow supporters celebrated openly nobody can stop me said fatou njie a barrow supporter it is my right ',\n",

       " 'fifty years ago right about now two unassuming young brothers were standing in front of a cbs studio audience taping the first episode of their new variety show they were also about to unleash the modern concept of television buzz in a storm the likes of which the medium had not seen they were the smothers brothers tom and dick and the story of their show the smothers brothers comedy hour is worth recalling 50 years on as a case study that may prove newly relevant as a president with a habit of attacking tv shows via twitter settles into office that first episode taped in late january and broadcast feb 5 1967 wasn t incendiary but some that came later were spectacularly so the brothers inflamed cbs censors and segments of their audience by injecting sexual innuendo drug references religion and especially politics into the typically bland format drawing in season 3 a firing the story of the show can seem the brothers were delivering two things that every network today covets a lot of attention and a young audience why kill that goose the answer lies in the newness of it all in 1967 no one knew quite how to exploit controversy and conversation the way publicists do the series was cbs s latest effort to compete against bonanza the nbc staple that had owned sunday nights for years the brothers had a stage act in which tom on guitar played a dimwit and dick on bass was the straight man the dynamic translated exceedingly well to tv dick smothers now 77 who lives in florida and advocates fitness and balance programs for older people was a bit surprised by the show s popularity at first i didn t think we sang that well he said now i can see the genuineness the whimsy that we had the series was remarkable for its approach mixing established guest stars with newcomers and rock acts a september 1967 installment had bette davis mickey rooney and the who whose finale that night is said to have damaged pete townshend s hearing the multigenerational lineups led to ratings success some weeks the show even outdrew bonanza but the humor content increasingly reflected contentious times and by season 2 clashes with cbs s censors were frequent they had something to offend everybody william h tankersley then the executive in charge of programming standards and practices at cbs said in a 2001 interview with the archive of american television still sounding peeved mr tankersley died last year at 98 they brought more complaints than any show in history on cbs they injected politics up to the sky they refused to do anything that we asked the cbs response though was oddly inconsistent evidence of how uncharted this territory was pete seeger s performance of the antiwar waist deep in the big muddy was cut out of his performance in an early season 2 episode but five months later he was allowed to sing the song what today seems barely saucy would be cut one early battle involved efforts to say frigget instead of ribbet in a frog sketch david bianculli recounts in dangerously funny the uncensored story of the smothers brothers comedy hour a sort of guerrilla war broke out in which banned material would turn up in newspapers including this one as early as april 1967 the new york times reprinted a sketch by elaine may that the network had killed yet some of the material that made it onto the air was pointed enough to raise eyebrows even today a series of sketches in a december 1967 episode for instance mocked the american obsession with guns mercilessly in one bit a contestant was to take shots at three hidden figures in hopes of killing either a stranger a celebrity or his own wife if the network was surprised by the show s success and all the controversy people on the creative side of things were too i was naïve enough to think that nobody was watching except my friends said david steinberg who was then a comedian who had made a few tonight show appearances we didn t know that we were bothering the government in season 3 mr steinberg did one of his satirical sermonettes in which he tweaked religion a subject that television of the day didn t like to touch some time after that appearance he said he dropped by the show s headquarters and tom smothers dragged him to a room that contained a bunch of bulging duffel bags i said what is this mr steinberg recalled and he said it s your hate mail in march 1969 tom smothers asked mr steinberg to do another sermonette although the network had banned the bit that move is often credited with being the last straw though it was just one of many many straws in any case the network fired the smotherses and canceled the show though it was still pulling in decent ratings since those times networks have learned that a certain amount of boundary pushing is healthy politicians have become more adept at manipulating tv and the people on the creative side have begun to understand that being on tv especially in network prime time requires compromises that learning process continues today just ask keith olbermann or bill maher hosts whose mouths have landed them in hot water yet content the thing that got the smothers brothers in trouble is all over prime time even on comedies like and now comes donald j trump who seems to have thin skin the smotherses incurred the wrath of two presidents lyndon b johnson and richard m nixon tom smothers who turns 80 in february said in an interview in 2000 that he had always believed nixon was directly responsible for his show s demise there was a bigger game going on that was beyond our scope of understanding he said who knows what games lie ahead as a twitter president takes office ',\n",
       " 'geneticists tell us that somewhere between 1 and 5 percent of the genome of modern europeans and asians consists of dna inherited from neanderthals our prehistoric cousins at vanderbilt university john anthony capra an evolutionary genomics professor has been combining computation and a medical records databank to learn what a neanderthal heritage even a fractional one might mean for people today we spoke for two hours when dr capra 35 recently passed through new york city an edited and condensed version of the conversation follows q let s begin with an indiscreet question how did contemporary people come to have neanderthal dna on their genomes a we hypothesize that roughly 50 000 years ago when the ancestors of modern humans migrated out of africa and into eurasia they encountered neanderthals matings must have occurred then and later one reason we deduce this is because the descendants of those who remained in africa present day africans don t have neanderthal dna what does that mean for people who have it at my lab we ve been doing genetic testing on the blood samples of 28 000 patients at vanderbilt and eight other medical centers across the country computers help us pinpoint where on the human genome this neanderthal dna is and we run that against information from the patients anonymized medical records we re looking for associations what we ve been finding is that neanderthal dna has a subtle influence on risk for disease it affects our immune system and how we respond to different immune challenges it affects our skin you re slightly more prone to a condition where you can get scaly lesions after extreme sun exposure there s an increased risk for blood clots and tobacco addiction to our surprise it appears that some neanderthal dna can increase the risk for depression however there are other neanderthal bits that decrease the risk roughly 1 to 2 percent of one s risk for depression is determined by neanderthal dna it all depends on where on the genome it s located was there ever an upside to having neanderthal dna it probably helped our ancestors survive in prehistoric europe when humans migrated into eurasia they encountered unfamiliar hazards and pathogens by mating with neanderthals they gave their offspring needed defenses and immunities that trait for blood clotting helped wounds close up quickly in the modern world however this trait means greater risk for stroke and pregnancy complications what helped us then doesn t necessarily now did you say earlier that neanderthal dna increases susceptibility to nicotine addiction yes neanderthal dna can mean you re more likely to get hooked on nicotine even though there were no tobacco plants in archaic europe we think this might be because there s a bit of neanderthal dna right next to a human gene that s a neurotransmitter implicated in a generalized risk for addiction in this case and probably others we think the neanderthal bits on the genome may serve as switches that turn human genes on or off aside from the neanderthals do we know if our ancestors mated with other hominids we think they did sometimes when we re examining genomes we can see the genetic afterimages of hominids who haven t even been identified yet a few years ago the swedish geneticist svante paabo received an unusual fossilized bone fragment from siberia he extracted the dna sequenced it and realized it was neither human nor neanderthal what paabo found was a previously unknown hominid he named denisovan after the cave where it had been discovered it turned out that denisovan dna can be found on the genomes of modern southeast asians and new guineans have you long been interested in genetics growing up i was very interested in history but i also loved computers i ended up majoring in computer science at college and going to graduate school in it however during my first year in graduate school i realized i wasn t very motivated by the problems that computer scientists worked on fortunately around that time the early 2000s it was becoming clear that people with computational skills could have a big impact in biology and genetics the human genome had just been mapped what an accomplishment we now had the code to what makes you you and me me i wanted to be part of that kind of work so i switched over to biology and it was there that i heard about a new field where you used computation and genetics research to look back in time evolutionary genomics there may be no written records from prehistory but genomes are a living record if we can find ways to read them we can discover things we couldn t know any other way not long ago the two top editors of the new england journal of medicine published an editorial questioning data sharing a common practice where scientists recycle raw data other researchers have collected for their own studies they labeled some of the recycling researchers data parasites how did you feel when you read that i was upset the data sets we used were not originally collected to specifically study neanderthal dna in modern humans thousands of patients at vanderbilt consented to have their blood and their medical records deposited in a biobank to find genetic diseases three years ago when i set up my lab at vanderbilt i saw the potential of the biobank for studying both genetic diseases and human evolution i wrote special computer programs so that we could mine existing data for these purposes that s not being a parasite that s moving knowledge forward i suspect that most of the patients who contributed their information are pleased to see it used in a wider way what has been the response to your neanderthal research since you published it last year in the journal science some of it s very touching people are interested in learning about where they came from some of it is a little silly i have a lot of hair on my legs is that from neanderthals but i received racist inquiries too i got calls from all over the world from people who thought that since africans didn t interbreed with neanderthals this somehow justified their ideas of white superiority it was illogical actually neanderthal dna is mostly bad for us though that didn t bother them as you do your studies do you ever wonder about what the lives of the neanderthals were like it s hard not to genetics has taught us a tremendous amount about that and there s a lot of evidence that they were much more human than apelike they ve gotten a bad rap we tend to think of them as dumb and brutish there s no reason to believe that maybe those of us of european heritage should be thinking let s improve their standing in the popular imagination they re our ancestors too ',\n",

ask that you support me support my sister support my mother support my best friend and all of our girlfriends otherwise ms johansson said her own daughter may potentially not have the right to make choices for her body and her future that your daughter ivanka has been privileged to have many participants believed that mr trump expressed misogynistic views during the presidential campaign with remarks about megyn kelly carly fiorina and hillary clinton after the 2005 recording surfaced several women came forward to accuse mr trump of inappropriate sexual conduct he dismissed the recording as locker room banter and assailed his accusers in a sly allusion to the crude remarks mr trump made in the recording many marchers men and women alike wore pink pussyhats complete with cat ears the

put us together it s like a puzzle all these people came together piece by piece and now donald trump is coming over and just breaking those puzzle pieces ',\n",

drawn attention to crucial issues occasionally resulted in violence and often prompted opposing gatherings marian b mollin an associate professor at virginia tech who studies the history of social movements said successful marches had capitalized on symbolism and street theater attracted a broad coalition and pushed clear policy goals but the test of a march s efficacy she said is whether it

       " 'washington hours after president trump took his oath on friday the justice department issued an opinion saying that his appointment of his jared kushner as a senior white house adviser would be lawful despite a federal antinepotism law in a opinion signed on friday a longtime career lawyer in the justice department s office of legal counsel said that the president s special hiring authority exempted white house positions from a 1967 law barring the president from employing relatives at a federal agency some legal experts had raised concerns that mr kushner s appointment violated that law which congress enacted several years after president john f kennedy had appointed his brother robert as attorney general but the new justice department opinion signed by daniel l koffsky a deputy assistant attorney general in the legal counsel office said mr trump had the power to appoint mr kushner anyway because of a subsequent 1978 law that gives the president the authority to appoint white house staff members without regard to other laws restricting employment and compensation of federal employees mr koffsky s opinion acknowledged that in several cases since 1978 the office of legal counsel had determined that the antinepotism statute prevented presidents from appointing relatives to positions although our conclusion today departs from some of that prior work we think that this departure is fully justified he wrote the revised position came after an effort by jamie s gorelick mr kushner s lawyer and a deputy attorney general during the clinton administration who is now a lawyer at the firm wilmerhale to clear away obstacles to mr kushner s appointment the opinion paves the way for mr kushner 35 to join mr trump in the west wing among the new president s closest advisers during the campaign mr kushner married mr trump s daughter ivanka in 2009 he has run his family s vast real estate company and has owned a newspaper the new york observer mr trump announced on jan 9 that he would appoint mr kushner who will not accept a salary his purview is expected to include the middle east and israel government partnerships with the private sector and matters involving free trade if you can t produce peace in the middle east nobody can mr trump said to mr kushner at an event on thursday the appointment of mr kushner will be a dramatic change in 1977 for example the justice department barred president jimmy carter from appointing his son to an unpaid white house role citing the antinepotism law even after congress enacted the 1978 law the justice department continued to block proposed appointments of presidential relatives mr koffsky s opinion which he worked on in the final days of the obama administration acknowledged a 1983 case in which the office barred president ronald reagan from appointing a relative to an advisory committee and a 2009 case in which it blocked president barack obama from appointing his and a half sister to advisory committees but mr koffsky maintained those opinions failed to adequately address the impact of the special hiring authority that congress gave the president for his personal staff as part of the 1978 law he also wrote that it was unlikely that congress could bar a president from obtaining informal ad hoc policy advice from a relative and a major consequence of allowing mr kushner s appointment to a formal role is that he will be subject to the usual ethics rules for white house employees like laws mr kushner intends to sell some assets to his brother and to put others into a trust overseen by his mother said ms gorelick who has worked on the plan ms gorelick said she had been consulting with federal ethics officials to try to address any issues associated with mr kushner s appointment he will also be required to file a financial disclosure report that details his assets and income and to divest some holdings that could create a conflict of interest when mr trump announced mr kushner s appointment ms gorelick told reporters that while there were arguments on both sides of the legal question she believed the better argument was that it would be lawful she also disclosed then that the trump transition team would seek an office of legal counsel opinion in an email on saturday ms gorelick said that we believed that we had the better argument on this adding that the office of legal counsel of the justice department in an opinion by a highly regarded career deputy assistant attorney general adopted a position consistent with our own richard w painter who served as a white house lawyer in the george w bush administration said that while he had some doubts about the new opinion it is a reasonable interpretation of the law but what is important now he added is that mr kushner complies with the and disclosure provisions and i wish his the president would do the same ',\n",
       " 'washington one topic has dominated conversations among elected republicans since president trump s stunning victory will he actually pursue his campaign agenda of nationalism all but obliterating the distinctions that have defined america s political parties for a century while some of his advisers suggested that he would slip back into a more conventional republican approach mr trump dropped hints in interviews twitter posts and other public comments that he intended to push his party away from its internationalist dogma on trade foreign alliances immigration infrastructure spending and prescription drug access the hints are over an inaugural speech delivered with the same blunt force that propelled mr trump s insurgent campaign has dashed republican hopes for a more traditional agenda with his new decree he declared himself modern america s first populist president and all but dared his own party to resist his republican reformation every decision on trade on taxes on immigration on foreign affairs will be made to benefit american workers and american families he said mr trump s vision will inevitably collide with establishment republican leaders in congress and the outcome could determine not just the success of mr trump s presidency but also the identity of his party republicans have resisted democratic efforts to spend big on the nation s roads bridges tunnels and rail lines use the federal government s power to bargain for lower prescription drug prices block trade agreements and limit foreign interventions republican leaders have sought a approach on immigration laws offering a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants and tried to restrain popular programs like social security and medicare if the president is able to blur party lines on such issues and harness an ascendant coalition to win that clash he will have untethered conservatism from the republican party and shifted the party away from the approach that has been its hallmark since ronald reagan stood 36 years ago in the same position on the capitol steps as mr trump but mr trump is about to discover that his hopes for a realignment may not come easily as in his campaign he faces an array of obstacles his historic unpopularity and lack of discipline advisers who hope to nudge him back toward conventional republicanism and perhaps most significant other party leaders who have a more conservative outlook on domestic policy and government spending and a more hawkish attitude on foreign affairs the alarm and anxiety within the republican party s congressional wing toward its own president are remarkable and among mr trump s most outspoken intraparty critics the warnings of resistance are unambiguous there are three branches of government said senator john mccain republican of arizona we now have a majority in both houses and both majorities i think hold to basic conservative republican principles the threat of reprisal mr mccain said he intended to be true to what he saw as his party and his voters trump carried arizona by four points i carried my state by 14 points senator jeff flake of arizona who like mr mccain has repeatedly clashed with mr trump said that he was preparing for the president to back his opponent in a primary next year but that it would not dissuade him from putting up opposition on some issues there are some of us who will be pushing to get back to the roots of the party limited government economic freedom individual responsibility free trade mr flake said those are things that the party has stood on for a long time mr trump and some of his closest advisers say such resistance is not just futile but foolish and they are already pledging to harness mr trump s following in the states and districts of recalcitrant republicans to sound warnings of their own the incentive for many of these members will be to follow mr trump s lead because he won many of their states said kellyanne conway the president s campaign chief turned senior white house adviser aiming at perhaps the most powerful congressional republican and one of the more orthodox conservatives ms conway pointedly recalled speaker paul d ryan s inability to carry his own state in 2012 as the party s nominee speaker ryan knows lost by seven points in wisconsin and mr trump just won the state she said as ms conway noted many republican skeptics were doubtful that mr trump could win in the first place but even some on the right who are sympathetic to elements of his vision worry that there is no infrastructure to undergird and promote trumpism unlike reagan s conservative movement or former president bill clinton s centrist third way approach traditional conservatives dominate capitol hill washington s think tanks and advocacy groups as well as statehouses populism has been an energy that has carried republicans into office but once in office very few of them stay populist said matthew continetti editor in chief of the conservative washington free beacon reihan salam the executive editor of national review said i think it s likely that trump is premature arguing that mr trump is aligned with the party s voters but a step ahead of its congressional wing he is only one man there are republicans who still believe that mr trump will govern more as a conservative even as he attracts a broader coalition of voters to the party i don t think he is going to fundamentally reshape the party on issues predicted gov scott walker of wisconsin he added that mr trump s political legacy would be to open the eyes of voters who had not supported republican presidential hopefuls in recent years mr walker said mr trump himself had said he was not a policy guy and argued that the president would lean heavily on vice president mike pence and the white house chief of staff reince priebus to carry out his agenda that is exactly what worries some republicans who share mr trump s views that the president will be undermined by some in his inner circle when mr trump veered away from orthodoxy during the transition some of his advisers quickly tried to recast his comments with a more conservative veneer my concern with reince is he s bringing in a lot of the folks said rick santorum a onetime senator from pennsylvania who ran a campaign for the republican presidential nomination in 2012 they re not fans of the agenda much less real fans of trump and mr santorum added of mr pence s roots in traditional conservatism candidly this is not where mike has been in the past either still mr santorum said he spoke on the phone to mr trump this past week and the incoming president was every bit as committed to his style of politics as he was during the campaign he s not going to change mr santorum said mr trump s inaugural address reflected as much and it highlighted the influence of the most prominent nationalists entering the west wing this weekend the senior advisers stephen k bannon and stephen miller the new president not only outlined his brand of politics but also sent a message to those who work in the building behind him we will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action mr trump said the time for empty talk is over or as ms conway put it when he says we re going to build the wall he means it and when he says we re going to renegotiate trade deals he means it or undercutting or trying to change donald trump is a fool s errand she added people who watched this campaign should have discovered that by now ',\n",
       " 'washington president trump plans to take executive action on a nearly daily basis for a month to unravel his predecessor s legacy and begin enacting his own agenda his aides say part of an extended exercise of presidential power to quickly make good on his campaign promises but in a reflection of the improvisational style that helped fuel his rise he has made few if any firm decisions about which orders he wants to make or in which order that is a striking break from past presidents who have entered office with detailed plans for rolling out a series of executive actions that set a tone for their presidencies and send a clear message about their agendas it was plain that mr trump had devised no such strategy by his first day in office as advisers expressed doubt until the last moments about whether he would issue any directives on friday it s going to be a decision sean spicer the white house press secretary told reporters that afternoon then around 7 p m reporters were suddenly summoned to the oval office after sprinting from the briefing room they watched mr trump sign a directive to federal agencies to begin scaling back parts of the affordable care act there are a number that are being looked at but it s just a question of which ones he feels like doing and when mr spicer had said of executive orders earlier on friday in recent days he had said that mr trump s top aides were still deciding on the sequencing of the unilateral actions still there is little doubt about the policy areas in mr trump s sights international trade deals illegal immigration the fight against the islamic state climate change and washington lobbying in his first in office mr trump focused on health care ordering the machinery of government to look for every opportunity to pull back on president barack obama s signature achievement by waiving fees or granting exemptions to states businesses individuals and insurance companies he also moved quickly to freeze the obama administration s unfinished regulations a routine step for an incoming president of the opposite party during the campaign mr trump railed against mr obama s use of executive authority to sidestep an uncooperative congress on issues like immigration and health care after his victory mr trump vowed to use those same powers to quickly reverse the country s ideological course aides said they hoped to group mr trump s executive actions thematically for maximum impact they gave few other details though some advisers suggested that executive actions on illegal immigration could be among the first issued after the inaugural weekend advocates for undocumented workers are anxiously waiting to see what mr trump will do if he moves aggressively he could immediately overturn deferred action for childhood arrivals or daca the program mr obama created to protect young immigrants who were brought illegally to the united states as children giving them legal status and access to work permits ending that program would put as many as 800 000 of them at risk of being removed from their families and sent to the countries they had left as children the white house could instead unwind the program slowly giving the young people often called dreamers more time before their immigration protections and work permits expire senator richard j durbin democrat of illinois said on friday that in a brief conversation with the new president mr trump had given him assurances about the program the president mr durbin said told him that we don t want to hurt those kids we re going to do something thank goodness he said that the senator added the president could also order federal agents to conduct workplace raids to crack down on immigration violations he could take action against sanctuary cities those that shield undocumented immigrants from deportation or he could issue an order reinstating a program known as secure communities in which the local authorities cooperated with federal agencies to detect and deport illegal immigrants and he could order work to begin at least symbolically on a wall at the southern border financing construction of the entire wall would require congressional action however but on the border wall and other promises mr trump now faces the challenge of translating slogans into action he has already missed the deadline for a vow he made in august to start deporting illegal immigrants with criminal records on his first day in office we will begin moving them out day 1 he said during a rally in phoenix my first hour in office those people are gone mr trump s approach to using his newly minted executive power mirrors his often chaotic transition to the white house the nature of the new president s first 24 hours reflected his management style both in his business empire and in the campaign which went through four as aides fell into and out of favor his travel schedule was rarely planned out more than a few days in advance and mr trump did not hesitate to tear it apart when he wanted to decisions would be telegraphed by top advisers only to be pulled back within hours or never formally announced the lack of planning stands in stark contrast to the approaches of past presidents who have sought to demonstrate the change in direction they hope to lead and maximize the effectiveness of their unilateral actions ronald reagan retreated to the president s room just off the senate floor only moments after being sworn in and signed an order freezing federal hiring echoing the declaration in his inaugural address that government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem mr obama also decided well in advance which executive actions he wanted to take in his first days after a team of lawyers led by gregory b craig his first white house counsel spent much of his transition planning what he could do without congress to illustrate a stark break with george w bush s presidency on his second full day in office mr obama ordered the closing of the guantánamo bay prison a directive still unfulfilled and banned torture by mandating that terrorism interrogations be guided by the army field manual mr obama s embrace of executive orders early in the administration and later when a congress blocked his legislative agenda may have helped pave the way for mr trump to take quick action since many of mr obama s achievements were put in place with executive action mr trump can reverse them at least over time the same way ',\n",

embracing the melting pot check when melania trump took the stage with her husband president trump on friday night for the inaugural balls she demonstrated that while she may have been out of the spotlight since the election she hasn t been sticking her head in the sand she has been closely studying the vernacular of first lady dress in an architectural white crepe column with a thin burgundy ribbon as a belt a high slit and a gazar wave curving from sleeve to hip and then down the skirt she looked especially when compared with the younger generation of trump women most of whom opted for sparkling princess gowns understated and adult not remotely mired in the 1980s though her husband s look and rhetoric may be and despite rampant speculation about the designer behind the dress she cannily managed to surprise the entire fashion world the gown was according to a statement from her office a collaboration between mrs trump and the designer hervé pierre a frenchman who moved to new york in the early 1990s and eventually became creative director of carolina herrera where he and mrs trump met and where he worked on clothes for laura bush and michelle obama though largely behind the scenes he left that post last february this is his first major dress under his own name he does not yet have a collection in that context it will eventually join the exhibit of first ladies gowns at the smithsonian stretching back to helen taft in 1909 though rumors had surfaced earlier in the week that mrs trump was working with chanel s creative director karl lagerfeld on her gown in the end

american after over 20 years in this country mr pierre counts indeed with one notable exception kellyanne conway s coat at the which looked like she might have borrowed it off a toy soldier it was her trump revolution wear she told reporters but in fact turned out to be a 3 600 design from the italian brand gucci the inaugural weekend overall was a series of america first fashion moments literally and metaphorically and not just when it came to the women there has been a lot of speculation over whether the office of president will change mr trump encourage moderation of his twitter account for example or his language as yet that is unclear but it does appear to have changed how his family dresses on friday the president wore an overcoat and shirt to the said to be by brooks brothers the american men s wear brand that outfitted 39 presidents before him lincoln grant chester arthur theodore roosevelt woodrow wilson and barack obama wore brooks brothers for their ceremonies and mr obama even wore his overcoat again on friday when he stood with mr trump for a man who often overtly rejected the washington establishment and what came before in his speech it was nevertheless a nod to tradition and history the day before melania trump who during the campaign tended toward european brands stepped off the military jet that brought the trumps to washington for a ceremony at arlington national cemetery in a strict coat by norisol ferrari a small independent new york designer who described herself to wwd as a minority woman then that evening at the donors black tie dinner the first lady wore a nude sequined gown by reem acra the designer based in new york and ivanka trump wore three different outfits from oscar de la renta a name of new york fashion week a coat and matching dress to arlington a gown to the donor s dinner and a white pantsuit to the oscar de la renta himself dressed both hillary clinton and laura bush for their husbands second inaugural balls the brand is something of an inaugural for the balls she donned carolina herrera it was when mrs trump wore a ralph lauren cashmere dress and coat to the inauguration day festivities however that it became indubitable that something strategic was going on it is not just because mr lauren is a designer who has built an empire on the mythology of the american dream or because he has outfitted the u s olympic team and donated 13 million to help restore the banner at the national museum of american history and it is not because he had dressed four first ladies before crossing political parties in service to the role it is because the dress and coat he made for mrs trump in shape and shade created an image that was redolent of nothing so much as jacqueline kennedy at her camelot inaugural with all the new beginnings and freighted history that implies whatever you think of the reality of that connection and on social media there was a lot of verbal the outfit oozed appropriateness if it looked like something of a first lady costume and it did it also suggested that mrs trump had studied up and was prepared to assume the starring role she played later in the evening just as ivanka trump s trouser suit which was designed by fernando garcia one half of the new young creative duo at oscar de la renta seemed a sign of the unofficial role she has often suggested she will pursue women s advocate white pantsuits after all became famous over the summer when hillary clinton wore one also by ralph lauren to accept the democratic nomination for president at least in part in acknowledgment of the suffragists who chose white as one of their signature colors later the white outfits were adopted as a uniform of sorts by women as they went to the polls it was thus a fairly pointed and to some poignant moment when mrs clinton appeared in a final white ralph lauren pantsuit to accompany her husband to the inauguration a suit that had been made as part of her campaign

       " 'washington the glorious lincoln memorial was closed on inauguration day leaving its white marble inhabitant to inspire from a distance the monument had served as a backdrop for an inaugural concert the night before and now in the late morning construction workers were methodically removing the silvery bars of scaffolding that imprisoned it even so its sole resident could still be seen behind the doric columns his gaze trained on the domed capitol where a peaceful transfer of power was about to take place and people still came to be in his presence some to remind themselves that a

       " 'turkey s parliament approved a proposed constitution on saturday that would cede even greater powers to the country s president if endorsed in a national referendum but the bitterly contested voting process was marred by screaming matches and physical altercations that sent at least three legislators to a hospital the low point came when supporters of the governing justice and development party in an apparent attack on the floor of parliament on thursday knocked off the artificial arm of the opposition politician safak pavey a former united nations diplomat ms pavey suffered injuries to the socket of her arm when the prosthesis was dislocated she had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident years ago lawmakers have been debating the proposed constitution since jan 9 and over the past week they have engaged in a protracted round of voting on each of the 18 articles in the document often debating until the early hours finishing at 3 15 a m friday for instance the final vote on the constitution took place early saturday the associated press reported the final draft will be put to a national referendum the president recep tayyip erdogan forged an alliance between followers of his party and the nationalist movement party or m h p in an effort to gain enough votes to pass the new constitution he succeeded despite bitter criticism by opposition parties and the peoples democratic party or h d p many of h d p s legislators including its have been jailed by mr erdogan s government on terrorism charges the proposed constitution comes during a period of emergency rule also approved by parliament in the wake of the failed coup attempt in july against mr erdogan since then he has ordered the dismissal of 100 000 state employees and the jailing of more than 40 000 others suspected of supporting the coup he has also cracked down on the independent news media jailing about 140 journalists in the past year with at least 81 still in prison last month according to the committee to protect journalists more than in any other country critics say the new constitution will give mr erdogan even greater powers than he already has enabling him to invoke much more sweeping emergency rule measures mr erdogan and his supporters say the changes would streamline and end a system that divides power between a prime minister and a president the current prime minister binali yildirim is an erdogan supporter who favors the proposed changes our relationship with the president is good mr yildirim said this week in a television interview but tomorrow if there are two names with strong egos this situation could cause problems the country would be unmanageable mr erdogan was prime minister from 2003 to 2014 the year he became president taking over a post that had been largely ceremonial however his control over his party known by the initials of its turkish name a k p enabled him to curtail the prime minister s power and he forced the resignation of mr yildirim s predecessor ahmet davutoglu the new constitution would also allow a president to be the official head of his party something not now permitted but it would limit the president to two terms this has nothing to do with dictatorship authoritarianism the president s spokesman ibrahim kalin said in a speech last week he said the changes would maintain separation of powers and democratic checks on the president those two fundamental elements are protected opponents say the new constitution would allow the president to appoint supreme court judges and take control of the budget away from parliament it nullifies the unchangeable principles of the constitution the principles of being a secular democratic republic with rule of law said an opposition lawmaker ali seker this package is designing a regime according to the mood of one person this is called dictatorship critics in parliament say the jailing of at least 11 h d p legislators and the governing party s insistence on marathon sessions has rushed through the new constitution without time for the country to consider its provisions thoroughly even with the missing h d p members mr erdogan s party did not have a majority to carry the vote turning instead to the m h p rightists the rightist party had previously campaigned for restoration of the death penalty which has been dropped as part of turkey s accession talks with the european union the rightists would like to use capital punishment against abdullah ocalan the imprisoned leader of the kurdistan workers party or p k k in the current debate though it has not raised that demand and there has been speculation that it will get a cabinet post as a reward for its support passions have been high throughout the sessions in parliament with fistfights a regular feature the government s own parliamentary television channel did not broadcast the sessions live despite the importance of the debates but many of the members posted video feeds of the melees on social media in the session on thursday the violence broke out largely among female lawmakers it began when an opposition member aylin nazliaka handcuffed herself to the microphone on the lectern as a protest lawmakers from the governing party then swarmed around her to remove the handcuffs and in the ensuing struggle a crowd of women could be seen on video punching kicking and pulling one another s hair during the altercation ms pavey s prosthetic arm was dislodged she fell and was later hospitalized ms nazliaka was separated from the microphone and she said her hand had been injured they attacked all of us blinded by anger ms pavey said afterward this assault shows a sample of what they will do to us after the constitutional amendment package passes the debate on the constitution comes at a time of high tension in turkey amid the crackdowns on kurdish politicians and on followers of the exiled muslim cleric fethullah gulen whom the government accuses of staging the attempted coup there has been a series of terrorist attacks including one on a nightclub on new year s day killing 39 people the governor of istanbul vasip sahin said on twitter that an assailant using a flame thrower on friday attacked istanbul s police headquarters where the authorities were holding abdulgadir masharipov who was charged in the new year s nightclub attack and whom officials described as an islamic state militant the assailant also attacked the nearby a k p headquarters the governor said no one was hurt in addition turkey is coping with millions of mostly syrian refugees under an agreement with the european union to prevent them from continuing to flood into europe in exchange for billions of euros in european union aid the crackdown on political opponents and the news media has led to criticism from the european union and has greatly set back turkey s hopes to join the bloc mr erdogan has reacted to that criticism bitterly threatening to break with the bloc

       " 'in my spare time when not writing about consumer technology for the new york times i have a sideline renting out a cabin on airbnb so when jose reserved the property last october it was nothing unusual he said he wanted to host some relatives for a quiet weekend in the mountains i welcomed him without hesitation that saturday my neighbors texted me as they watched caterers carry large white pillars and bouquets into the backyard then 10 cars surrounded the front yard and dozens of people wearing suits and dresses poured into the house it became clear this was no intimate for a day my airbnb rental was turned into a wedding venue which broke city laws my business would be in jeopardy if the police were notified such is life as an airbnb superhost since buying my cabin in northern california in late 2015 i have hosted about 30 groups and become part of the booming ecosystem for airbnb the online reservation marketplace that lets people turn their homes into vacation rentals with more than 140 million guest arrivals to date airbnb has proved a boon for hosts and an attractive option for travelers looking to avoid hefty fees from hotels in the process i have been named a superhost which means i have hosted many guests and consistently received reviews it s a small group researchers say only about 7 percent of hosts are superhosts in exchange i get more visibility in search results invitations from the company to exclusive events and a medal next to my profile photo the designation as a superhost has paid off my house is a few bookings away from netting a profit yet vaulting to superhost status is hardly intuitive and i learned hard lessons along the way here are some tips on running a successful and lucrative airbnb rental based on interviews with superhosts and my experience people who rent your house on airbnb are choosing it over a hotel so you had better be as hospitable friendly and communicative as a hotel for your rental that means a few things provide staples like cooking equipment cable tv soap for bathing and cleaning towels toothpaste and toilet paper your house should work as advertised faulty appliances should be repaired or replaced for another be extremely responsive to guests much like a hotel front desk nobody trusts a host who is slow to respond jasper ribbers a of get paid for your pad a book about his experience as an airbnb superhost who has completed more than 300 stays uses the app avivaiq to respond automatically to messages from potential guests which comes in handy when he is asleep when he is awake he can continue the conversation being dishonest about your listing will hurt when it comes time for a guest to leave a review it s better to be straightforward about what you are offering and transparent about any imperfections in my experience guests were surprised in the summer that the house lacked even though the listing never said it had i resolved this with subsequent guests by saying explicitly in my welcome email that the house lacked and that portable fans were in each room be quick to address complaints or risk facing a negative review if a dishwasher breaks or the shower pressure is too low send a plumber if a remote control was misplaced or stolen by a previous group have a backup remote ready in a drawer if you host the property remotely the best option is to befriend someone trustworthy in the neighborhood who can act as a property manager pay the manager a fee for each task airbnb attracts travelers from all over the world and it is remarkable how standards for cleanliness differ from person to person my jaw dropped when one guest left a positive review about her stay but dropped me one star because the brush was dirty couldn t she have used the clean sponge instead there is no point acting defensive the solution is to hire superb professional cleaners relay any negative feedback from guests to your cleaners so they improve over time depending on where your house is demand may be higher at certain times of year if you hope to ever make a profit you will want to set prices higher during peak rental seasons and reduce prices during slow seasons but constantly changing prices on your listing can be daunting i use a dynamic pricing tool beyondpricing com that automatically adjusts prices based on demand including factors like holidays peak travel season and the day of the week airbnb provides its own dynamic pricing tool called smart pricing but in my experience it chooses rates that are too low last year airbnb introduced an policy that urged hosts to welcome guests regardless of race religion sexual orientation gender and age that makes sense since airbnb wants to connect hosts with travelers from all over the world but it doesn t mean you should let just anybody into your home hosts reserve the right to decide what types of groups they would like to host especially when taking into consideration city laws for my rental city law forbids loud parties past 10 p m when guests request the house i ask them the purpose of the visit and ask them to carefully read and agree to my house rules including one about loud noise i am less inclined to book a group of college students looking to have a party than i am to book a family planning a winter vacation though if the students promised to stay quiet i would probably book them mr ribbers the airbnb superhost said he preferred families or couples staying in his apartment in amsterdam partly because of the size constraints he also typically accepts bookings only from guests who already have positive reviews themselves when guests reserve his home he reads their profiles to get a sense of their personalities and check if they have verified their identities with airbnb by providing driver s license information among other documentation some vetting is permitted by airbnb s nondiscrimination policy which says hosts can decline to rent based on factors that are not prohibited by law so my rejection of those planning to have loud parties fits the bill another important point is to describe your listing depending on the guests you want mr ribbers titled his listing couples getaway my listing intended to attract family ski trips advertises the house s proximity to the ski lifts most guests are not bad people but perhaps one out of 10 times a rotten egg will pass your smell test the lesson i learned from jose was that being a superhost did not make me impervious to the actions of a misbehaving guest to protect yourself diligently document everything valuable in your house take photos of countertops the refrigerator stove dining table barbecue grill and television set in the event anything is damaged airbnb will ask for photos to prove that guests caused the damage with jose after an airbnb representative evicted the group for breaking my house rules i found a large chip in my kitchen countertop after sending airbnb the photo of the damaged countertop a company representative concluded it was not reasonable to let me keep jose s security deposit because there is no way to document whether or not the chip on the counter was there before or after this guest stayed at the listing airbnb did agree to charge jose for excess guests but only for those my neighbors were able to photograph nick shapiro an airbnb spokesman said i should have been treated better and the company apologized that its resolution process did not work as it was supposed to in this incident in my conversations with jose he insisted that he did nothing wrong and that i broke the contract by kicking his group out of the house neither of us could leave each other a review because his reservation was voided ',\n",

       " 'detroit a low buzz fills the air as an army of mortgage bankers perched below floating canopies in a kaleidoscope of vivid pinks blues purples and greens works the phones promising borrowers easy financing and low rates for home loans by the elevators nobody blinks when an employee wearing a pink tutu bustles past on any given day a company mascot simon a bespectacled mouse goes on the hunt for gouda or good ideas from the work force a visit to the headquarters of quicken loans in downtown detroit may seem like a trip to a place where glengarry glen ross meets seussville but the whimsical irreverent atmosphere sits atop a business in a field the selling of the american dream that has changed drastically since an earlier generation of mortgage lenders propelled the economy to near collapse in 2008 by issuing risky and even fraudulent loans in the years since the crisis many of the nation s largest banks pulled back their activities quicken loans pushed in today it is the retail mortgage lender originating 96 billion in mortgages last year an eightfold increase from 2008 privately held quicken like some of america s largest banks before it has also landed in regulators cross hairs in a federal lawsuit filed in 2015 the department of justice charged that among other things the company misrepresented borrowers income or credit scores or inflated appraisals in order to qualify for federal housing administration insurance as a result when those loans soured the government says that taxpayers not quicken loans suffered millions of dollars in losses quicken loans today is the f h a insurance program s largest participant executives at quicken loans deny the charges maintaining among other things that the government a small number of examples to build its case in an aggressive move the company sued the department of justice demanding a blanket ruling that all of the loans it had originated met requirements and pose no undue risks to the f h a insurance fund quicken s suit was dismissed but it reflects the style of quicken loans founder and chairman dan gilbert the billionaire who once publicly excoriated the n b a superstar lebron james for leaving the cleveland cavaliers in which mr gilbert has a majority stake he also owns significant chunks of central detroit where quicken loans is based mr gilbert who founded the company in 1985 sold it to the business software company intuit in 1999 before buying it back with other investors in 2002 he is working to rectify the city s downtrodden image with streetcars upscale cafes and boutiques and data making him a hometown hero late last year quicken loans won a motion to move the department of justice case to a federal courthouse roughly three blocks from its detroit headquarters sitting on the edge of a chair in his office the motor city s skyline a steel gray in the november sun mr gilbert said that his company has been unfairly targeted you want to know what this case is about he said somebody probably put up a whiteboard and said here are the 10 largest f h a lenders now go and collect settlements from them regardless of whether they did anything wrong in court documents quicken argues it has the lowest default rates in the f h a program it projects the government will reap 5 7 billion in net profits from the insurance premiums for loans made from 2007 to 2013 after paying out any claims a spokesman for the department of housing and urban development which is home to the f h a program at the center of the case against quicken declined to speak about the lawsuit late last year donald j trump named a former quicken loans lobbyist shawn krause to his h u d transition team a trump spokeswoman did not respond to an email asking about potential conflicts of interest in an emailed statement quicken loans said the fact that ms krause had come from the largest f h a lender in the country bodes well for the positive impact she has and will make on h u d in the years since the financial crisis quicken has emerged as a leader in the nation s system a network of nonbank financial institutions that has gained significant ground against its more heavily regulated bank counterparts in providing home loans to americans increased regulation and decreased profits sent the nation s banks packing nonbanks like quicken have filled that gap today quicken is the nation s retail residential mortgage lender behind wells fargo but ahead of banking giants like j p morgan bank of america and citigroup according to mortgage daily considered by many to be a visionary leader mr gilbert often strikes a pugnacious stance when mr james the n b a star announced he was leaving the cleveland cavaliers in 2010 to join the miami heat mr gilbert who not only has a majority stake in the cavaliers but also operates quicken loans arena where they play penned a public tirade against the cowardly betrayal in a letter written in the typeface comic sans mr james is again playing for the cavaliers a call to his agent seeking comment was not returned the year before mr gilbert got into an altercation at a bar mitzvah punching a former colleague david hall in the head before he was escorted out by security according to interviews conducted by the birmingham police department in michigan in police documents mr gilbert s lawyer said mr hall filed the complaint in order to pressure mr gilbert into paying 2 million to buy out mr hall s investments in mr gilbert s companies the birmingham city attorney ultimately denied a warrant in the case on the grounds that the charges were not supported by probable cause mr hall did not return an email seeking comment in an email statement a quicken loans spokesman said mr gilbert defended himself in a minor confrontation that was instigated by a former employee who was the aggressor on a more trifling scale after sending text messages about this article to a reporter at the new york times but not receiving a response mr gilbert was texting her landline number by accident he followed up with an email accusing the reporter of disconnecting her mobile phone to avoid him the phone likely is one of your temporary numbers that you deploy for the surreptitious work that you do he wrote when alerted to the misunderstanding mr gilbert apologized for any of it that was caused on my end when mr gilbert was asked in an email if he often strikes a combative stance or frequently attacks his critics a quicken loans spokesman responded in an email it s interesting that when someone with as long and successful career as mr gilbert is forced to defend his integrity and honor from old insignificant already rehashed incidents and accusations from a media source as credible as the ny times you would imply that doing such is frequently attacking his critics these days mr gilbert appears to be itching for a fight with the justice department in court filings quicken argued that the government investigation was based on 55 loans out of nearly 250 000 quicken also argued that a longstanding f h a process to resolve loans that did not meet its requirements through either the repurchase of the loan or by indemnifying f h a from any losses was retroactively discontinued for quicken since 2011 mr gilbert has spent more than 2 2 billion on downtown detroit buying up 95 decrepit properties and rehabilitating them in an effort to lure new tenants nike opened a store there last year the new york burger chain shake shack is coming in 2017 as is the sports retailer under armour mr gilbert also notes that he has leased space downtown to several local businesses that sort of presence makes downtown detroit today seem a bit like a company town a sort of quickenville that s because quicken loans is just one of more than 100 closely knit companies that is owned or controlled by mr gilbert with a footprint in the area through his commercial real estate properties mr gilbert can decide which tenants fit into his vision for downtown detroit and which don t rocket fiber an idea developed by three former quicken loans technology employees and financially backed by mr gilbert has brought internet to downtown detroit for a 15 million donation quicken received the naming rights for the qline a streetcar that is expected to start running through downtown detroit this spring mr gilbert sits on the board of the streetcar project lines of bicycles in downtown detroit are available free for all employees of mr gilbert s companies and visitors can bet at the tables at jack detroit greektown a gambling venture controlled by mr gilbert the quicken loans family also includes one of the largest title companies in the united states an appraisal firm a call center and realty which says on its website that it is the preferred real estate partner of quicken loans mr gilbert who was busted in college for running a football betting ring the charges were dismissed and his record was expunged plays on a big stage back in 2010 he guaranteed that the cavaliers would win the n b a championship before lebron james would they didn t but the team led by mr james did win the title last year and this season s team has the highest payroll in the league with quicken loans mr gilbert has built a company in the industry former executives describe quicken loans as a technology company that sells mortgages but the heart that keeps quicken s blood moving is the 3 500 mortgage bankers who work its phones many new employees come in with little to no background in financial services one employee joined after delivering pizzas to the quicken loans office and becoming interested in working there employees typically make hundreds of calls a day trying to get potential customers on the phone not unlike the assembly lines that put together cars in detroit the call is immediately handed off to a licensed mortgage banker who completes the loan application then quickly passes it to processing so that he or she can focus on the next loan application mr gilbert said clients are able to close more quickly on loans when specialists focus on each stage of the loan process he and other quicken executives note that the company has repeatedly made fortune magazine s list of best places to work for and has earned top marks in j d power client satisfaction surveys quicken defines its culture and philosophy through a number of isms created and curated over the years by mr gilbert yes before no a penny saved is a penny we eat our own dog food at the same time several former employees and executives in interviews described a demanding work environment with staff members expected to work long hours and weekends to hit targets in recent years quicken and its affiliated companies have faced at least four lawsuits filed by former mortgage bankers seeking overtime quicken won one of the overtime cases but court documents indicate others were directed into settlement negotiations an email to the various plaintiffs lawyers was not returned and in early 2016 a national labor relations board judge ruled that quicken and five of its related companies issued an employee handbook with rules that violated workers right to engage in various activities including ones quicken has appealed the ruling calling the policies common rational and sensible when asked about criticisms of the work environment mr gilbert and other executives defended the company noting that mortgage bankers work an average of 44 hours per week and are compensated well it is possible for team members mr gilbert said to earn over 85 000 in their second year more than double the median household income for wayne county mich quicken loans growing role in parts of the mortgage market may make it a lightning rod for critics proponents say that nonbanks like quicken or pennymac in california which was started by former executives of countrywide the mortgage machine in southern california that was a hotbed of toxic mortgages in the 2008 crisis are filling an important void they argue that they serve people with low to moderate incomes or lower credit scores whom the big banks shun the big banks they say focus instead on jumbo mortgages or mortgages of more than 424 100 the maximum amount that can be backed by enterprises like fannie mae and freddie mac the large banks want to go after the business said guy d cecala the chief executive and publisher of inside mortgage finance thanks to low interest rates home sales are booming and the mortgage market was expected to top 2 trillion in originations in 2016 that s a far cry from the frothy height of 3 8 trillion that was hit in 2003 moreover many other parts of the mortgage machine that were in place leading up to the financial crisis have been dismantled still critics say today s shadow banks by focusing on the riskier end of the mortgage market may be revving up the same parts of the engine that resulted in defaults and foreclosures in the past nonbanks which are typically less capitalized and may have more difficulty reimbursing the government for bad loans now dominate f h a mortgage loans according to data from the american enterprise institute s international center on housing risk in september 2012 banks originated 65 percent of the loans insured by the f h a according to the data today that number has more than flipped nonbanks originate 73 percent of the loans with banks share dropping to 18 percent the figures are more spectacular for refinanced mortgages where nonbanks now make up 93 percent of loans the market has moved to the nonbanks because the nonbanks appetite for risk is much higher said edward j pinto a director of the center on housing risk he has argued that the f h a is not only failing to help communities with its programs but is actually weakening them with imprudent loans mr gilbert disputed any false narrative that claims quicken faces less regulatory scrutiny is lightly capitalized or makes risky loans he said that the average credit score of a quicken borrower is one of the highest in the nation that the parent company s assets are larger than that of 93 percent of all f d i c depositories and that the company is regulated by 50 states multiple municipalities and numerous federal agencies quicken loans is privately held and it is unclear what its assets are worth in an email response to questions mr gilbert added quicken loans underwriting and production is one of the highest if not the highest quality production in the entire country ',\n",
       " 'only a few years ago the dream of harnessing the strong steady gusts off the atlantic coast to make electricity seemed destined to remain just that proposals for offshore wind farms foundered on the shoals of high costs regulatory hurdles and the fierce opposition of those who didn t want giant industrial machinery puncturing the pristine ocean views now the industry is poised to take off just as the american political landscape and energy policy itself face perhaps the greatest uncertainty in a generation last fall five turbines in the waters of rhode island the country s first offshore farm began delivering power to the grid european energy developers like statoil and dong energy are making big investments to bring projects to american waters last year in massachusetts gov charlie baker a republican signed into law a mandate that is pushing development forward and in new york after years of stymied progress the long island power authority has reached an agreement with deepwater wind which built the rhode island turbine array to drop a much larger farm 15 turbines capable of running 50 000 average homes into the ocean about 35 miles from montauk if approved by the utility board on wednesday the 1 billion installation could become the first of several in a parcel with room for as many as 200 turbines that deepwater is leasing from the federal government we re developing this first offshore wind project in federal waters but it s really a gateway project to other locations around long island said thomas falcone the power authority s chief executive we re now at a point where developers can build projects at prices where utilities are willing buyers and to me that is a very big deal these projects could also become an important test case in establishing just how far states can go to to pursue their clean energy agendas under the trump administration before putting steel in the water the project would need federal approvals and policies that are in doubt amid washington s changing of the guard wind power has finally become viable for a number of delicately interlaced reasons it has taken favorable state policies and technological and economic advances to spur the current level of activity as well as interest among developers and investors including foreign oil and gas companies that see offshore wind as an important part of their corporate strategies in europe where the offshore wind industry is far ahead of the united states costs have plummeted to roughly half of what they were five years ago said thomas brostrom who runs united states operations for dong energy the danish oil and gas giant and a leading offshore wind developer as the industry has grown manufacturers have been able to take advantage of economies of scale and cut their prices at the same time turbines have grown ever larger allowing them to capture and produce more energy on the same site dong hopes to help foster similar developments in the united states the company bought leases in massachusetts and new jersey and opened an office in boston we are here to create an industry mr brostrom said there s still a ways to go but everything that we hoped would happen has happened dong has plenty of company statoil the norwegian giant has been aiming to get into the offshore business in the united states for years and proposed in 2011 to build a farm off the maine coast using floating platforms it had designed the company withdrew the project two years later amid uncertainty over changing state policies eventually deciding to build off the scottish coast now it is back having won a auction to secure a site south of jones beach on long island statoil beat out several other bidders including the state s energy agency dong and a subsidiary of iberdrola a leading energy company based in spain statoil pledged 42 5 million for the lease which still awaits final approval from the bureau of ocean energy management far more than the 16 million generated by all earlier offshore wind auctions combined there s a lot of companies starting to invest that had been wary of the u s offshore wind market and some of the initial lease sales said walter cruickshank acting director of the bureau of ocean energy management they have been coming to the table in a big way more recently the appeal of offshore winds as an energy source goes beyond their potential role in efforts to slow global warming as people flock to coastal cities where land is scarce and expensive and conventional power plants are moving toward retirement states have looked to add new forms of power production moving it out to sea has become more attractive proponents say the country s coasts home to over half the population offer some of the strongest wind resources in the world creating in theory enough energy to provide roughly four times the power the nation now produces though it is easier and cheaper to construct turbines on land the east coast in particular offers opportunity because of its strong winds and shallow waters which means turbines can operate farther out to sea and out of sight the potential of offshore wind power converged with rising demand on long island s south fork where in areas like the hamptons commercial activity was rising and property owners were building larger houses calling for more and more pool pumps in new york the long island farm is part of a plan to meet gov andrew m cuomo s goal of drawing 50 percent of the state s power from renewable sources by 2030 that includes developing 2 4 gigawatts of offshore wind he said in his state of the state address this month by far the nation s highest target equaling the capacity of the niagara falls generating station the wind array would not be visible from montauk point and difficult to see from martha s vineyard some 15 miles away said jeffrey grybowski deepwater s chief executive that makes it unlikely to stir the kind of public opposition that all but sank cape wind the ambitious development that would have positioned 130 wind machines just five miles off cape cod but stalled in a political storm over blighted vistas the rhode island project allowed deepwater to work through many of the obstacles that had been holding back the industry mr grybowski said including the lack of an established permit process and acceptance on the part of the public and the electric companies the block island project made offshore wind a reality in the united states he said so the conversations changed with utilities who want to know that you can actually deliver on a project that you re proposing to them indeed officials at the bureau of ocean energy management which approved the cape wind site in 2010 have spent years clarifying rules and identifying marine parcels suitable for wind power development in an effort to balance several concerns those include the needs of marine life and of industry along with those of coastal communities they also include the demand for economic development and clean energy sources from states concerned about both job losses and climate change since 2013 the agency has conducted six competitive auctions of leases for parcels from new england to virginia and in the past week it announced a seventh for north carolina scheduled to take place in march deepwater wind first proposed the south fork wind farm in response to a long island power authority solicitation for projects but it was ultimately rejected by the authority s board in favor of several solar farms the wind developer returned the next year with a new proposal that came close to approval a number of times but fell short now however executives have negotiated a contract that they expect the board to approve under it the utility will purchase all of the electricity delivered from the turbines by an underwater transmission line to a substation in east hampton paying a price comparable to what it would pay for other renewables like onshore wind and solar according to the utility those prices have run around 16 cents a higher than its average wholesale price of 7 5 cents deepwater plans to finance the project with a mix of loans and equity investments though it is unclear if it will be able to benefit from federal tax credits that have spurred investment in wind farms and helped reduce the price of the power they produce until this year a federal investment tax credit worth 30 percent of the development cost could be claimed that has dropped to 24 percent for projects that begin this year and is set to be phased out by the end of 2019 to qualify the project would need to demonstrate construction activity by then which could be open to interpretation by the treasury department but wind developers and advocates say the credit is also important to red states in the middle of the country where it has helped drive the spread of wind farms nurturing an offshore wind industry would meet the stated goals of many republican lawmakers and the trump administration including the pursuit of an all of the above energy program building and installing the wind machines could create thousands of new jobs as it has in the wind business in manufacturing and construction the project would also require special vessels and large onshore staging areas to assemble the components of the platforms and turbines which could help the shipbuilding and port industries we re a heavy industry that s poised to build employ and invest said nancy sopko who manages advocacy and federal legislative affairs at the american wind industry association that momentum may be difficult to slow even if new federal policies put a stop to the bureau of ocean energy management s leasing activities for wind energy its proponents say the active leases alone if developed are enough to create an industry they say and the commitments of states like new york and massachusetts and experienced multinational developers show that the struggle to harness atlantic breezes is no longer the same as tilting at windmills it is a sign of something that s inevitable which is the addition of offshore wind into the energy mix said erik gordon a clinical assistant professor at the ross school of business at the university of michigan it s just going to be too appealing in the end the
