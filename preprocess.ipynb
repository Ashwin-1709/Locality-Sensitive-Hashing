proportion that the limit under this policy bears to the total of the limits of all the policies in no case will we pay more than this proportion of the highest limit example you have an automobile

automobile you don t own here is how we will calculate the amount we will pay step 1 what is the total of the limits of all the policies 200 000 limit under policy a 300 000 limit under policy b 500 000 total under both policies step 2 what is the proportion of the limit under policy a to the total from step 1 200 000 limit under policy a 2 500 000 total under both policies 5 step 3 what is the most we will pay under this policy 2 x 300 000 highest policy limit 120 000 5 the most we would pay would be 2 5 of the loss but never more than 120 000 2 5 of the highest policy limit the other policy will pay the remaining 3 5 of the loss to a maximum of 180 000 trailers and towing trailers an automobile pulling one or more trailers will be treated as a single automobile when determining how much we will pay under liability accident benefits and uninsured automobile coverages however they will be treated as separate automobiles when determining the deductibles and how much we will pay under direct compensation property damage and optional loss or damage coverages automobiles in tow we may inspect the automobile at any reasonable time if you do not co operate in any incident involving two or more automobiles owned by different persons and attached to each other the insurer of each automobile will compensate its insured for losses according to the terms of the direct compensation property damage and optional loss or damage coverages inspection we may inspect the automobile at any reasonable time if you do not co operate with any reasonable arrangements for

a specific automobile if your certificate of automobile insurance shows a premium for it or shows the coverage is provided at no cost introduction this section of your policy provides coverage for amounts that the law holds you or other insured persons responsible for bodily injuries or losses others suffer in an automobile incident who is covered you are covered when you or anyone else in possession of a described automobile with your consent uses or operates it we will consider these other people insured persons your liability coverage applies when you or others use or operate certain other types of automobiles see section 2 for details and additional conditions what we cover you or other insured persons may be legally responsible for the bodily injury to or death of others or for damage to the property of others as a result of owning leasing or operating the automobile or renting or leasing another automobile in these cases we will make any payment on your or other insured persons behalf that the law requires up to the limits of the policy we will also reimburse anyone covered by this policy for costs involved in providing immediate medical aid needed by someone hurt in

someone sues you by accepting this policy you and other insured persons irrevocably appoint us to act on your or their behalf in any lawsuit against you or them in canada the united states of america or any other jurisdiction designated in the statutory accident benefits schedule arising out of the ownership use or operation of the automobile if someone sues you or other insured persons insured by this section for losses suffered in an automobile incident we will provide a defence and cover the costs of that defence including investigation costs we will pay all legal costs the court assesses

the court orders that falls within the liability limits of your policy we reserve the right to investigate negotiate and settle any claim out of court if we choose if you are sued for more than the limits of your policy you may wish to hire at your cost your own lawyer to protect yourself against the additional risk how much we will pay the most we will pay on your behalf and on behalf of all other insured persons insured by this section for any one incident over and above legal costs and post judgment interest will be determined by the extent of your coverage the limit under your policy is shown on the certificate of automobile insurance example you are sued for injuries suffered by another person in an accident that you are legally responsible for we will hire lawyers at our expense and cover all costs of your defence in court the court orders you to pay 10 000 in costs and 600 000 to cover losses your liability limit is 500 000 we will cover the 10 000 in costs and 500 000 of the judgment we will also pay any interest owed on that amount from the day of the judgment you will be responsible for the remaining 100 000 of the judgment and any interest owed on that outside ontario if the incident happens in a jurisdiction covered by this policy in which the minimum liability coverage required is higher than the limit shown on the certificate of automobile insurance we will honour the higher amount we also agree not to use any legal defence that would not be available if the policy had been issued in that jurisdiction example you have an accident in a province where the minimum liability coverage required is 500 000 even though you are only carrying 200 000 worth of liability insurance we will pay up to 500 000 if there is more than one named insured under this policy we will protect you and others named as insured by this policy for claims made against each other in such cases we will act as if a separate policy was issued to each named insured however the total amount we will pay over and above legal costs and post judgment interest cannot exceed the maximum coverage shown on the certificate of automobile insurance example two people are in business together both are named in the insurance policy covering their van they have bought liability coverage of 500 000 one day there is an accident while one is driving and the other is a passenger both of them are severely injured as a result of their combined negligence they sue each other and one is awarded 300 000 and the other 500 000 the combined amount we will pay will not be more than the policy limit of 500 000 plus legal costs and post judgment interest rented and leased automobiles for convenience in this subsection we use the terms rent renter and rented as equivalent to lease lessee and leased this policy provides coverage for persons who rent an automobile as described in the definitions of automobile in section 2 as a result of liability imposed by law arising from the negligence of the driver of that automobile if a liability claim is made against a driver renter or owner of a rented automobile coverage may be available under more than one motor vehicle liability policy the following rules govern the order in which the policies will respond if insurance is available to the person who rented the automobile the policy providing that insurance responds first if insurance is available to the driver of the rented automobile the policy providing that insurance responds next if insurance is available to the owner of the rented automobile the policy providing that insurance responds last we have no liability for such claims in excess of the limit of liability coverage specified in the certificate of automobile insurance and do not have the responsibility to defend such claims against anyone other than you your spouse who lives with you or the persons mentioned in subsections 2 2 3 6 and 2 2 4 6 example 1 you rent a car and your friend is driving it when an accident occurs in ontario you your friend and the rental company may face claims by other people who have sustained a loss in the accident if insurance is available to you under your policy for such claims and your friend was at fault for the accident then your policy would be first in line to pay those people if that coverage were used up and if insurance is available to your friend under his or her policy your friend s insurer would pay next if that coverage were used up any insurance available under the rental company s policy would then pay none of the insurers has to pay more than the limit of coverage that it agreed to provide example 2 your friend rents a car and you are driving it when an accident occurs in ontario you your friend and the rental company may face claims by other people who have sustained a loss in the accident if you were at fault for the accident and insurance is available to your friend under his or her policy for such claims then your friend s insurer would be first in line to pay those people if that coverage were used up and if insurance is available to you under your policy then your insurer would pay next if that coverage were used up any insurance available under the rental company s these examples are provided as a convenience only to illustrate the operation of section 277 of the insurance act ontario if there is a discrepancy between section 277 and these examples section 277 prevails in addition whether or not insurance is available under a policy in any given situation depends on the facts of that situation and the terms of the

under a motor vehicle liability policy the policy covering the other automobile must be issued by an insurance company licensed in ontario or one that has filed with the financial services commission of ontario to provide this coverage it is called direct compensation because you will collect from us your insurance company even though you or anyone else using or operating the automobile with your consent were not entirely at fault for the accident what we will cover we will pay the cost of damage to the automobile its equipment contents and for loss of use of the automobile or contents arising from an accident for which another person would have been legally responsible in the absence of section 263 of the insurance act ontario section 263 takes away your right to sue the other person for these losses we will pay no more to repair or replace the automobile or property than its actual cash value at the time it was damaged less the applicable percentage of the deductible shown on your certificate of automobile insurance if a part needed to repair the automobile is no longer available we will pay an amount equal to the manufacturer s latest list price for the part note you should be aware that this coverage does not apply if the automobile is described in another motor vehicle liability policy example you are driving a friend s car that car is described in your friend s motor vehicle liability policy you have an accident for which you are not at fault your friend will claim under the direct compensation property damage provisions of his or her motor vehicle liability policy for the loss we will not pay for damage to or loss of use of contents that are being carried for reward who is covered in a claim for damage to the automobile the owner of the automobile is covered for damage in a claim for damage to the contents of the automobile the owner of the contents is covered for damage how much we will pay determining fault the amount we pay under this section of your policy will be determined by the degree to which you or the driver were not at fault in the accident responsibility for an accident is determined by the insurance act ontario and the fault determination rules these may find you or the driver wholly or partially responsible the degree of responsibility is expressed as a percentage the deductible the amount we pay may be subject to a direct compensation property damage deductible the deductible is the amount you agree to pay toward the cost of any single claim you make under this section the deductible if any is the amount shown on the certificate of automobile insurance multiplied by the percentage to which you or the driver of the automobile were not at fault for the accident you are not permitted to sue anyone for instance the at fault motorist to recover this deductible if you have damage to both your automobile and its contents the deductible will first be applied to your automobile loss if there is any remaining deductible the remainder will be applied to the contents loss you will need to make a separate claim for each accident that causes damage the deductible applies each time you make a claim and separately to each automobile that is insured we will pay that portion of the total damages that is equal to the percentage to which you or the driver of the automobile were not at fault for the accident less the applicable direct compensation property damage deductible example 1 the other driver is entirely responsible your car has an actual cash value of 12 000 you are involved in an accident for which someone else is 100 responsible your car is a total loss your direct compensation property damage dc pd deductible is 500 we will pay 11 500 12 000 less 500 the deductible we will also pay for reasonable alternate transportation in sum you receive 11 500 you are responsible for 500 the dc pd deductible example 2 you are partly responsible no optional loss or damage coverages your car has an actual cash value of 12 000 you are involved in an accident and are 25 responsible your car is a total loss your direct compensation property damage dc pd deductible is 300 under dc pd we cover the damages less the deductible for which the other driver would have otherwise been responsible you are responsible for the deductible we will pay 8 775 9 000 being 75 of the value of your automobile less 225 being 75 of the deductible in sum you receive 8 775 you are responsible for 225 the dc pd deductible and will have to pay the remainder out of your own pocket in this example you will be out of pocket for a total of 3 225 however you may be entitled to recover part of that amount if you have bought additional optional loss or damage coverages under section 7 example 3 damage to contents suppose you have just rented a floor sander currently worth 600 from the local rent all when you are involved in an accident you are 25 responsible for the accident the sander is destroyed your direct compensation property damage dc pd deductible is 500 we will pay 75 450 being 75 of the value of the sander less 375 being 75 of the deductible in sum you will receive 75 you are responsible for 375 the dc pd deductible and that portion of the damage for which you are responsible example 4 damage to automobile and contents you are involved in an accident for which you are not responsible the repair of your car costs 250 contents worth 125 are destroyed your direct compensation property damage dc pd deductible is 300 we will pay 0 250 less 250 toward your car damage and 75
